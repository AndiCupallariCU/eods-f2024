"My cats are considerably more happy with this toy...and I don't have to leave the sofa to use it, given the long wand length. yay laziness!!",5
Made in China. No Good,5
This is a great bowl. Nicely made and easy to clean.  Can't go wrong. You will like the bowl I assure you.,5
"Great hide for a Leopard Gecko as stated by everyone else. I was wondering how this compares to the Zoo Med hide. So, I purchased both. Here is what I think:  The Medium Zoo Med cave is a bit larger than the medium Exo Terra cave and just a bit smaller than the large Exo Terra if anyone was wondering. For an adult gecko, the medium Zoo Med is great (or the large), but with ExoTerra you might want to go with the large size.

The Exo Terra is more of a resin material, while the Zoo Med is more like ceramic. There can be some sharp edges on the inside lip of the Exo Terra that a little sand paper fixes right up, though I doubt the edges are an issue anyway.

Hole placement: I used to make hides from poly foam, and I found that LGs like hides where they climb down into the hide. The Zoo Med hide hole placement is like that - the gecko climbs down into the hide. Not a big deal and not a deal breaker, but the Exo Terra hide has the hole on the side down low. Just an observation, and the gecko will likely care less anyway.

So that is some info for you. I have both in my adult gecko's cage. Can't go wrong with either. This hide style is better than any half-log, etc. My advice is to lay this partially over the heat, with about 1/4 to 1/3 of it over a non-heated area. This way the gecko can thermo-regulate inside the cave without having to choose either an all-warm cave or an all-cold cave.",4
"These cat claws went on easy, no problem what so ever! My cute little Kitty was climbing the curtains, now he doesn't even try. He doesn't seem to mind them and they look so cute on him.",5
my husky has taken an instant liking to this product. he has chewed every side but hasn't destroyed it yet and loves to throw it around.,5
"I bought this same toy 15 years ago! It was the first toy I bought my new puppy, brings back sweet memories.",5
I really like this fence for my blind 8 pound little girl (dog). I needed something to keep her from falling into the swimming pool.,5
"These used to be orange, weren't they?

Anyhow, there aren't many squeaky toys that can handle the punishment of multiple dogs playing with it at an animal shelter.  I volunteer at my local dog shelter every weekend.  I've seen toys come and go out in those play yards, and I'm always surprised when each week the squeaky KONG balls STILL WORK!
-
These can take a beating!  And dogs LOVE the balls that make noise - they are WAY more likely to chase a ball that makes noise.  They like it when you squeeze it in your hand, then chuck it, letting it make a squeak noise as it flies through the air!  They just adore these things!
-
I saw there was another version of these on here, like a ""birthday"" version which is multi-colored.  People have reviewed those as being weak, but this one - this is the real deal.  Heavy-duty Kong stuff that you'd expect.
-
Also, these are like double the cost shown here in stores.  I was in PetSmart the other day and was shocked to see how much more these were in stores.  Buy them here.  I do!",5
"Was exactly what I needed. It is fairly firm. I purchased it to wear while working on our hard wood floors. My neck was killing me from holding my head up while crawling around pulling staples, scrapping and sanding the floor to refinish it. This cervical collar is firm enough to help support my head but not too firm to entirely restrict movement.",5
Great product. My cat looks so cute I walk in the back yard just so she can get fresh air. It is very secure I am glad i bought it,5
This worked perfectly for my pet door and saved a lot of time by me not having to build supports for the cutout used for my door.,5
"First I was shocked at the size.  A little bigger than advertised, actually . Second the quality of it was great - it didn't ""stink"" like some bones I've gotten in the past.  My dog is a little older now (10.5 years) so she doesn't go through bones as quickly as before, and this one lasted quite a while.  Very solid, no chips or sharp points to it and it doesn't snap apart like some more brittle bones have, either - it more or less grinds down with their chewing.  I highly recommend this product, and for only $5 you're getting more than you pay for in my opinion.",5
Just adopted a shelter cat who is a bit shy. He loves enclosed spaces like my closet. This igloo is great. Lightweight but sturdy and soft. He curls up in there and can see out the front. Definitely worth the purchase!,5
as expected,5
"Uncomfortable, my dog hated it and it totally ruined his trips to the dog park. Consistent training and socializing worked way better than using this Hannibal Lecter looking device. If anyone wants this one, I'll give it to them for free.",1
Got this for my puppy who loves to chew thinking it would be nice since you freeze it and he played with it 2 minutes before it broke open and the liquid in it started to come out.. I def won't purchase this again.,1
Looks great,5
"Pugs are NOT finicky eaters - still mine gobbles this up and loves it as much as any food I've tried on him. He weighed 18 lbs. when I first started him on this and reminded me of a fat little sausage. He has almost finished one 26 lb. bag and has lost 3 lbs. and is holding at a steady 15 lbs. now. I feed him 1/4 c. in the morning and 1/3 c. in the evening. And....2 - 3 times a week I give him a ""treat"". The food does what is supposed to. Vet says he couldn't be healthier!",5
"My dog has worn this for a couple weeks now. We get a lot of compliments on it. It has held up to much play time, including time at doggie daycare. It has not broken or come apart. Still looks like new. Very happy. I attached her name tag to it and it still looks great.",5
"Perfect for my 3 pooches, great price.",5
works ok but Im switching to oral medication to help with allergies better. This is not as good as comfortis,3
"Don't know what it will do to my dogs yes, but they don't mind it and it smells good.",5
Works!,5
"My 11-year-old jack russell terrier has had problems with her anal glands for YEARS. They would fill up so fast and she'd constantly be dragging herself or ""scooting"" to try to express them. None of the vets ever told us that this could be solved by adding more fiber to her diet. This stuff started working right away! We noticed her stools getting more firm after one day. We sprinkle this on her food and she actually likes the flavor! I haven't seen her scoot since we started using this! :)",5
its not all that great. i mean my dog likes it most of the time when hes starving and we haven't given him some real chicken and meat that  night. i think it makes his stool very dry sometimes and hard for him to go. i doubt i will purchase this again.,3
Love this product!:),5
It's good for the price:). The whole thing doesn't heat up just the size of the warmer inside which is long and skinny and the bed is square.  But good for the price.,3
"I liked it until I had to wash it, after that...and even somewhat before that... It started to topple sideways. It didn't hold it's shape well and I had to go buy hard sided carriers.",3
"This is a great cat tree!  It is a nice height- goes up to 72 inches... quite clean and new looking- a ""carpet like"" material- but seemingly of adequate thickness.  The particle board that constructs it leads one to believe it is flimsy looking, but it stands quite firm and tall.  Its compact a lot of tree packed into not too wide of a piece of furniture.  My other 72 inch tree takes up more space.  (  I wanted to ""bookend"" my fireplace.  lol) It does shake a little, but overall it is quite firm- the last thing on my mind is that it will collapse under my 10 pound cat.  There are a lot of pieces- obviously with the different levels and houses there has to be.  But EVERY NEEDED screw and part was sent with an excellent diagram,  by GO PET CLUB.  In fact this is my 2nd tree from them and every part and screw was present in both!  Thank u G.P.C.!!!.  I'd like to add that the tree is packed into an extremely compact box- should readily fit into any car trunk or back seat!  I thought I might have to rent a small u- haul- but it's really interesting the way the company knows how to pack so well!  Must be a ""package design engineer"" in the picture.  It actually took me 5 hours to assemble this cat tree.  By the time you lay  out the parts and screws... screw everything together correctly  etc.  I got a little stuck on one shelf- it more or less ""attaches to a higher shelf- (we're talking at the upper level )  and there are two ""stabilizing bolts""-  but any adult should ultimately figure it out- Quite easy actually but you have to recognize how the bolts attach.  Just use the diagram and the holes in the boards as a guide.  However 90% of the steps to assemble are quite straightforward. Very reasonably priced- I guess it is so because the buyer must assemble- which does take a bit of time and energy- u might even work up  a sweat!  However, I really had "" a feeling of accomplishment"" upon completion.!!!  Now if my cat just hops up and down on it.....!",5
Very nice sized plant. Looks great in my tank! Arrived healthy and ready to go in.,5
nice tag,5
Smells like a flea collar yuck.,2
I have to really mix it into my cat's food or he won't touch it. The other kind I used before he would gobble up with it sprinkled right on top of the food. Haven't gotten enough into him to tell results b/c I can't mix a whole serving in or he won't eat it at all.,3
My betta loves it and does not rip his fins!  A lot of times i'll find him swimming through them or laying on them and he seems to enjoy them.  I have had this for about a month and no rip fins!,5
"This food was recommended by my dog's veterinarian and she loves it...I notice a difference in her coat and
her energy.",5
"There's a lot of literature about proper pet diet these days, with large pet food manufacturers taking a lot of heat for using cheap and dangerous materials in their products.  My cats have been on Fancy Feast for several years and always have nice coats, no dandruff, healthy skin, eyes, stools, etc.  I've recently switched the bulk of my cat""s diet to raw meat with a supplement vitamin powder, but still keep the Fancy Feast around as a backup.  I've seen modest changes to my cat's appearance and behavior since transitioning her diet to raw meat, but I'm quite confident that Fancy Feast maintains the proper nutrition to keep my cat healthy and vibrant.",5
I've found these to be the best priced Hartz pads so far.,5
"Based on reviews I purchased the large, but it was too small for my 90 pound dog. Unfortunately I have to send it back the same day I received it. It seems comfortable, not very thick though. The packaging was pretty bad, it was folded and stuffed into the smallest shipping bag and taped up all around. Ill be lucky if I can reuse the same packaging to return it.",3
cats are happy,5
"This is a great cleaner of the gravel. The reason I gave 3 stars is because I had to put in some effort to make it work.

The bottom plastic part is a bit loose. It keeps moving loosely.

Also, the noticeable lower most portion of the tube with carved openings, prevent the vacuum from working well. I had to wrap up the bottom opening part with a plaster to make it work.",3
"Still debating between this and orijen.
I fed my cat Taste of the Wild for 3 years, seems to be the best product quality price ratio.
I have the luxury of a cat that eats at its own pace without going overweight actually very fit (a relatively small male part  maincoon part tabby at 14lbs), so I always put more than I know he will eat in a day (and avoid being awaken at night for wanting food).

Very noticeable difference from cheap food to this, better fluffier coat within two months, even while being indoor/outdoor. Now forced to be indoor only (not by choice sadly, apartment life) my cat coat was even nicer.

I'm currently trying orijen, which my cat loves even more, which from research seems to be even better quality but also three times the price per weight, orijen seems to have made my cat more active in a good way, he eats less of it, 1/2 to 2/3 of Taste of the Wild amount. so 3 times the price in volume actually turns to about twice the price over time. His stools with orijen are softer than they were with Taste of the Wild, and did need a slow transition, from being on Taste of the Wild for a few years
Due to the higher cost of orijen I may end up going at the half way road, mixing both this Taste of the Wild and orijen",5
"Just received two of these for my very messy cats. They seem to be an appropriate size for small cat bowls and so far have reduced the mess. Someone else mentioned that they didn't like the ridges. However I like that it has ridges to catch the spill. It is made out of a hard rubber so should rinse off fairly easily when the time comes. Did not have a strong odor either. So far, would buy again",5
One cat did not like it four days later. I will look later for another brand.,1
Works pretty good within 24 hours to start killing fleas buy for a strong flea infestation like in the summertime you'll have to use it once a month for at least three months as flea eggs can hatch every 2 to 10 days and if your cat shows any signs of acting funny or weird then just simply shower off your kitty quickly as rarely some kitties are allergic just like some of us are allergic to some medications and the try Advantage on that kitty. Also you need to vacuum your house weekly or twice weekly starting out and disinfect and wipe out areas you think that flea eggs could have fallen into. This product also can be used with Capstar which is a pill that will kill adult fleas within 15 minutes works great and is one third the price but it's a one time treatment adult fleas only so I found it good to use Capstar within a few days of putting on Frontline and then again the following week to assure the infestation was gone as my little calico is allergic to flea bites and breaks out badly with just one flea.,4
"I purchased this little brush to help groom our mini Aussie puppy and get him used to the process.  It is small enough to fit into my small hands easily, and its size makes it easy to work in small areas such as the ears and paws. Its soft bristles are gentle enough that it doesn't scare or scratch the puppy. I find it's easy to clean the hair out of the brush by simply running a dog comb through the slicker bristles.",5
Good product,4
"I purchased two balls .. the first ball lasted about 4 mins, then quit.  The second ball my dog popped open in about 8 mins.  I was disappointed.  They are not meant for larger dogs or dogs that play aggressive.  I think these balls are meant for smaller dogs.. Although for the few mins they swatted them around on floor, they enjoyed.. It was a expensive purchase for only a few mins.",2
I use this as training treats and kong stuffers.  The dogs love them and I like that they have a smell that gets the dogs attention!,5
Perfect size for my cat's am feeding...not stinky and trays go right into the recycle!!,5
I could not get it out of the package fast enough for my puppy she was so excited for it.,5
"I myself didn't actually try them, but my two boys (dogs) loved them, we will definitely buy them in the future.  Thanks again for the sample, it was greatly appreciated.",5
"My cats like it, so what else matters? I bought it for them so they would feel more occupied during snack time instead of inhaling their dry food/treats. The younger cats took to it right away. The oldest cat has no interest in it whatsoever, but he isn't interested in much of anything.

I find it amusing to watch them work the food out of all 4 puzzles.",4
Works great.  Use for a Pomeranian.  Good price on this amount,5
Good and soft brush for short haired dogs such as my Boston.,4
"So far it is not destroyed. I have a border collie who destroys the ""indestructible"" I e-mailed the company before hand to make sure that buying it on Amazon I would still be able to get a replacement if he did indeed destroy it. They responded very quickly and let me know to keep my receipt but they would be happy to refund their product if there were any issues. It has been a week and so far the ball is still alive and well. It is very dense, In the picture it makes it look like there is some divets but for the most part the ball is pretty solid (and ball shaped). If you have a toy destroyer like me definitely give this one a try! It is a bit expensive but considering the warranty the company stands behind; it is well worth it!",4
"The reviews sold me on this product, but my cat wasn't receptive.  One broke upon being tossed for kitty to play with.",2
Good for the parrotlets to cling too.,5
"Doesn't actually grind nails just slowly spins , worthless",1
The birds of all types love this food.,5
"Our dog was eating his food way, way too fast.  I ordered this bowl and he still eats fast, however he can only eat small bits of food at a time instead of snarfing down great big huge mouthfuls which is much safer.

The large bowl works well for a labrador sized dog.  I ordered the medium by mistake and it would hold about a cup of food, but it is better suited for a smaller dog with a smaller nose/snout.",5
"My mini dachshunds love to burrow, so these cave beds have always been great for them.  Price was very reasonable, and now I know why.  The fabric is very flimsy compared to the beds we've had in the past.",3
Does what its intended to do. Slow our dog from gobbling down her food and then getting sick later. I swear she eats her food like we are starving her to death and it's the last meal she will ever have. This has both slowed down her eating process and also created a puzzle for her as she has to be methodical in how she tries to get access to the kibble.,5
"I have 2 shih-tzu crosses & bought one for each. These fit well & more important, they stay closed. Your dog will not be getting out of these. I have a few harnesses & I  count on these for traveling. They seem to be comfortable for both of our girls as neither one fights around while wearing them. I'm pretty sure you'll be very happy with them also..",5
"Only pellet my Conure will eat.  She likes the finer grind better though, but she does eat these.
She likes to be hand fed and lets me watch her eat this.  She's about 22 years old and a real fussy ol' lady.",4
"My goto litter!  I have ferrets and am very cautious about what I used in their boxes.  I love that this product is all natural, bio-degradable, naturally clumping, flushable and best of all.... controls odor better than any recycled newspaper litter.  Another positive, is that this product naturally clumps instead of turning to sawdust like a feline pine or wood stove chips do, so its safer for the critters respiratory system.",5
Great price and the cats love it. Must be pretty filling as well since neither of our cats will over eat it. We give them the suggested portions and they don't typically finish it off till the next meal time.,5
"Finally found the right combination of dry and wet cat food for kitties with delicate digestive systems. Second bag ordered along with cans (salmon) seems to the trick. Both cats have put on weight and coats, energy, etc. have improved. Vet said allergies weren't food related, but seasonal. I believe both impact these felines and why weve tried various brands.",5
easy to install,4
Much smaller than the advertised sizing.  I measured my dog and bought a size up and it is still too small.,3
A little unwieldy but it works fine.,4
"My pups like it in the cooler weather and it's easy to clean---just pop into the washer.
No messy zippers that break or catch on fabric. For fitting purposes, my Tibetan Terriers are about 40 lbs and the size works well.",5
"My Newfoundland loves this can.  This past two years we have been giving this to her as part of her Thanksgiving feast. My children enjoy picking this out for her before Thanksgiving. Grinning that she will get to have her own Thanksgiving feast too. It seems very special for my kids to share the festivities with her on that special day.

Merrick prides itself with safe pet food, They only use ingredients made in the U.S and from farms they know and trust.
There website says they do not use anything from China. Which is hard to find now a days, even if products say made in USA that doesn't mean all the ingredients are from U.S. There is a loop hole, manufactures do not have to write where the ingredients came from as long as they combined products and made it to be pet food in the states they can label it as made in USA.
After doing some research and finding out, just looking for made in USA or buying food that are expensive didn't mean anything for the safety of my pets it really made me very uneasy feeding them.
I am very happy to of found a product that specifically informs consumers, NO usage of the very thing I wanted to avoid ""Ingredients from China"" .",5
grows fast. dies faster.,2
"**UPDATE**  I've been using this for 3 months now and it hasn't slipped or fallen ONCE. My cat is enjoying more as the summer turns to fall, probably because it's not so hot! Very pleased with the Kitty Cot and would recommend for cats everywhere!

I had wanted to buy my cat a window perch for years. I couldn't get around the cheap quality of perches I found in pet stores. Plus, I'm a renter, so the thought of patching up more holes in the wall when I would move out wasn't appealing. My cat seemed to enjoy sitting on the window ledges at my apartment, so I just gave up the search.

Recently, I moved into a new apartment and there aren't any window ledges large enough for my cat to sit on. I feel like she's getting seasonal affective disorder because of a lack of window time. The quest for the perch continued until I found the Kitty Cot.

At first, I was put off by the price, but ordered it anyway. Totally worth it! Great construction and quality materials. As advertised, the suction cups are heavy duty and had no problem sticking to my *now clean* 1940s windows.

My cat liked it a lot better once I put her favorite blanket and a toy on it. She uses it to bird watch during the day and curl into a ball for naps at various times.

See photo for evidence of a happy kitty.",5
A staple at home.,5
"Worked great the first two times my 14 week Aussie played with it. After the third time, it was in pieces. Would not recommend.",2
"I don't know what all the hoo-hah I read in reviews about this product was about. This thing is amazing! My dog has very short fur but has been shedding like crazy. When we were outside playing fetch today, I took the FURminator outside and used it on her in the middle of the play session.

I cant believe how much fur it caught. All the undercoat. She seemed to like it. She stood still and let me keep using it without whining or trying to get away. It was like it felt good to her.

And her coat was just beautiful after about four passes. So shiny!

So, I give this gizmo 5+ Stars.",5
Poor quality :( the pillow inside is way to small for the bed.. would not recommend this product  .. very disappointed,1
"The cats absolutely love this. I took my time letting them see it, smell it, rub up against it....I never push down, just let it glide across their body. They really enjoy it, and I was surprised by how much hair it picks up",5
Very consistent temperatures,5
"Ziggy my 2lb yorkie loves to this go with his crate., and fits the 20"" Firsttrax perfectly.. arrived in perfect condition and on time.. Price is the best",5
My Kittens like it.,4
"Very good idea in having nylon rather than chain in a choke collar. I liked the build and style of the collar but I wouldn't buy it again. The collar itself was way to thin for a larger dog and it was only offered in three (approx.) sizes all only 1/4 of an inch or less in difference. I only used the collar for two weeks before it began to look very worn and frayed. Also because of the thinness of the nylon it seemed, to me, that it was a bit more harsh on my dogs neck than a regular chain collar.
I recently purchased a thicker rectangular rather than rounded 20 inch nylon collar that has approx. 4 inches of chain for a quick release after a correction, the Hamilton was very slow to release if it did at all, I found myself manually fixing it more often than not.
I don't recommend this collar.",2
My two Afghan Hounds just love these.,5
This is a great brush for my cats. Hair removal is a breeze. Both my cats love being brushed and it helps decrease the shedding.,5
works great. My dog goes in the lake with it on and still works. three people on the block have this and we all like it,5
"These work great for my cat's. when the house gets noisy with a lot of company, and  my cats get scared with new people in the house this helps them a lot. I find that they don't stay hidden as long as they do if I have none in the house. I also have one cat that is has a stronger personality then the other and with out these she will go after her sister. with these they will sleep together.  I recommend this product.",5
"Great product and the only thing that has worked to keep my cats off the area I don't want them on.
The description of the product might sound mean to some people, but the reality seems to be that the cats instinctively know to stay off.
They offer a ""dummy"" matte, but my smart cats walk all over those!!",5
"Love, Love, LOVE!!! I will be purchasing the 3-step one soon!",5
"It is large, right where your fingers hold it. Not thrilling.",3
I tried 3 different harnesses for my puppies before I found one that was easy to get on them and hard for them to chew through -- this one does the trick!,5
My dogs really enjoy these bones and the flavorit holes keep them entertained.,5
"I purchased this product before and it seemed quite sturdy and worked well.  However, as my dog grew, he became a bit more persistent in his efforts to get in the front seats with us. Pawing at the cover did eventually tear it.  The product worked well for seat coverage though, so we purchased two more along with a barrier to put between the front seats.",4
"These broke and splintered immediately, my dog swallowed a large piece and threw up immediately...Very poor quality. These are not normal bully sticks.",1
This is the only canned food our cats will eat!,5
My Saint Bernard waits every morning for her joint treats....Smells the same as the chews I got at the vets for 3 times the price.,5
Did not work.,2
My hamster liked 10+,4
"It blends in with my living room nice, so I don't mind seeing it as a cat accessory in my house. My cats love playing with it, they jump all over it and play with the ball all the time. It's a tad wobbly, but they don't seem to mind. It's an easy yes purchase.",4
"excellent water filter cansiter for tanks of 55 Gls and more , espcially if you keep a bunch of cichlid fish",5
"I won't deny that all the good reviews are true - for all the years that I used it, Swheat was one of the best litters I've ever used.  But I had a heck of a shock in the realization that over the years my male cat had become ALLERGIC to it.  Humans can become allergic to all sorts of things over the years, but it took a chance comment from a friend to realize that that was why my poor male cat had licked himself BALD on the belly and was chewing on his paws to the point where he was causing himself injury.  When I immediately switched over to a clay-based scoop litter (after giving the boxes a thorough cleaning), he started to heal immediately, much to the astonishment of my vet.  He'd never heard of such a thing, and he's glad he did because he knows to keep an eye on other cats with similar problems.  No, not every cat will become allegic - that's why I gave the litter such a good rating.  But be careful and keep an eye on it.",5
"Well constructed but does not deliver on its no-pull advertising. Purchased this with the expectation that it would provide incentive to not pull. If they did not advertise this as no-pull, I would give it five stars for construction and comfort.",2
my Boston Terrier looks very nice with this sweater.,5
This brush is so soft it doesn't even feel like I am brushing my papillons coat but this brush really shines when brushing the delicate fringes.  My papillons now like having their ears brushed!,4
"I have a small poodle, 11 years old, and her hair has really started to thin. A groomer recommended I purchase this conditioner to use on her. It smells AMAZING and I can tell a difference each time I use it on her hair. You can't tell how bad of shape her hair is in as long as I continue to use this product.",5
Decent quality but will need to be rustgaurded if used outside,3
Works great! Easy to use and clean,5
"The dogs love it, it is however very heavy when dropped on your foot. I bought one initially to see how they would like it and ended up buying three more.",5
My boxer mix had it destroyed within thirty minutes!,1
This couch looks great in the living room and is low enough where my puppy can just jump on it and relax. The only complaint is the cushions were not very soft.,3
My pit bull loves this!! Gets her brain going!,5
"So I loved this at first because it is just so convenient. I would let it fill halfway, clean it out with a Clorox wipe, and start over again. Then the Litter Champ itself starting stinking ssooo badly. EVERYTIME I made a deposit the lingering smell would be worse than just the litter. When I emptied it the smell would fill my bathroom for hours because the plastic it is made of just absorbed all of the odor. No amount of cleaning or airing out could stop it, and I had to let it go",3
Great item. It is super quiet. Only problem is our little dwarf hamster has a hard time turning it. Would be OK for a normal size rodent.,5
"After countless hours of researching I decided on Taste of the Wild dog food.  Its grain free, high in protein, decently priced, several different flavors, and my dog loves it.",5
"They loved him,but not for heavy chewers",4
Great value for the quantity and quality.  Our Amazon parrot is fed these pellets and fresh foods only. I love that it's not dyed and full of ingredients that are unnecessary. He's healthy and happy.  And maybe a bit spoiled. We have purchased many times and will continue as long as it is available.,5
"Good Quality so five stars and good elastic, however I also purchased other styles
These are cute however they are not as nice as other selections.",5
The package arrived in a promptly (meaning the previous dog food didn't run out).  Our dog seems to love this food!,5
Perfect leashes for my two cockapoos :),5
"Great Harness, although it does choke them on their chest (not neck) so just make sure your dog doesnt pull you. But regardless, its better than a regular harness. I would DEFINATELY recommend this!",4
I was impressed this bad boy held fast for my pup...  the only thing I suggest is to carry a short bar for leverage in case you encounter hard dirt! Just put it through the triangular handle and use it to rotate this bad boy into the hard pack!  Booya!  -Brusimm,5
"I'm a bit disappointed in this toy. We have multiple others from Kong - which are always in circulation and always a huge hit. But this one has a funny ""coat"" on it. The yellow fuzz pulls away easily, and I'm just too afraid my cat will ingest it. This has remained in a drawer from the moment I opened the package.",3
Cats immediately loved this! I've bought other products from this company and the quality is always top notch.,5
"I purchased this product to get rid of the ""smell"" my little dog seems to get after a few days of playing outside.  It doesn't really deodorize anything, nor does it lather (which I was aware of) however you have to use a ton just to bathe a little 10 lb. dog!  Also, it seems to make my dog itchy.  I have determined he has sensitve skin (still searching for a shampoo to help with the itchies), this product is NOT for dogs with sensitive skin...or any dog that you want to be clean for that matter.",1
"It is much easier to clean my dogs' ears with these pads.  I will say my dogs don't like their ears clean so after they tend to get the zoomies and run around messing up all the furniture trying to ""dry"" their ears even though I dried them already.  I would have really liked if there were some tips on how to make this process more comfortable for dogs that could've come with the purchase.",4
"Nice on my cats fur and I love the ease of getting the hair/fur out of this product, too",5
"My cats use this everyday since I purchased. They love it so much, they chomp on it.",5
I am one happy mommie he loves the taste of it I have no problem giving it to him. And he get all the vitamins in it to thank you for a great product:),5
Both of my cats love it. Healthy ingredients at reasonable cost.,5
Too small,1
"I should have gotten a medium, the large is a little to big. I do love the color and the pattern.",3
I felt the product caused a reaction on the dog's paws as if it burnt them up. Now i am having to treat them with a prescription from the Vet also right after I put this on they would lick and lick and start biting there paws. I feel this did more harm them good.,1
fits great and is very well made.,5
Food made a huge improvement in all my dogs' skin and coats,5
"I decided to try the Kong inflatable Cloud collar for my dog after realizing the time that would be required for her foot wounds to heal. The standard plastic cone e-collars I had been using were helpful but more uncomfortable for her, digging into her neck when lying down. So this softer Kong collar solved that problem, while creating others.
I agree with reviewers who say this inflatable collar might not work as well for recovery of front paw wounds and incisions, or for very determined pets who obsessively lick. The collar still allows access to the pet's feet below, center front, at the closure where there is almost no padding. It could be turned to keep the widest inflated area under the pet's chin, but is easily rotated by the pet. It is best if cinched tighter to keep the neck fully protected.

My 12-pound dog was happier with the light weight of the Kong Cloud collar, but was eventually able to maneuver and bite/lick the rear leg wound (even though fully inflated). I guess without the rigidity of the plastic e-collars, there is less resistance to turning the head. Perhaps the discomfort of harder e-collars is also a good deterrent.

I recommend this Kong collar for supervised walks, mealtimes, bedtime use, overnight or when an owner will be present. It is a good alternative to the rigid plastic e-collars, but can't be relied on to protect front leg or paw wounds, as the Velcro closure space is thinner, not as inflated and might allow access to wounds. It works best with pets with smaller heads, shorter snouts, that don't extend far beyond the collar.

It might disappoint and fail to stop your pet's licking for flexible, determined pets, as happened with my dog. Consider alternating it with a more rigid cone-type e-collar to keep your pet safer.

Examples of a second rigid e-collar for back-up use with Kong's Cloud collar:

"My Toy Poodles seem to like it, but not as their only food.  I swap it out with their favorite to offfer them some variety.",5
I use these with SoPhresh puppy pads. My dog sometimes misses the paper & these catch her mistakes.,5
Thanks so much. It works great.,5
Serves my needs. Wish it came in a 30 liner choice.,5
This is a great product. My cats love it and it gives them clean water to drink. I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my other home.,5
Our dog loves these toys!,5
"Having 3 Standard Poodles I was getting tired of paying nearly $300 every 6 weeks to have them all groomed.  I started with my Wahl Bravura and watched lots of grooming videos on You Tube, and learned how to clip their faces, paws, etc.  Now I've worked up the courage to use these AMAZING combs.. they came free with my Bravura from Ryan's Pet Supplies last year.  I didn't have the nerve to use them for several months, until I started watching videos.  These combs are nothing short of miraculous.  SO easy to use, my dogs look like they came straight from the grooming salon after I've done them.  Be sure to wash, blow dry and brush and comb out your dogs completely before using these combs.  Honestly, my dog look as if they'd been hand scissored.  LOVE these combs.  My Standards have a LOT of thick hair, and these combs glide right through their coats.",5
"My box turtle didn't care for it.  The product was very fresh though, good meal for lizards and frogs.",3
"My dogs loved these.
I like that they're not rawhide and easily digestible.
When I got these they were a great deal.",5
best flea tic and mosquitoes  repellent i have ever used for my dogs,5
"Two paws up for this bed ! Frank loves it, as you can see. It is plenty roomy, soft and comfy. I only wish they would make one in my size !",5
"This is not really ""engraved"".",3
My dog has no complains about these treat... In fact he loves them because they are soft but chewy.,5
The cats give Greenies 5 stars and so does McMonigle's veterinary clinic! A superior product!,5
Best Purchase EVER!!!  Have a 8 week old VERY messy puppy- this has 100% taken care of the spills and food mess.  Good quality and easy to clean.  I plan on buying a larger one once my puppy grows out of it.,5
Love this stuff for my dogs.,5
"Our puppy killed it in about 15 minutes,  but that's more than the usual 2 lol",2
Great carrier for our growing cat!,5
"Was nice at first because it kept my dog from scratching at the backdoor for a couple of days. I let her out in the backyard with her sister (another dog) and if I have to go inside to do anything for even a second, she jumps up on the door (unknowingly breaking our screen door with each jump) and stays there and cries, even if she has to go to the bathroom. She'll hold it to cry. This actually worked after she stepped on the mat to cry a couple of times and realized she didn't like the feeling. So she avoided laying on the stairs/doorway and crying/jumping for a couple of days. On the second day that we had the mat down, it rained, and my husband and I tested the mat afterwards and realized it wasn't functioning anymore. We left the mat down that evening and realized that our dog still seemed to be avoiding stepping on the mat for a prolonged period of time, such as hanging out there as opposed to just stepping on it as she walks over it to get inside the door. So, we kept the mat down thinking maybe the mat (during the short time that it lasted) had conditioned her to not sit at the door scratching and crying... but unfortunately, it only took a couple of steps on it for her to realize that it didn't work anymore and before we knew it, she was laying directly on the mat crying the second we let her outside. So, this would in fact be a great product if it were able to withstand the outdoors. I'd certainly buy it again if they came up with a weatherproof / more weather resistant technology!",2
My digs loved them.,5
"Perfect fit for my 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe ultimate! Really stays in place great sturdy material, but soft enough for the dogs. Glad I purchased",5
"This collar is SO much better than ones I've  bought in the past.  Last time, I felt the one I purchased was inhumane.  This doesn't seem to scare my dog, but it does keep him from barking.  This is a great product!",5
Arrives quickly and the larger quantity lasts longer.,5
"One size is too snug the size up is too big.  It would be nice if they had more sizes.  The product itself I like, I love the color helps me see my dog at night when I let him out to potty at night time.",4
"The squeak is kind of pathetic sounding and not loud, but my dog loves to chase these.",4
Cats love this food,5
"This is a very nice nail trimmer that I just purchased to replace the old one that was worn out for our dog. I have a chocolate lab, so I needed the large trimmer.

The trimmer itself is very durable, comfortable to use, nice and sharp and cuts smoothly, everything you want in a trimmer.

The only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is because it is listed as a large dog nail trimmer, and I don't really thing it is big enough for large dogs. My lab is a dwarf, (47 lbs), and it is just big enough for her. If I were to use this on my parents lab (67 lbs) I don't think that this would quite be large enough. I am happy with it for my purposes, but I think if you have a dog over 50 lbs you'll want to look for one that is larger.",4
"A little smaller than I was expecting, but great product for the price.  I travel to dog agility shows and it is a nice space saver in the car.",4
We got these after seeing a tv commercial that they are more easily digestible than rawhides and better for dogs overall.. Our lab loves them and will continue to get them for him.,5
There are the only ones I use now,5
My dogs are getting older and they have allergies so I mix some of the duck & potato in with their dry dog food and they like that.,5
This bag is really cool. I love the color and I really liked the many pockets so I can pet my cat when hes feeling scared. I got the biggest one I could because I have pretty big cats and even with them in there its easy to carry and they seem calm and okay. Sometimes if I leave it out they even sleep in it for the day which is pretty impressive because my cats are pretty scared of most carrier.,5
"Fits the large bag of Canidae.  Love how I can roll it out of the way when vacuuming.  Easy open, easy close.",5
"Our Dutch Shepard is an aggressive chewer.  It took him less than an hour to chew the rope off / out of this toy.  He has also punctured it in a couple of places.  He love it though!  And the ball itself, while he was able to puncture it, seems pretty sturdy.  I know that if we just played tug and toss with it the rope would still be on it.  However, Or pup often likes to run into the middle of the front yard and lay down and have at it.",3
I wanted to get a very handsome leash for our dog to go with the custom embossed leather collar we got her (she is spoiled). This one definitely fits the bill. It is very sturdy (she pulls a lot especially when there are squirrels). It is also very comfortable in the hand compared with nylon leashes; there isn't any fear of burning or cutting. We've met other dog owners with this leash as well and everyone seems to love it. We also found the price to be very reasonable!,5
My animals (cat & dog) share a water bowl and they didn't like it. I started to notice they were drinking less water so I stopped using it after about 1week.,1
Attractant doesn't work,2
A+,5
"There is nothing my dog hates more than bath time.  To calm her down afterwards, I like to give her something to chew on, the longer it takes her to finish, the better.  So after her latest bath time, I presented this bone to her right after I took her out of the bath.  She snatched it right from my hand with any hesitation and took it away to the hallway (her favorite post bath chewing spot). and went at it.  The bone was pretty easy for her to chew and it lasted about thirty minutes before she was up walking around without any trace of it last.  Which is just enough time to distract that she just had a bath.",5
Perfect for dogs that have digestive issues,5
Bought these because my two cats started with the hair ball nastiness!  My very finicky cat just sniffed them at first.  I think my non finicky cat ate them the first couple days.  I only gave three each because package said up to 6 a day if I remember correctly.  Well Ms. finicky loves them now.  Shell sit and wait for them.  Ms. Non finicky has medium length hair and the first couple days after eating these she threw up hair balls.  Ugh!  Then Ms. Finicky did once.  Ugh again!  BUT they have not thrown up any in almost two weeks.  I feed both cats three a day.,5
Really bummed about this. It did not stay put and it's useless to me now. I am not going to drill into my window sill.,1
"I read several reviews that said that it was cheaply made. I don't think so. I pulled and yanked on that thing. If I can dislodge it it's not coming out. Clips right into the seat belt. People complaining about their dogs chewing through it., what do you want? Teach your dog some obedience, or maybe the meaning of no? Dogs will bite on new things that are restraining them, the material is perfectly suitable it's not meant to be a chew toy.",5
"Good sturdy scoop.  Haven't been able to overload or bend this scoop with some of the butt bombs my pets have dropped.  Even with fresh wet litter, this scoop holds up.",5
This actually works just like it says.  Vet has been giving me meds and put my cat to sleep to clean her ears.  This worked.  Have to use it a few days to see results.,5
"I am happy that I bought this on amazon for my cat because the pet stores are double on price, it came fast and saved time and money.  This is the second time I ordered the frontline on this site.  My cat has no problems and it seems to work well.",5
works well,4
"This is so cute, really well made and big enough to hold a lot of toys. I am very happy I got this",5
The kitties love this treat. It was recommended to me by a good friend...and it has not disappointed!,5
Good bulb for viewing but gets pretty hot. I also have it in a ceramic lamp holder which does not help. The light emitted is awesome.,3
my dog loves these,5
"This is the perfect heater for my 2.2 gallon Mr. Aqua tank.  Keeps my tank at 78 degrees in a room that is barely over 60.  I live in North Dakota in a converted cabin so I was afraid it would not be able to maintain heat.  It does and well.  I have it set on the dial for ""79"" degrees but it holds the tank at 76 to 79 degrees depending on if my room heater is on or not.  Small footprint and easy to hide in my small tank.  Light comes on when it's heating.",5
Seems to work better then the other product I was using as I am giving him less.  Jack Russell mix.  He seems more focused when he gets them.  I tried for a few days not giving him anything and he was way more hyper then when he gets these once a day.,5
"I love it as a product, but it was WAY too big for our pup Chihuahua. Hoping he will grow into it. . . 2 lbs now. He does look snuggly in it though!",3
"I love this.  Adorable.  Very well designed because it protects your dog's chest in addition to the back.  The underbelly Velcro straps were a little too far back, so it I cut them off and resewed them closer to the front.  Very easy fix.",5
"Swam to help my pet with her bad leg, just wish it wasn't so expensive",5
Dog likes them MADE IN USA,5
My cats loved this product. Will buy again. It is also cheaper than I've found in stores.,5
DON'T LAST LONG ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE,3
"These are adorable. I actually got them for my 2 big dogs. They love the little toys and prance around with them.
Most of the time they don't destroy their toys, so I don't know how they hold up with chewers. They've had them for 3 days now and every night I find them on my pillow. It's like they're bringing me a prize. As long as they're happy, I'm happy!!",5
My 3 pups love this...I give them a teaspoon at each meal.  They eat there kibble better and its great for their tummies!,5
Love this harness.  We have one for each dog.  They don't rub or chafe them.  Sturdy and go on and off so easily.,5
"My cat is wise to my desire to slip him a pill periodically and is usually not having it, however, he loves this ""treat"" so much he doesn't know there is a pill in it!  This saved us!",5
"I expected it to be more plush. Unfortunately, it's way too thin. Very soft though",3
"This does not work, I tried under a light and it never glows?",1
"All three of my doggies liked this treat.  It is just the right size, not too tiny, not too large.  I like that this treat will also help their coat and is good for their health.",5
This shampoo is really good. It foams up super quick and gets dirt off my poodle's coat super quick. I have used many dog shampoos before and I will use this one from now on. Love it!,5
Its cute and he seems comfortable with it on.,5
"This is a great bed!  My 30 lb. Beagle hopped on it immediately and settled down for a nice rest.  In fact, he is happily snoozing as I write this.  I bought the American Kennel Club dog blanket in dark brown and draped it over the bed for added comfort, and it looks more comfy than my bed now!  My dog is very destructive and managed to leave tooth marks on one corner, but at least the company offers to send replacement parts up to a year from purchase.  If he destroys this ""chewproof"" bed, I will write an update.  For as long as it lasts, however, my dog and I are both very happy with this bed.

After about a week, I have come back to edit this review to add that my dog is sleeping much better now than he did with his old bed.  He used to get up several times throughout the night to move to different locations (the couch, his window perch, the floor, and back to his bed) but now he sleeps the whole night through on his Kuranda bed.  It makes me feel better knowing that he's getting a good night's sleep.",5
"So far, so good. Has been lasting through the winter, and it's kept outdoors. I like this jaw type scoop the best for lawn and gravel pickup.",5
"My two new kitties love this!  So far, it has saved my furniture from being scratched up.  The literally climb up the sisal poles with their claws and run back down.  They sleep on the platforms and play hide and seek.  This is the first kitty condo I have owned and I would highly recommend.  The quality is great and it is fairly easy to assemble.  Keep the allen wrench it comes with, I have had tighten it up because they play so vivaciously on this thing.",5
Durable and great size,4
Cute.,5
"The ""old stand-by"" dog toy.  A few treats inside and a dab of peanut butter to slow down their release from the Kong and the pup is entertained for a good while!",5
"I like to use this collar with my dog when we're hiking so I can keep him from running off after animals but still allow him to run around.  This is the second collar I've purchased from PetSafe, the first having stopped working after 2 years.  The new collar worked well for about 5 months then died.  PetSafe sent a replacement (several weeks after I notified them of the problem) which didn't work at all.  It's a great idea for a product but they seem to have quality issues which will prevent me from buying any products from them in the future, especially since it takes so long to get help and replacements from them.",2
"As described, quality product.  The twisted ropes inside are good for gnawing.  Fur is secure and good quality",5
Very nice item.  Love it.,5
If your dogs mess your carpet ... Use this!,5
Great little cordless trimmer for doing small areas -- not for doing the entire coat.  I use to keep the hair out of my terriers ears --- to keep air-flow present and prevent ear infections.  Also tender undersides that I don't hand-strip.,5
"The price fluctuates so much, I can't do Subscribe & Save.  Last S&S delivery, I paid $19.92 per case, now it's $16.26, so S&S did NOT save me money :-(

HOWEVER, My boy loves it and cleans his dish! The dish is stainless steel and I can see my face in the dish when he finishes up!",4
"I had this unit on my 55gal tank for about 5 months.  I started smelling rubber burning and found the cord, just where it entered the tank was melting and smoking.  I am glad no one got an unexpected electrical shock!!",4
My dog loves these. Rarely can she break down the bone,5
"I've been using dog pads for years and these are by far the best made. Not sure anyone needs a pad this well made, but they are 3 times stronger than the other pads I've been using. I can buy 200 of the cheap pads for what they charge for 150 of these. Guess you will just have to try these and decide for yourself. These Wee Wee pads are super heavy duty. Haven't decided if I will buy these again or go back to the cheaper ones.",5
"It's been a difficult road to get my girl to tolerate this collar because she doesn't like it on her nose, but the resources given for this product to help fasten this correctly and use it right are great! My samoyed is a sled dog who loves to pull and this collar is great in order to keep control of my dog and to keep from having to use a prong collar. Would give it 5 stars if my dog would have hated the part around her nose so much, but hey, what can you do!?",4
Nice color. Also strong and durable.,5
"my puppy loves these! and she looks so cute and proud when she holds it in her mouth and the goose is limp. they are a decent size as far as length goes. they don't have any weird 'factory/chemical' smells. they have a squeaker in the head and in the butt so its great for play time no matter which end you are tugging at. although my puppy is teething i wouldn't consider her a 'destructive' teether, she hasn't destroyed other toys of hers. but we have certainly gotten our moneys worth, they have lasted well so far and seem to be made pretty well. i got the goose and the duck, as soon as i pulled them out of the box it was instant love!",5
"I really like this product, good quality durable construction.  Amazing thing is, that ever since the day I got this, I have not seen another ant around!  I have no doubt that the water moat will stop them in the future when the pests return again.  This has been the worst year for ants outside that I have ever seen.  While this product is not inexpensive, it should last for many many years.  Cleans up easily.",5
"I've been using these as training treats because they're easy to snap into smaller pieces on the fly. My dogs seem to be enjoying them. Would recommend. I appreciate that these are offered in a flavor besides chicken, beef, or pork as one of my dogs has some food sensitivities.",4
My Persian gets along fine with this treatment.,5
gotta  have play toys,5
This supplier offers a great price. I switched to this litter system a couple of years ago and love it. Buying from Amazon has made it so much easier since these products are often hard to find in local retail stores.  I have 3 cats so this system has been a wonderful product for me and has reduced litter smell tremendously. Buying them in bulk saves me a ton of money. So convenient also if you are a Prime member and get them shipped free straight to your home.,5
I have 4 cats and two breeze litterboxes. These pads last me about 3-4 days each but it definitely is worth the money! I'm glad I found these. Saves me a decent amount of money,5
"I've purchased two of these in black for our 9 pound Maltese.
It looks like a lap top, so it truly is discreet and incognito. Hense the name!
 It has plenty of windows, both sides, top for your pets viewing pleasure. They all have either zippored closures or the top has a flap with Velcro.
It has a full opening on one side.
This is a very clever and a very well made bag indeed.
It can be carried with the shorter double straps or the adjustable, removable long shoulder strap.
It is lightweight too.
I would buy this again and again and highly recommend it.
It's also airline approved.
You can purchase extra inside pads at sturdi.com or just check out the other sturdi carriers and pet supplies.",5
"My dog ripped through this cage in a matter of days. The whole top left corner is gone as well as the wire on the front gate making it almost impossible to open and close the cage. She's only 37 pounds of pitbull mix. I hope this cage ends up working for someone else but for my Hulk dog, it is almost impossible to keep her contained.",2
This stuff is pretty effective especially if used with POND ZYME SLUDGE DESTROYER... The algaefix kills and loosens the algae and the pond zyme breaks it down so the filters can clean it out... Great product that I recommend and will be ordering again as needed... Thanks for such a great product and making this hobby more enjoyable.,5
Looks nice fits too big for the size recommended for a pug. Sort of looks like a sweater Kanye would design. Fits snug around the chest but oversized by the waist lol. Not too bad,4
"Not ideal for non-shedding dogs.  My shihtzu/poodle mix did not like being brushed with this and it didn't do anything anyway.  This would probably work great on dogs like retrievers, pit bulls, Rottweilers, Labradors, etc.  I'm still giving this five stars because he LOVES to fetch it and it's definitely a favorite toy. It bounces when you throw it and is extremely and surprisingly durable. Ours still looks brand new and we've been using it as a toy for about 8 months now.",5
Dog's (two of them) now come running when I get the pill pockets out - never a problem getting them to gulp them down!!,5
"When I adopted my little Chi-weenie dog 4 months ago, I ordered this 100-ct pack.  I am almost through the whole bag so I will be reordering.  These are just the right size for a small dog or a puppy.  Because I live in an apartment, I like the backup emergency potty stop they provide.  If it's raining and we can't go out, I know she'll use the potty pad. Each pad is 22x22.  I like the fact that they have blue backing so if I glance down the hall, I can quickly tell if I need to change it.  Then I just fold it over a couple of times and roll it up for disposal in the trash.  I have never noticed any odor from these after they've been used either.  I'm satisfied with my purchase.",5
Great sweater,5
"We live with a great deal of fuzz, having two long hair cats plus a small long haired dog. Our Ragdolls are not allowed outside where they might have some of their loose fur wiped against bushes and such. Instead, it has been very difficult to keep up with the hair around the house and has lead to the real problem - hairballs. However, the cats have never liked being combed or brushed. And one of my boys has never been able to tolerate those anti-hairball cat foods for long.

I found this brush mentioned on a grooming-your-Ragdoll website and decided to try it. Wow! One of my boys enjoys this brush so much he scolds me if I stop! He just loves being stroked with this brush and rolls over so I can get the other side and his tummy. The other Ragdoll does very well with it as well and I discovered it makes a nice finishing brush for the dog too. The best part is not getting my fingers poked trying to clean all that fine hair out of the tines. The photo does not help you see it, but behind the brush is a nice wide button that lifts the whole front surface of the brush level with the end of the tines, so you just wipe the hare off the surface and then it retracts when you let go- super easy. The handle is comfortable and curved well for your grip.",5
Killed bryopsis within 2 weeks of Mg at 2000+ppm,5
"The pet pen is a great item, easy to assemble and very handy. My tiny Westie puppy figured how to climb out of it on the second day, so now I have a very slightly used pen to sell.  We should have named her Houdini.",4
"I browsed the reviews,like many people, I don,t know how to make the lock works!
Maybe we need the Vedic commentary!!",4
loved it my 4lb dog is always on it,5
"My cats are addicted to this, even the picky one. Glad to be able to get a 6-pack for a totally fine price.",5
Finally something my pit/shepherd can't destroy in 10 minutes. He LOVES this ball.,5
Happy with purchase!,4
Fits nice on a Medium Shih Tzu's head.  Cute for a cowboy costume.,5
"My Jack Russells LOVE Kong products, but only the medium Kong Extreme is tough enough for these guys. They are super durable. We got the large once, and because the bottom hole is bigger, one of our dogs was able to get a better angle for chewing, and he tore bits off of the bottom. But the medium is just their size. This toy is at least $10 in a chain pet store on a good day, but I was able to get one here on Amazon.com shipped to me for under $9.",5
"This crate is perfect for my 60 pound Doberman Pinscher. She has plenty of leg room when laying down and can stand comfortably. Two doors and the divider are a plus! I chose this crate because of the high reviews and the great price. The icrate was also a good price but I chose this one over the icrate because it is made of a heavier metal. I've had my  Doberman since she was 8 weeks old and she is crate trained but I wanted the stronger crate just in case she got a little wild in there while I was gone. I can easily fold and put up the create when needed so I'm very please with the deal that I got and the quality product that I have. When possible, call the manufacturing company and get details about their product. Midwest Life Stages was very helpful! The Amazon price sealed the deal. We are both happy pups over here!",5
Not good for active small dogs,3
"My hairless rat enjoys these as a treat. They are a little harder than some of the treats, so it gives him a chance to chew on something.",5
its to early to see if it is helping my cat. but they do have a very strong order to them,3
Works good,5
BAD IDEA FOR MY PET TIPS COME OFF TO EASY,1
"Once I could get it on her, not a device problem, a dog problem, lolllll it fit just great and works well for controlling her.  It's a great walking device, also.  Haven't used it with the seat belts yet but feel it, too, will work well.  Quality of product seems just fine, good stitching at the critical points.  Product was delivered timely.",4
Great scent. Even the dogs like to have it sprayed on them,5
"Initially there were no problems with this dog food. After my dog has been on it for 3-4 months, she has definitely developed allergies I have never seen before on her. Her chest area is full of rashes, she is losing patches of fur, her skin is flaking, red and itchy. The smell of her body is horrible. I have to constantly bathe her. I'm switching to homemade grain free dog food and I will see if her symptoms change, if it does, then it was definitely this food.

Also, ever since she started this dog food, her stool is in much larger quantities compared to other food she has eaten. That gives me reason to believe the carb ratio is very high in this formula.

It may work for your dog, but it definitely did not on mine.",2
the nutritional quality of the food is amazing and is so worth the money especially my small 5lb dog doesnt eat that much. wish they had small bits for smaller dogs like blue buffalo has.,5
she comes out of the legs. They don't hold her snug enough.l,3
Love these adjustable poles. They are very well made and solid.,5
"WHY is this item labeled LARGE when it fits my shih-tzu who weighs about 15 pounds? This was ordered for my cairn terrier who does not like the standard harness and ends up hoarse if only his collar is used.

One customer said these were a bit small, but for a 20-pound terrier, why do I need to buy an extra-large? The buckles / 'D' rings would not touch each other, and the velcro fastener would not touch the other piece around his shoulders.",2
This is a really durable product.  Not very easy to clean when there is poop on it but is very secure for baby chicks.,4
seems to work but it bothers my cat so I stopped using them. I just grabbed her by the neck when I need her to be still. She doesn't mind that so much,3
"I very much like being able to purchase high quality Cat food from sitting at my desk, having it arrive and cart it home without having to travel to pet store ...plus its a bit less expensive.",5
"Our kitty is an Olympiannapper. But we can get her to play with these sometimes. I store them in a bag of loose catnip to heighten the appeal. Initially, I roll one across the floor in front of her, but she'll play on her own with it afterward, putting her paw through the center or holding one side down while she rips away at the other like the vicious predator she is, somewhere in there. The toy is extremely durable and has survived claws, teeth, and a lot of kitty drool.",5
"Purchased the crate they recommended for Great Danes, however, later on found out that Great Danes require the next size up from the recommended size on here... It'll be okay for the next 2 months, but beware.",3
"this stuff is great! after researching which essential oils to use, i made my own spray. then i found this wipe.the only downside is that you really have to saturate down to the animals skin. but the smell isn't bad and this was the only thing that handled the fleas after months and money of trying different topical ointments. my plan moving forward is to alternate this wipe in between months of actyvl topical.",5
"we have a few of these rugs by our sliding glass doors in our house and we love them! when you have 3 big dogs who constantly go in and out this thing saves me from having to constantly clean or wipe my floors! it collects a ton of water off their paws, as well as dirt and mud and grass and whatever else those crazy animals decide to bring in! on top of it, it is super easy to clean! i just shake it out and everything comes out and i throw it in the wash every couple of weeks to really get it clean! highly recommend this rug! also its a great bird watching mat for kitties cause it seems to be super comfortable for them!",5
My cat loves this and no more diarrhea!,5
"My dogs love squeak toys, I bought this for my 5 month old Aussie pup, she looooves it! Its not a sturdy toy but it's great for dogs that don't destroy toys. The squeakers still kind of work after a month or so but not as well. Good but for the money for a pup to carry around.",5
Cute cow. Got chewed up almost immediately.,3
"My dog, for whatever reason, does not like this. He's very picky however and only wants to eat chicken which is why I bought in the first place. We rescued him from a puppy mill so I've no idea why a dog in that situation would be so particular about food. If I heat up the chicken and mix it in so he can't taste it that works. It's a good idea but in my situation it's not really effective.",2
Great Hide-Out for baby fishes.  I use this on my 5 gallon guppy tank and I saved a lot of baby guppies.  It works great!,5
"We've owned this for about a year now, purchased because we had to separate some finches that didn't get along. We purchased this cage as the second cage and functionally it works, however it is very loud compared to our other cages. When the birds fly from one branch to another the entire cage will rattle and shake all the perches. We had to add foam to the bottom of cage to insulate it from the table it sits on because it was shaking the table too.

The culprit might be the lack of strength in the cage structure. There are small plastic attachment pieces you install between the metal cage sides. The cage sides do not actually touch, there is no metal superstructure. What you have is plastic holding metal together. It's very flimsy and this is one of its drawbacks.

If you have one bird that does not move a lot and you don't spend much time around the cage you probably would not have problems with this unit. But if you spend time araound the cage and there is more than one bird, you might find it annoying like us.",3
Good brush for thick coat on pommeriam.,5
I use this for my dog's coat that was very dry and my cat's constipation.  Great product.  Pets love the taste.,5
"I have 4 cats and 1 small dog who all love this!!!  It's high-quality materials and construction and I haven't noticed any difference in my electric bills even though it's almost always in use by one or more of my cats or service dog.  I have a 10-pound Italian Greyhound Mix Psychiatric Service Dog for PTSD and he and my cats all love it.  My dog doesn't have any body-fat, so he enjoys it for the extra warmth.  I live near the beach in San Diego, so it doesn't really get cold here (I'm from Minnesota where we have real weather!  ha ha ha).  It uses very little electricity since it is low-voltage and it only turns on when my cats or dog sit on it, and it only heats exactly where their body puts pressure on it.  Wow!  Great technology, low energy, and even the cord is animal-proof from chewing since it is wrapped with metal like a slinky (only stronger metal).  One of my cats likes to chew on cords and other items, so this prevents her from chewing on it.  My boyfriend also bought one for his cat from this same company due to the high quality of the product and he's very picky about quality; his cat loves it, too!  I highly recommended this amazing product!!!  There are also smaller and larger sizes available, but I got one a little bigger so that more than one animal could use it at the same time.  I've had 3 cats sharing it at the same time which is sooooo cute!  I'll have to add photos in the future!",5
"I have a pom/long-haired chihuahua mix and these shears are great for his thick fur (I use it for his fur around the bottom and feet, mostly). Definitely recommend. They're sharp yet have the curved tip, so safe too!",5
Not happy only took puppy 5 mins to destroy,1
Awesome toy for outside..hours of fun and durability for the dogs to play with....lots of back yard fun! they love it!!,5
I like it but it slides a lot. I was able to add a strap to go under the seat that holds a bit better. fits well in my mazda hatchback.,4
Works great on pet urine odor.,5
great,5
"The first thing you're going to notice about this 40-pound box of Arm & Hammer Platinum Clump & Seal is that it is very heavy, and, because of that, not exactly easy to pour into the kitty litter container, at least when the box is full. This is just a rectangular box, so pouring the kitty litter is not as easy as pouring kitty litter in a more compact, plastic container that has a more prominent handle. Thank goodness it has a sturdy handle.

That's the bad part. The good elements of this kitty litter for different types of cats is that our cat took right to it, and even better, it really does cover up bad odors when compared to other types of kitty litter we've used. It's got a Clump & Seal Fresh Scent promise that supposedly eliminates 10 percent of odors, and I believe that claim. Army & Hammer has a patented blend ""of moisture-activated Micro-Granules"" that ""forms an odor-containing seal."" This Clump & Seal guarantee lasts seven days.

Additionally, this kitty litter is less dusty than other types we've used, which my wife and I definitely noticed. At the same time, it's also much finer and less pebbly than other kitty litter brands we've purchased. When scooping up the messes, this kitty litter produces more clumps and less crumbles than usual. We think our cat prefers the fine consistency of the litter, and scooping up the clumps is easier for us.

Baking soda is an ingredient in this kitty litter, and brief direction are included on the side of the box. The opening section to pour the kitty litter is nothing more than a hole in the side of the box, but there is a tab that you can notch over it to keep it covered.

Arm & Hammer is a reputable company, and we've found this kitty litter to be above average for our cat. The biggest thing lacking about the product, by far, is the non-ergonomic box. Still, it's worth the hassle because this is good stuff.",4
Best crunchy non-chicken treat,5
Cats love em!,5
"Smells like fish. But my dog likes it.

So do my cats, though I wish they wouldn't eat it.",3
"Arrived promptly, work perfectly. Thank you!",5
"Our puppy, unfortunately, is not bothered by this.  It is certainly bitter, as we have gotten a taste of it - but nothing bothers our puppy when he wants to chew on something.",3
"This is inexpensive and presumably nutritious since it's Purina. I buy it to fee the feral cats in my neighborhood. One of them approached me persistently, meowing to be fed. When I fed her, she brought some friends.",5
"It seems a lot smaller than it should be, I guess the one I saw in the store was an extra large because this things is about the same size as my small floating dock.",3
Timer does not work and so far no one has learned to turn it on except me.,2
My cat really loves this; super entertaining.,5
It's a good idea but Premier (which usually makes fairly reliable products) really did not do a good job with this one. The sound made by the clicker was quiet and did not produce a crisp sound. The sound seemed to get quieter over time and then just died out - probably all before 100 clicks. I even tried to fix it by taking it apart and bending the metal piece but no such luck. Very disappointed.,1
"My puppy likes these for a minute or two, but likes them a lot more when I stick them in the freezer for a while. I think the cold feels good since she's teething :)",5
Great size bowls for my 90 lbs American Pit bull Terrier. I love that he doesn't have to strain his neck to get to his water or food. He seems to enjoy it too. The only con is that it makes a huge mess. Still looking for a bog enough mat to place underneath and help with that- but the bowls and stand itself it FANTASTIC!,5
"As other reviewers have said, these smell awful and made both of my dogs sick. 65 lb labradoodle and 25 lb shichon bothers vomited a ton after I gave them these. Wouldnt buy again.",1
It was great for about an hour with my power chewer. I have a 8 month old lab male lab. He had the fabric ripped within about 20 minutes and the entire thing destroyed within an hour. He had a great time in that hour though.,3
Good,4
Best poop bags I have ever purchased. I will never buy another kind.,5
Been giving my dogs these for 20 years and they never had skin problems and I think these help with insects also.  Would highly recommend!,5
My Shepherd loves this bed!!,5
"VERY DANGEROUS FILTER, I have 2 of these and each filter has caught the oranda goldfish tail and sucked them in, these were big fish . I came home to find them dead!!!! It took 2 years to grow these fish, very sad,",1
"Our dog enjoys this brand and there are no crumbs or waste at the bottom like cheap brands.  We feed less than recommended as i think 'recommended"" on all brands is to get you to buy more frequently. She is healthy and happy.",5
"I really buy these toys more for the ball than the squeaker. Regular green tennis balls tend to get lost in my yard and mowed over. My dogs have mauled them enough that they don't squeak anymore but they still work great as a ball. My three dogs are all a bit over 60 pounds, so smaller dogs would probably not destroy them as easily",4
"I have a small 7lb chihuahua and shes usually xs. I ordered this because it looks super cute, and once i got it and tried it on my little one, it didn't fit. Bummer!!! So, i tried it on my yorkie which is 4-5lbs and it fits way better on her. So make sure uou read the sizes and measure your dog before ordering. The shipping and delivery was fast!",2
"The pet grooming kit came right away, nicely packaged and nothing damaged.  I immediately started using the pet kit on my little dog. Everything I needed was in the kit.  I like the fact that it comes in a carrying case, everything is organized in it's place and not all over.  I just use it! Zip the bag! Toss it in a drawer and ready for next time.",5
"Recommended by my Vet for our pet's allergies.  Not sure it helps but our schnauzer loves it.  Also, the smell (to a human) when opening and serving is much more appealing than other brands of dog food, which sometimes have an offensive odor.",5
"I did a lot of research and tried two other strollers before buying this one--it's a keeper!  It saved the day after my dog tore his ACL knee ligament, and during the healing period after surgery.  It's a very smooth ride and--easy to push the stroller and hold the leash so your dog can walk a little then, you can load him into the stroller to extend his time outdoors beyond his physical limitation.  The no-zip feature is fantastic though we didn't close the top very often as Murphy likes the wind in his ears :-)  It's large and was a bit of a challenge lifting it into the back of my SUV but I got better with practice and the stroller came in handy for Vet visits. It has two leash straps - meant for two small dogs but I used both straps on my 35 lb dog to keep him well secured (one on either side of his collar).  Expensive stroller but worth every penny.",5
Both my dogs tried it and don't like it.,3
This is a great little harness for smaller dogs.  I got the medium for my 14 pound Dachs-Min Pin X and it fits perfectly and so far it looks like good quality.,5
"It works, the material is ludicrously thin and flimsy.",3
"I have a Samoyed who's fur knots below his ears where he scratches and his collar will sometimes catch.  When my dog will sit still for me to work on them, this works great.  It was recommended by our groomer who uses it in her business.",5
I have never understood how and why you would need to buy a new poop bag dispenser but they are all made out of cheap plastic and they break off the leash or the lid cracks and can no longer screw back on - i love that someone came up with one that snaps on!!!!! and you change the bags with a velcro closure...I hope this one lasts longer than the plastic ones! It works just as any plastic bag dispenser and it is light weight on the leash. I recommend it!,4
"Very healthy for my Maine Coon; her fur is so soft now! But, she isn't crazy about the taste. She eats less of it than her previous food Taste of the Wild, but her tummy didn't handle Taste of the Wild very well. This is much gentler on her tummy.",4
"Our yellow lab needed a new bowl for outside...he is older, so the height is perfect.",5
"runs large will have to fold up white cuff legs and sew them in place, 8lb Chorkie",4
"My cat loves this toy - there are plenty of feather and strips of metallic ribbon in a nice plump tail. However, the wand itself is so thin that it has bent just from holding it. This would be a really lovely toy if the handle was more substantial, but, as it is, I don't expect it to last much longer before it breaks.",3
"This helps my border collie entertained. BUT my pit (my delicate flower) is so scared of it due to the back swing after she let go, will not go anywhere near it. So if your dog is playful but shy... I really don't recommend it.",4
"After reading other reviews I was concerned.  But the quality is pretty good, set up is cake and it works.  I used it in a 2012 explorer.  I have two medium sized dogs, the are not overly aggressive and are intimidated by the gate so they don't charge it.  If your dog breaks out of the crate or fenced in yard..this is not for you as a big dog will knock it down eventually with some forces.  But for most dogs, this is great.",4
I bought the XS for my 10lb kitten and it fits great. I use it as a back up when I let my cat out so he has an extra set of tags and GPS tracker on him in case he loses his collar. Doesn't seem to bother his to wear it and he is used to having it put on. I find the easiest way to get it on is to lie it flat on the ground and put his front paws on the holes and then quickly pull it up. I think the XS will still be ok as he grows bigger.,5
"Already used it on my Labradors teeth. Looks just like the picture. They work great. I have a bigger scraper,too big to work good. This scraper is small and easier to do the dogs teeth and get in the tight areas. I scrape both dogs teeth every month and brush my dogs teeth 2 times sometimes 3 times a week. When brushing my teeth my dogs sit next to me looking like I am next. They like the taste of the poultry/ peanut tasting (dog) toothpaste. Do not use human toothpaste on your dogs,it will make them sick. Also do not give dogs peanut butter. Peanuts ok,not peanut butter. Google it.",5
"This dog food has a strange, bad odor to it. My dogs won't eat it. Other dogs must like it becuase Merrick is a very successful company, but I won't be buying this again.",1
"I have 2 adult cats who both love these treats. One of my cats will not touch any treats, except for these! He goes crazy for them and runs to me when he sees me reaching for the canister. I've tried offering him a variety of other treats from other brands to no avail. I've even offered him other Friskies flavors and he turns his nose to those also. These are the only treats for him!",5
"This water dispenser is small, even for my two Chihuahuas. But, it does not leak or have any defects. I just recommend that you only get this if you have a small dog. It is not big enough for a dog over 15 pounds.",4
Great heater and can be put horizontally or vertically inside the tank to have in the best position to stay out of the way of whatever you have taking up space in your aquarium.  Mine hangs in the back of my small aquarium vertically and horizontally a week before adding water when it starts getting low.,5
They seem to like the taste of this and I hope that when my rabbit food comes that he likes it too.  I have picky critters so this is great.,4
"I have a 110 pound, 9 month old female Newfoundland who has about 20 pounds or so to go until she's fully mature. She rides in my SUV to day care, the vet, the groomer and many other places. I needed something like this to save my back and her developing joints.

This ramp is perfection. It is very light (I can lift it with one hand), folds in half, supports the weight of my girl without any evident undue strain and the rough surface offers some increased grip. It does get scratched up, but who cares? It's a ramp for crying out loud, not a dining table (this was a complaint of some preceding reviewers. I kid you not.). One bonus is that it does clean up nicely. All you need is a hose and some sort of brush and almost anything will come off of it, (think hardened drool and mud) even on the rough walking surface.

The cargo area of my SUV is quite high off of the ground so it's a bit steep when propped. She'll be fine in her youth with this ramp, but when she starts getting up there in years I may have to find a different method of loading her as she will be so massive as an adult and Newfs frequently have orthopedic issues, especially as they age. If you have an aging Newfie or Saint Bernard coupled with an SUV, I would recommend finding another ramp or purchasing this along with a van with a lower point of entry :)

Although a telescoping ramp may be more space efficient, I would still highly recommend this to anyone with a giant or large breed dog or a smaller, arthritic dog.",5
Great product for the money.,5
My three furry friends love these treats and know exactly where I keep the container.  This is an outstanding value for the price.,5
We took in 5 kittens just before it started getting cold in Minnesota.  The kitties love it and snuggle up all together after being put in the house for just the first time.,5
"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.

She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique, and I decided to give it a try.

After about a month of use, I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However, when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.

She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget, she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly, Darby did not skip.

This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.

I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit, Angel, because he was worried about her mobility issues.

I thought if it worked for Darby, surely it would also work for Angel.",5
"My dog loves him! We didn't even realize it was a squeaky toy, but it doesn't matter cause the squeaker barely works anyway so I'm just gonna pretend it's not. It's held up really well during tug of war so far! Excited to see how long it'll last. Thanks.",5
"we started noticing some damage to our laminate pergo flooring in the kitchen under the dog bowls, so i ordered this mat to contain the water drips. does its job and is a good size for my westie and her small-ish bowls. the slight lip around the edge contains the little bit of water that normally seeps. works great for us!",5
"Love this doggie deodorant. It works really well. I don't use it on her every day, but I will spray her down when I know company is on the way over. She's not a stinky dog, but she's a dog, and sometimes they smell like dogs, especially to people who don't have one of their own. This smells great and isn't overly strong, doesn't linger too long either. Sprayer sprays in a great mist.",5
My dog LOVES this food.  She is such a picky eater & will practical inhale these dinner patties.,5
"well,  I don't love it,  but my puppy surely does.  We have bought lots of chew toys to no avail  - he still prefers shoes and Tupperware.  However this one is different, he actually takes it out of his toy bowl and plays with it all by himself,  and if we offer it to him, he takes it happily.  I don't know why this bone is different from all the others,  but this one is definitely a favorite.  He's been gnawing on it for maybe 3 weeks now and it's still in good shape - so he likes it and it has some longevity.  I call that a win!",5
Both my cats love these and I was glad to get them in such a large amount.,5
We used this for our cat on a trip. It works great for us. I used it one night during a storm my cat was upset. He calmed right down. On the trip i.sprayed once inside his pet crate/taxi and it helped tremendously. I didn't want to sedate him so I tried this. It's a very good alternative to sedation for traveling with your cat.,5
"This is a great product. I can keep doors open for my cat while keeping out my dogs. The first one held up so well I bought another, and will probably buy more.

Very simply installed and subtle on the door.",5
"My dogs in Mexico love them. I bring a few bags of them down for their ""Treat Time"".",5
"I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Its such a pain for me to have to buy a bulky pump and than a separate bubbler but this thing is all combined into one! I love the overall look it has and how it sticks to the tank as well. The bubbles are smaller compared to other pumps I have had in the past but it gets the job done. Now for the sound, pretty quiet but as I expected no completely silent.
 I would definitely purchase this product again.",5
love these collars,5
Great product with speedy delivery,5
Really surprised how awesome this product is. Works perfectly. I have 6 dogs. Now staying off my couch. Love how easy it works. And high pitch sound is way better then shocked. Highly recommend.,5
"Does not work as advertised.  I started with two new filters, vacuumed the tank two times, cleaned the filters every day, added the solution every day and it took two weeks to clear up.  Don't be fooled by the name on the company with US in the name as it comes from France and takes several weeks to get.  I do not recommend this product.",3
Dog loves them,5
"Changing the attachments is really hard, I managed to do it once, but haven't been able to do it again.

Worse, however, is that the metal scraper seems as if the middle is higher than the edges. I don't see how that can be the case, but the middle of the scraper doesn't scrap off algae. At first when all the algae is fairly high, given I hadn't scraped in awhile, it scraped off a lot of algae. But, it left huge patches of thin green algae and try as hard as I can, I can't get this to scrap it off unless it use the point at either end.

I've ordered a different scraper. I'm not going to try to return this one because I didn't test it to see if light comes through at the middle... Though, I think it would.",2
All four of our dogs love playing with these! Really good product at good price.,5
"I've been giving these to my 2 cats for about a year and they would gobble them up like they were treats.  I'm afraid my long hair cat will have hair ball problems like my previous cat so want to nip that in the bud.  So I would give them 2 about every other day.  I received a new bottle today and strangely both cats sniffed, licked and walked away!  Previously they have never refused these so I don't know what gives.  Change in formula?  I'd take a look at it before I'd order another bottle. Disappointed.",2
"It really glows bright and has a nice bounce, we only use it outdoors and I won't let him play with it inside the house. He has so many other balls to entertain himself with once we inside and I don't want him to tear this one up yet.",5
My little dog loved this toy but ripped off the arms and tore the whole thing up within two days.,3
"Well, I bought this for my cat who always throws up exactly as soon as we get off of the highway on our 3 hour trip from college to home. This didn't help with the throwing up but she did seem calmer.",4
I hate collars on a dog. The halter is comfortable and does not pull from a lead.  We go in the river and it quickly dries so she is not uncomfortable.  Maxx gives it a big paws up.  She will go get her halter and demand to go for a walk.  How easy can it be ?,5
Thank you,5
Our cat loves this food. However he has not lost any weight.,5
"Prior to buying 2 of these bowls I used large plastic bowls which eventually got brittle in the sun and broke apart. These bowls are well made, an excellent size for any size dog, and will last for a long time. They are easy to clean and very attractive.",5
My yorkie has lots of fun. Enough said.,5
Only had it for 5 months and the lights are already going out. I ordered the pink collar and it was great but it doesn't hold a charge very well and now only two bulbs are flickering.,2
"I bought the replacements filters when I bought the fountain, so I keep them until needed. This is a good filter, the water in the fountain is clean for a few days, even if I have six cats drinking from it.",5
"I am a loyal customer and have these on automatic shipment. They are fun, healthy and the dogs gobble them up, leaving no crumbs!",5
Dogs loved it,5
My dog loves Lambchop so much that I had to order another one.,5
Cats Love it. it saved my couch,5
Toby our Dog is happy,5
Cats love it!  They always appreciate something different than dry food and even prefer this over other wet brands.,5
works great,5
"Any food from The Honest Kitchen is premium, in my opinion.  I encourage anyone who cares about their dog to check into the various Honest Kitchen offerings to find the one they think their pooch will like the best.  Mine likes every one he has been offered.",5
meets expecations,4
great,4
"Repeat buy, very satisfied",5
ALL my cats like this food...and I normally can't say that! No menadione bisulfite complex (also known as synthetic Vitamin K) in this formula either.,5
"My 2 cats love this stuff, they go cray-cray over can food.",5
"The quality of the construction is good, but I returned it because of one flaw: the non-slip surface. It is basically just sandpaper glued onto the deck. One slip and your dog will have bloody feet. At least they could have put down a strip of something softer, like rubber, or even outdoor carpeting. But sandpaper? Ouch waiting to happen. And my dog did NOT like walking on that surface at all.",3
nice,3
This is a little heavy for a little dog..our furbaby tries to bring it back when we toss it but has a hard time..plus she doesn't like the taste of the rubber..she will chew the nose..if you kept the rubber ball out of the midsection would have been a ten..my mistake i didn't read that there was a rubber ball in the mid section..,3
My large breed dog loves this brand (Starmark) toys!  He has not been able to chew through the toys thus far which is very important and he loves the treats.  This toy keeps him busy for days at a time.,5
This harness fits well and is easy to put on the dog. What it doesn't have is a swivel where you connect the leash. When the dog steps over the leash the harness is unforgiving and creates stess on the dogs under arms. I have gone back to a basic cinch choker as it allows the dog more freedom.,3
Fish love it,5
"This is the only Blue Buffalo food I feed my kitten.  Mainly because its the only one in their line without caregeenan. Their chicken and Salmon also doesn't include it but I only feed that one a few times a month because of the fish.
I'm disappointed they've added caregeenan to the rest of their line.  My kitty loves this one though.",5
"Both of my dogs had severe diarrhea within a few days of starting Glandex.  Nothing else in their diet was different or could have caused that.  Stopped the Glandex and they are back to normal, though 1 is still scooting.....  Think they are better off with canned pumpkin.",2
Ok light for the price,3
"I sent my diabetic cat into remission with this product. When my cat turned up diabetic, I started doing some research. Turns out dry food is WAY too high in carbs for cats. My vet put my cat on insulin shots twice a day.  I knew there had to be a way to control the diabetes with diet and I was right. Low carb wet cat food!! And it turns out the best wet food for diabetic cats are the grocery store brands, yep Fancy Feast Pate'. I use this feeder to make sure my cat never goes too long without eating.  The ice packs ensure that the food stayed relatively fresh. I set one timer for 4 hours and the other for 8 hours.  Now I can go to the gym after work and not worry about my kitty's blood sugar going too low.  Within ONE
month of switching to wet cat food feedings, he was off insulin and in remission!",5
"This life jacket, while absolutely adorable, does not provide additional buoyancy for our pomeranian. We bought the jacket because he is having knee surgery on BOTH back legs and we wanted to facilitate his recovery with some aqua therapy (once his stitches are removed). Prior to the surgery, we alternated having him swim with and without the jacket on. He rides just as low in the water and has to work just as hard to stay afloat with and without the jacket. I may alter it using pieces of swim noodle on the sides, as I want the dog to be able to basically float, kicking only to propel himself, not keep himself above water. Additionally, the velcro on the straps tangles HORRIBLY in his hair. He is a pom and has lots of it, but he has a teddy bear haircut and his hair is only about one inch long. I'm giving two stars because it seems to be well made and is super cute, but as a life jacket, it falls short for me.",2
"It is constructed well.  A GREAT idea, and I bought this for my cats for outside in the winter, as they have pet doors and love to be outside. BUT, other cats have been using it, and spraying in it, and I had to disinfect it and bring it inside.  It's probably great for a porch or such, or yes, feral cats, but will not work for the reason I bought it.",3
Fast delivery....thank you!  5-Stars,5
"I have tries numerous other dental treats for small dogs and cats and this is by far the best.  At first,  they were not interested because they had never had rawhide before. I squeezed a strip of their enzymatic toothpaste (which they love)  down the length of the chew and they immediately ate it! While harder than greenies (for petite dogs)  and dentastix (also for petite dogs) ,  which they demolish too easily,  they are still chewable enough for them to consume in a few minutes.  They are made of small pieces of rawhide that are pressed together.  I give each cat half of one,  and I am able to break them in half with my hands. I give it to them every other day,  and I have noticed dramatic results in the last 2-3 weeks. If you can get your pet to eat these,  their teeth and gums will thank you!",5
My dog loves this toy. He brings the squirrels everywhere and gets the log stuck on his head all the time. We have alot of dog toys and this is one of the only ones that I haven't had to sew back together with 80lb braid fishing line. It's been about 6 months now and it still looks as new as the day we got it and all the squeakers still work. I would definitely buy this again and would recommend to anyone with a small dog.,5
We have over 200 fish and all of them love this food,5
One my my cats favorite,5
"Showed up, all good... but raspberry should be pinkish not green right? Also it does not second as a toy even if it is ""KONG"".",4
Love the treats for dogs and cats. Sometimes if shipped with other items they break up and crumble and you end up with chicken dust.,4
"So far so good - not destroyed!!!!! Ours didn't look like this picture, it was orange with stars but it is still kicking. fingers crossed.",4
Dog loves 'em!,5
Good product but my dog didn't really like it.,3
"A friend gave us a box of the two flavor sandwich cookies for our dogs as a hostess gift on game night. We are those people - we much prefer a gift for the hounds to a bottle of wine or flowers.

All five of our dogs like these n both flavors and the senior dogs don't seem to have trouble chewing them. The vanilla cookies smell like human cookies to me. I break one in half to split between two dogs and that is plenty. My only concern is the use of soybean oil in these. We have two dogs with soy allergies so they can't eat these or we risk itchy skin.",4
House broke 10 puppies by age 8 weeks. They all went home to their new families house broken.  Love it!,5
"I love my drinkwell, that being said - I have struggled to find a filter that lasts as long as the one ones did years back.  I take great care to clean my filters but this company has changed something, as my filters get slimey in a couple of days.",3
Perfect lot's of play time with my sweet Moe :),5
excellent,5
So many people have recommended this to me - if you have a dog that requires frequent grooming (we have a Goldendoodle) this is immensely helpful for brushing out after a bath. FYI best to use this while the dog is still in a bathtub because it can make your floor surfaces quite slippery.,5
Goes it is a good product. Tested it on myself and gives you a healthy jolt on hte 4th stage of detection. Don't think I will use it on my dog.,3
"The packaging was fine but, the product itself is useless. I have 3 dogs ranging in size from 50 lbs. to 95 lbs. I planned to use this to aid my dogs entering my Ford Edge ground to top of entry is 30"". The ramp angle is far too steep and the ramp is too narrow for the dogs to feel safe to walk up. Additionally, it scratches my car paint where it rest above the bumper. The dogs will not use it, it damages my car paint, it is useless to me. Possibly ok for small dogs but, you could lift them into the car. why would you need it?",1
"I bought this to replace a non-breakaway nylon collar.  We had that because our cat has a sensor to get through the pet door and did not want him to get locked out.  Then I started to worry (not sure why now) that he might get caught on something.  Well, a couple of months after he had this elastic collar, we came downstairs to find him beating on the pet door with no collar.  I was heartbroken.  I scooped up, consoled him, and got his old collar and spare sensor ready for him.  I am not sure there is a solution to this problem, but this does not seem to be it.",3
"Cute, dog mom loved it, dog not so much.",4
Our boys loved it!,5
"I bought this reptile waterer for my hedgehog.  It works really well, doesn't spill, and she seems to like it.  Would recommend.",5
Thank goodness for this product!  We have been using this treatment on our cat for about 10 days now and already have positive results.  The skin is healing and hair is growing back.  I highly recommend this product!,5
This is the perfect addition to my grooming table. Works great to keep the dog standing when you need them too. Universal to all grooming tables. Very good product and fast shipping!,5
I always use Royal Canin puppy food for my pregnant females and to wean the pups.  The pups start on this so easily as opposed to other puppy food.,5
Just wish I could afford to use it more often. I can only buy it when it's on sale. All my dogs (5) love it. Wish there was an app to tell me when there's a discount or coupon.,5
My dogs love this and it is great for my pup that has an allergy. Plus it easily breaks up so that I can use for training.,5
"I'm assuming this ""noose"" is supposed to loosen when the dog doesn't pull against the leash and tighten when she does. This is the way a choker chain works if it's positioned correctly. We bought two of these leashes. One of our dogs is just happy to be out walking and has never strained against the leash so this leash works fine for her. Our other dog is like a sled dog. You don't even have to say ""mush"". This leash tightened around her neck and she started choking and coughing. We'd stop, I'd loosen it and we'd start again. Again, off she'd go and the noose tightened and she couldn't breathe. When I would tug on it she'd pause and the leash would go slack, but the ""noose"" would not release. I'd have to stop and release it with my hands so she could breathe. We've watched Caesar  M. on TV using his leash on ""sled dogs"" and of course it works like a charm. This leash does't work for our dog. I tried it with the chrome ring behind and in front of the leather ""stop"" and the noose tightened and and stayed tight both ways. It seems the nylon rope is too large in diameter or not heavy enough to easily slide back through the chrome ring when the leash goes slack. I wouldn't buy this product again and don't recommend anyone else do so either. Next time I walk with the dogs I'll try fastening the rope with a cable tie so the ""noose"" won't tighten and in such a way that it can be slipped over her head. That way I hope I can put pressure on her jaw and neck to keep her in check yet allow her relief when she stops straining.",2
the current favorite of my VERY PICKY cat!,5
"Great size, good value, dogs love them",5
"My husband and I bought this dog house for our stray cat...yes, a cat lol. As he came to us as a stray close to 6 years ago when we moved hinto our new home; as a stray he spends 99.5% of his time outside. I spoil him. He's all set up with food & water, a huge bed with a couple fleece throws and a cat house, which is rather small for his size- 18.9lbs. He used it when he HAD to in order to keep from getting soaked during a windy, rainy storm but he had absolutely no wiggle room. Winter is fast approaching and I needed to find a better way to keep him dry/warm. I liked into a patio bra (a covering for an awning) but it was way too expensive at over $3,000.
I looked around on Amazon and came across this dog house and two other. I compared the three...reviews, measurements, materials, etc. and decided on this one. It had the best reviews and lowest price; no brainer lol.

The dog house arrived quickly, five days after purchase. The box it comes in is very secure and thick for protection. The house itself is made out of strong interlocking plastic and is super easy to put together; took about five minutes. We learned the hard way to put it together outside first, if that's its final destination as the roof made it not fit through the door. It was an easy fix; we just took off the roof to get it out and easily snapped it back on once outside.
The only complaint I have was that it was supposed to come with sticker letters so you can place your pets name above the door but mine was missing the stickers...so I just used a Sharpie to write his name on it.

He got into it the same night (4 days ago) and he's used it every night since. Thank goodness because this was our last resort.

It can hold a dog up to 100lbs (and I was able to fit in it- Female, 5'6"", 112lbs) so for him, he has PLENTY of wiggle room.

So far, so good. I will update my review once we're into the winter and I can see how it holds up to the wind & rain.

UPDATE: 8/28/2017
Wanted to update on this a little..
My cat used it with no problems whatsoever- stayed together in all weather, no leaking when it rained (however, I did cover it with a tarp during the winter). He used it all winter long and during the not so hot summer nights. Sadly, my kitty passed away in March, so I passed the house on to my sister for her stray kitty friends, and they also love it.",5
My dogs love these!  They can't wait to get them everyday.,4
My parakeets love it,5
"<div id=""video-block-R1TQNM2SIW8NW1"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1zgb2407ES.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Oy5tJlaaS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;very pretty tank.  IMO it looks a lot better in person.  Oval shape seems to be better for the residents as they can swim continuously without having to stop at the corner.  I had 3 blue eyed forktail rainbow in here for a while and they did great, but now just a couple of shrimp and snails.

Pros: sleek looking, unique shape seems to be better for fishies, maintenance is very simple and theres only 1 cord

Cons: The tank itself scratches easily, the only room for a heater is to stick it in the fiter, the connection to the ac adapter is at the base of the plug so it can get unplugged very easily.  Filter is kind of flimsy so It would be kind of long for the tank to get established from scratch. First Use water from a tank that's already established if you can.",4
Did not receive this but looks adorable,5
Our dogs LOVE this. We use it as a treat as opposed to a main diet staple and they go crazy as soon as a can comes out of the pantry.,5
"made of nice material, and large enough as a summertime water bowl for my golden.  Dishwasher safe.  Nice sheen.  Wish it was made in the US.  I would have payed more",4
Ok,5
"Very functional for tight places, and it comes with all the necessary parts.  Decent looking as well, not cheap looking.",5
"My furbabies love these snacks. We are regular customers. AS long as the prices don't go up, we will continue to buy these bully stix.",5
Wonderful for my 3 doggies. And easy open .  My pups love Pedigree products and I like the vitamins and minerals they get.,5
"These were not cracked or crumbled. The hangers were well placed. These are small for finches or parakeets - a bigger bird would shred it in a few days.
These cuttle bones were in a blister pack on cardboard, and were shipped in a box with tight air cushions, which helped them arrive in one piece. They were NOT fishy smelling, and were clean (not old overstock) and seemed to be new. These are worth the purchase.",5
Best thing I have found for my cat. My 2 older cats love it and my kitten spends all day on it or in it.,5
"I have these for home and the office.  They are graduated shock so after the 1st bark he stops and now all I have to do is put it on him.  These are more affordable than any other brand, and more affordable on Amazon than Petsmart, where I bought my 1st one, and the work better than any I've tried.",5
"This ""doggie bag"" is great! It's very stylish, and my 5lb Pomeranian fits very well with room to lay down. The price is very reasonable for this bag. I highly recommend!",5
"When you find a product that actually works great you share with all your family and friends,well this is it,if you have fur babies,this will take care of those messes and stains,gets rid of residues,odor, and safe on every surface I have used it on,and at mg house it is from hard wood floors,carpet,fabrics,so try this product,it really does work,and is very affordable.",5
"sadly, too big for my pup. he is an 8 lb poodle mix and in between sizes.",4
"My dog loved to play with this toy when I put his raw hide chew toys inside. Unfortunately, when he could not get them out, he proceeded to tear it apart after three days. Love the toy but not the durability for an aggressive chewer.",3
"For me, they are disgusting. But for our dog, they are the greatest thing on the planet. She loves these and thinks she has hit the jackpot when she is allowed to stick her nose in the bag and get one!  (I can't even touch them!)..  But she IS a dog after all, so I will bite the bullet and keep getting them for her!",5
"Once our child began to crawl, we needed a wider gate for the stairs.  Most of the baby gates that I looked at were too short.  Found this gate after a suggestion from a friend and bought two of them, one for top and bottom of stairs.  Works great.  I installed the plastic cups with screws to give it extra support and to keep it in place.  We check the tension screws daily and they have not moved since installation.  The small door is nice to have since we have a cat that stays indoors, keeps baby from going up or down stairs and lets the cat roam the house.  The swing gate is also easy to use and better than having to take down the gate each time to go by.",5
"These bonito flakes are labelled as larger flakes for dogs.  However I have found my cats enjoy these better than the smaller ones 'meant' for them.  The smaller flakes, by the bottom of the bag, are crushed/pulverized.  My cats refuse to even try to eat those.  These larger flakes start out bigger...but manageable even for my smallest cats.  And, by the end of the bag, the flakes are still large enough to interest my cats.

The product itself, the bonito flakes from CatManDoo, is already a quality one my animals love. This larger size makes them extra-appealing for my critters!",5
I work in a grooming salon and I love these clippers. I have both the small and large. I took the little protector piece off both. It got in the way and is not an accurate way to judge where the quick is. They are sharp and comfortable to hold. I highly recommend them.,5
"Safari makes better grooming tools IMHO.  This works the best of several tools I have for knots.  These folks a trying to make better products and succeeding.

Happy Trails",5
"I love this product! I have been using it for my dogs for quite a few years & I can tell you that it really works for their teeth despite I only give it to them once a day, in the mornings. They barely have tartar on their teeth. But I also give them dental treats as soon as they are done eating, so I am sure that it is helping them even more.",5
dogs love them,5
Great cat toy- being used often,5
perfect,5
"My English Mastiff loves this bone! She especially loves when I put the gnawhides in it and it keeps her busy for a long time! I took off one star because the end starts to unscrew while she's chewing it. I always supervise her anyways when she's chewing a bone/toy, etc. but this one I have to constantly watch her to make sure she's not unscrewing the end. She did that to another Busy Buddy Bone and started chewing the end part and ruined it. I was not able to get the end back on of the other bone after she started chewing the end. It had only lasted two months. Other than that, I am happy with this purchase.",4
Great comb for my yorkie's long hair. It gets the snarls and matting out easily.,5
Great but I wish they would make extra long waist strings so they can tie in the front.,4
Works as expected. I am happy with it.,5
Was very disappointed in this leash too light and flimsy,3
Works very well for my pets.,5
"My cat is picky. He'll eat these, but they're not his favorite.",4
"My dogs are Pugs, Yorkie, Shi-Tzu and poodle and it works great, I have back issues so now they just walk right up.  The cover is washable and goes back on with ease.  I think you will be happy with this purchase.",5
Maggie my springer loves this bed - cozy,5
great price and product,5
Got this for my mom as a gift the motor constantly got stuck on her and woke her repeatedly throughout the night (since that's usually when our furry friends like to wake up and cause havoc). Eventually she just turned it off and just uses it as a regular litter box now.,2
great product... was able to scrub up dried catfood from a house that we were renovating once.  the bathroom was filthy and this really helped to get into cracks and corners and smelled very clean during the process.,5
I would consider asking for my money back but the cost wasn't worth going to the trouble. I do have more squeckers and may try to unstitch them and put in a new squecker but...,1
These things are amazing! Can withstand a pitbull terrier mix unless she REALLYYY wants to rip it. These things go like hot cakes in the Petsmart.,5
My dogs have been eating this mixed with their regular food for 3 weeks.  They like it as much as any dry food I have offered and it is grain free.  As these dogs are seniors I am cautious about what I feed their sensitive tummies. The high protein content has not been a problem. The food does have a funky smell that I find disagreeable (-1*) but my daughter says it does not bother her.,4
"Cats love this. Come running to lick it right off a small kitty toothbrush, and occasionally I'm able to actually brush their teeth. At least hey like this toothpaste.",5
Good product,5
These WORK! Great fit and form on our left over dog food cans. They don't get hard in the cold refridgerator either.,5
Good healthy product at a good price. my 12 year old cat been getting a little thick. this product seems to be helping her and she seems to like the taste of the product. Cat likes the taste and is getting a little healthier all positives.,5
"I thought I would try this cat food because the usual dry food has increased $5.00 a bag. Big mistake! After I started feeding this food to our cats they had the worst smelling poops I have ever smelled them to have! It was so bad our largest cat would run out of the box to get away from the smell. Usually you can at least scoop the box twice a day, and the box is good to go. Not in this case. The cats would not get back in the box until it was scooped. Our biggest cat would yowl until someone would come and scoop it out. I got to reading everything on the bag, which I neglected to do with this cat food. Cellulose. Why is cellulose in this food? It really is bad for the cat's digestion and is one of the things that vets say not to feed to your cat. The cellulose can come from ground up pine, paper, or bamboo. It is supposed to help with hairball control but can cause your cat digestive problems because they do not have the cellulase necessary to break it down. If there was pine used for the cellulose, pine oil is dangerous for cats to ingest. So I am not sure how they could get all the pine oil out to make it safe enough to give to cats if it does contain pine. It is added to dry cat foods for cats with weight issues when they need to lose weight. So I am not going to be buying this food anymore for my cats. I just do not feel this is good for my cats. So I went back to the other dry cat food because there isn't any cellulose in it, and the other ingredients are really good for my cats.",1
"This has been one of my dog's favorite toys for the last year and I recently purchased yet another one.  When my dog has done too much chewing damage to it, I take it away and give her a replacement.  This usually takes several months.  However, the last two have been destroyed quickly because I think they are lacking quality control.  The last one had arrived with a small hole on the seam of the head where it wasn't sewed properly.  My dog kept after that spot until it ripped open and that rooster went bye-bye after only a few weeks.  I just got this one less than a week ago.  I noticed a loose string on the body seam which I cut off.  Obviously another defective toy as I just found that seam ripped open and my dog had removed all the stuffing.  Another rooster goes bye-bye.  I know my dog will not be happy to never see a rooster again but I cannot keep paying around $10 or so for a toy that lasts days.  I will have to find something that is better made.  Oh, and my dog is small, only 16 lbs., and I get her the large size.  If this toy can't stand up to her, well...",1
"This was a perfect cover to replace one I had with backing that was coming apart.  The bed I have is 27 x 36 mattress foam and this cover was able to easily slip on, with a little room to spare.  One of the dogs went immediately to it and has claimed it as his own!  It's sooo soft, too.  I can see why he isn't going to let the other dog near it.  I am definitely ordering another one for their other bed.",5
My dog likes it but it was not her favorite like I had hoped,3
Bought this to protect the back seat of my 2013 Ford F150 crew cab.  I did buy the larger size and it fir perfectly.  Love that it is washable and is much easier to vacuum than seat material.,5
It works,3
"My cat anticipated there was something for him when I began opening the box from Amazon. He ignored the charmer and is wildly playing with the ball with feathers, probably because of the catnip. But there was only one toy!
 Hopefully KONG will remedy this right away.",1
Bought for a pot cake and he adores them. They actually stood up to him for quite a while,5
Quality seems good.  Like the multiple rows of teeth.,5
I never tried it myself... BUT they love it.,5
This is great fill it all the time for my pupp!!!!?,5
Works good on the wire hair pointer breed.,5
"This is a very sturdy, well made, cat tree, covered with real carpet.  I bought it to replace a worn out cat tree that was about the same price, but not nearly as well made, and it was covered with a fur type fabric, not carpet like this one.  I have sister cats, but only one of them has ever used a cat tree...who knows why!",5
Again the new pup  loves these.  If given a choice she will pick this treat over Blue Buffalo treats or yogurt and banana ones.,5
"Good news: freshens even the stankiest of dog breaths

Bad news: it tastes so good my dog ate the entire tube... Including the tube itself... While I was at work. There were white stains all over my couch and floor... That was fun to explain.",3
junk,2
Its doing the job.,5
GREAT PRODUCT FAIR PRICE,5
"It's a very small container, but it works wonders!",5
Dogs love them and all my dogs are up in age and all of them grab them up.,5
"Very pleased with this product. Well made and durable. The front strap around the neck has been an issue with other Doggie Lifevest, but this one got it right!
I use this product for my Chihuahua and cockapoo, both under 10lbs, and they are able to wear this with easy and are still able to move/run around.",5
Our dog loves this and the fact that it is grain free makes it even better.,5
"What can I say? I have finicky cats, and neither one liked this food. Usually at least one cat will like something even if the other doesn't, but neither would eat this. I bought a case because the price of wet food locally has skyrocketed, and this was a good price. But they wouldn't eat it, so the savings wasn't worth it.",3
I have given this product extensive use with great satisfaction.  Fritz and I love it and it clearly deserves five stars.,5
"easy to use, though my cat doesn't addicted to this smell",4
Cats love them! Will place on auto order,5
My cats just seem to sit on top of this sack.  I had hoped they would like playing in it.  It's just a bed to them.  But a nice bed.,3
"Go Pet Club did a great job with this condo, it's sturdy and doesn't wobble on the floor like other condo's we've gotten in the past. Out of the box it was already set up enough so all I had to do was screw the legs to the platforms with my hands and secure the whole thing to the bottom with enclosed driver for 4 screws. It took less than 10 minutes to set up & directions are easy. Very well packaged too.
The material is super soft but not padded - which is how our cats like it when looking out the window which is why we got this size. You could put a bed in the top if your cat likes padding, there is enough room for that.
Highly recommend.",5
Very lifelike.  Adorable and cuddly.  Was worth the money for us.,5
"These are not well-made, but you're stuck using them if you have the LitterMaid system. They are far superior to the cardboard receptacles, and will last longer if you line them with a plastic grocery bag.",3
Good quality.  It held up fine from the USA to Norway with my 14 pound dog.,5
"Our cats love the crinkle balls. They slide the balls all over the floor and sometimes, carry the balls in their mouths. Great toy.",5
Love this product!,5
"I converted my choc lab to this brand of dog food and she was a changed animal (shiner hair, healthy appetite and stools), so I wanted my cats to try this brand of cat food too, but they don't seem to take to the taste much, cats are known for being very picky so I will give it time for them to adapt to the taste, I am mixing it with their preferred brand now.",2
That's good. Thanks.,5
"My cat uses this Cat Tree more than anything else in our home!  She sleeps on it throughout the day, and plays and scratches on it as well. The quality of construction and the ease of assembly were great.  The Ivory color was also perfect for our decor.  Highly recommended!  One of my best purchases from Amazon...",5
My dog looks so cute and she stays nice and warm.  The package arrived in great shape and on time.,5
"I like it, but it does not prevent odors as well as the Clump and Seal. It is very light, however.",4
"My senior dog adores these treats. She's getting very old and has a difficult time standing up, but we can usually coax her to stand if we wave these in front of her nose. In fact, the roasted chicken flavor smells so good, I'm tempted to eat one myself! (joking) Don't have much to add about the glucosamine chondroitin. I think the quantity is generous, which I like, but GC needs to be consumed on a regular basis for a few weeks before you can really see a noticeable difference in arthritis.",5
I have been using this type for years and this vendor shipped quick and at a great price,5
"My bunny LOVES this brand! It is the only brand my bunny will eat. I even bought a different brand when Oxbow was not available in my local pet store-and my bun refused to eat it! I highly recommend this brand.
The big bag lasts about a month and change, and the quality is always very good.",5
"My 6 year old lab, didn't like it. I mixed it with his old food, but he would pick the old food out of the bowl and leave the Nutro there.",3
Pump is working great.  Sure makes the birds happy.,5
This fits perfectly in my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Protects my leather and Saves me from having to vacuum every time I take the dog. Charlie loves it too!,5
The dogs really like it and I've been feeding it for months now.  Since its not just a bunch of fillers there is a lot less dog poop to clean up!,5
Poor quality for a Kong toy.  My dog tore it apart in about 3 minutes.  Good idea. I was hoping it would be a QUIET substitution for the Squeaky Ball which my dog LOVES but the constant squeaking  is driving me nuts!!!!  :),1
"Fairly easy to assemble.  My cats love it.  They did send me the wrong color, but I just lived with it.  One screw hole was too big and so one ladder does not stay up.  Otherwise good value.",4
It could probably be a bit warmer.,4
My dog loves these treats.,5
It is so nice to leave her out to play or just watch people! She is 9 lbs and this was the perfect weight for her. I love how long it is for the price.,5
Westie loves them.,5
Puppy loves it!!,5
Great product and fast shipping!,5
cute and the dogs love them -they have squeakers so be sure to watch when they play with them in case they get too agressive and start to pull them apart,4
Cheaply made and didn't last,2
Works well for my older dog.,4
"My 19 yr old kitty (his name is Extra and he is now at the rainbow bridge) had some problems making it to the litter box at times.  These pads are the best for helping in that situation.  They are really absorbent, the wet turns into almost a gel-like substance so the wet is not stepped on etc.  It handles the smell and you can just roll them up and throw them out with no worry of any leakage.  I only wish my Extra cat was still here to use them :(.",5
"My ember tetras, harlequin rasboras and small betas love this. They are making little pigs of themselves.
Only negative thing I have to say is that the seal under the cap was already open when it arrived.",5
very nice,5
"Our dog loves this food, but this seller keeps shipping me damaged goods. In each shipment we get at least one or two severely dented cans. This is not due to shipping. The box it's shipped in arrives without a dent. It's only inside, therefore, the dents are happening before they ship.",3
The dogs loved the feel of the toy - but we didn't love the way it dissolves in water &we didn't love the ease with which the squeaker repeated popped out.,1
"As described, works great, arrived intact.",4
"Ok , just doesn't keep him busy long.",4
"Not as loud as expected, but does the job. I used this out camping, as my dog would bark at everyone they walked by. Within an hour she was not barking at even other dogs walking by.

It didn't have good instructions about how to adjust the pitch, I was twisting and twisting and nothing was happening, then I found another review here on Amazon that showed to pull the whistle out of the black case. It took a little pulling but it came off and then it made sense.",4
It will serve it's purpose but is much thinner then I expected.,4
I read the dog magazine/article and all said that pumpkin is good for dog.  This is tasty too because my Pomeranian can't have enough.  This is soft so I can break it into 2 - 4 pieces.,5
"The scale itself is fine, but I don't like the tall perch.  I bought this to weigh my hawk. I am a licensed falconer and I weigh him to keep him at an appropriate weight.  Because this scale was clearly designed for birds with long tails (like large parrots), or pet birds that don't fly around as much, it is a bit of a hassle for the less ""tame"" falconry birds.  He launches and the top flips off.  I am going to cut down the height and I believe it will work perfectly.  It is dandy for weighing...",3
"I have a scaredy cat chihuahua who panics and runs away from any unfamiliar noise. At first, he ran away when I pulled the Petzoom out, but once I familiarized him with how it worked by letting him lay beside it while on and then using it on one paw, he relaxed. It's not chainsaw loud although obviously when you start filing, you dog might freak out at the sound but my dog relaxed instantly. It works nice, steadily and completely safe. You also can take off the cap it has as a protector and nail debris catcher to get a better reach for the nail. It runs on AA batteries and honestly, I probably wouldnt have bought it if I had known it was a ""As Seen on TV"" product as it doesn't state that in the description and also for the fact that most ASOT products are cheap and break easily but I'm glad I bought this one. It helped me with my dog clipping problem. I would totally reccommend it for skiddish and uneasy dogs.",5
These run so small the XL does not fit what they say. I got an extra large for my Chow puppy and it doesn't even fit over his leg. The XL fits my 19 pound shetland sheep dog. Very disappointed and even more annoyed I have to drive to an Amazon return center.,1
This was a smidget too big for my dog cage to slide in the bottom as it is intended...I had to turn it sideways inside the cage to make it fit and press it down but it works and looks great!,5
"My cat, and one of the neighborhood one as well, love there",5
"Are you kidding me, I just scored this flea and tick collar for a 1.00 to leave my review. Well these are very expensive so landing this Pro guard  flea and tick collar for this price to leave a review is just insane. we have 3 dogs and where we live having this protection is a must for our furr babies.  If your dogs spend any time outdoors this a must product for you to get.",5
Works Great in My filter,5
"This version of Temptations are definitely the best so far.  We have always bought the regular Temptations treats and the cats really love them.  But in this Tumblers (small round treats) format, our kitties go bonkers.  They really love batting these around and chasing them.  They are also a good way for my older kitties to get a little more exercise.  They go into full gear chasing these treats and give it all they've got.

It's clear that they really, really enjoy these.  Temptations Tumbers make for 5 very happy cats.

Recommend them if your cat has eaten the regular Temptations - this shape is a lot more fun.",5
"Very cute, fits well.",5
great product and quick shipping,5
I think its a good quality product.  10 year old dog likes it.  Will buy again.,5
Great product!,5
My bunny didn't like this bc it made loudspeaker noises that scared him.,1
It's great. 11+ kitties eat it like no other food. They are happy I'm happy,5
We have reordered this now 4 times and when we order we order 4 containers so we have tried this for over the years and it really works as it states we will keep ordering the price is right also best price on the internet!!,5
Works well!,4
same,5
Didn't notice any improvement in my dog after using the entire bag.,3
My cat's favorite toy.,5
Cats really loved this food,5
Bought it to mix salt water for water changes and it works great for that!,5
"I really like this bag dispenser because its fairly price and it has a metal hook.
I had already order more than two in the last month.",5
"Has tremendously helped our outings. My dog is a major sniffer which can become a nuisance if on a tight schedule. He also loves to chase squirrels, etc. We have much more enjoyable walks now that he stays focused exercise and our time together. We leave the smelling of the roses and squirrel hunts to our yard. One drawback I see is that this can give the appearance of a muzzle, which may alarm passersby. As we walk to school with our dog, I found I needed to explain to other parents at the school that this collar is used for walking and not to control biting, barking etc, He is a calm, gently dog so I felt bad that strangers were confused by this collar and naturally assumed it was being used for behavior problems. It helped that I see these folks regularly so once clarified, the assumptions went away. It still worth it to have more enjoyable walks and I'm prepared to explain it's use as the need arises.",5
Four non picky cats would not touch the Whitefish Treats. I order the salmon treats in the 14 pack box which my cats love. Last month the whitefish arrived instead. I was happy to keep them as long as the cats liked them. Not one would touch them.,2
"My 2 finicky, spoiled rotten dogs love these! Better price than Wal-mart. I like that they're fully digestible without rawhide.",4
love them they go on so easy and look so cool on my cats and my cats don't mind them they seem to like them to sure saves my furniture from been scratched up would tell any boudy to buy them,5
"Really cheap.. junky.
Just buy a toothbrush at the dollar store, it'll be cheaper and better.",1
"Good deal! My 55 lb. aging dog is able to reach the couch again. After some ""training"" to use the steps, he's begun using them on his own after a week or so.",5
"Seems well made but the strap that supposedly goes around the back is too short to clip in, and the entire cover is a few inches too short width-wise.... Wasn't truly 55.",2
Love gently leads and think they are great product. I love the idea of being able to walk a dog and not have it choking itself for being excited. Gentle leaders and harnesses are a great way of walking a dog without worrying about choking. I just adopted a dog from a shelter and found out she has Kennel cough and I am releived at being able to use this and not cause her any further aggrivation. The only negative thing I could say is that a dog will probably have to get used to them. Mine is not and tends to paw at it a lot if she can.,5
The dog cant tell the difference and I would just assume draping a blanket over and save 30 bucks but the wife likes so I'm happy.,4
"Considering my one year old cat loves to drag around any spare stuffed animals she finds, I thought for sure she would enjoy the SmartyKat Bouncy Mouse toy, but she shows no interest in it, unfortunately.  I was hoping she'd finally give up the sock monkey she discovered several months ago, but alas, that was not meant to be.  The heart (cat) wants what the heart (cat) wants, right?

I went ahead and gave it four stars because it does seem to be well made and looks like it would hold up well - if only it would grab her attention!",4
Love this tag! Regular dog tags always got caught and were too noisy. These look so sleek and I've had no issues with them. Highly recommend and plan to get more!,5
"The Kong extreme toys have survived when no other toy I have tried has.  My aggressive chewer loves it as well.  It keeps her occupied and happy.  I've tried many other toys, but will only stick to the Kong extreme toys from now on.  The others have gone to the trash while this is still going strong!",5
Dog can wiggle out of them during the night. Otherwise good.,5
Great quality!,5
It didn't seem to make any difference for my cat's anxiety. It was a lot to spend to have no results.,2
"I had originally purchased some lightweight canvas car seat protectors thinking they would do the job, but they were a mess.  My poor puppy slid all over the leather back seat with those, and never seemed comfortable; even when we used it with fabric upholstery.  Then I happened upon this protector as an Amazon Daily Deal and figured, it couldn't be any worse that what we were using.  I am happy to report these car seat protectors are great!  My dog no longer slides around and is much calmer on car rides thanks to the soft quilted fabric.  It is a breeze to install and it looks great. I really am so happy I found this car seat protector and highly recommend it to other dog owners.",5
"This brush has honestly been a game changer! We have a big malamute puppy with thick fluffy hair. I had a ""pet zoom"" slicker brush and it kept getting caught and stuck in his fur. I assumed all slicker brushes were the same but the breeder assured me she used slicker brushes. I forget how I stumbled across this brush but I'm so glad we bought it! It's AWESOME and goes through his thick puppy fur so much more nicely. His hind legs feel like they'll get matted fast if I don't brush him a few times a week. He's always so soft after I brush him with this brush!",5
Very nice tag - good quality - good print - small was just the right size...,4
Awesome smell and texture. Very sturdy. Come out of box easy once you get it started.,5
Hope they do,5
Awesome toys for my Dachshund! Indestructible as advertised!! My dog is tough on toys. She destroys almost all the toys we've bought or were given as gifts. I recommend SNUG products to all pet parents whose pet is like mine. The first and last word in pet products!!!,5
Great product for the price,5
"Have to give this oral paste to my cat every day, so I'm glad she likes the taste.  And very glad I can purchase it online.",5
"very cute, soft material but i could not get a good fit on my cat. He is on the petite side, weighing 8.5lbs. the xxsmall was a little too tight in the chest/neck area and the xsmall was too large. I need something in-between sizes. im really glad that i gave them a try, they're great products but won't work for this cat.",4
Cat paws three,3
Totally useless.  Don't waste your money!,1
Works like a charm. My cats are so unhappy being boarded and this help them relax.,5
great price - fast service,5
Cats seem to love it and it performs as specified.  Time will be the determining factor on whether we purchase again,4
Only harness I ever buy for my dogs.  Colors around a dogs neck collapses the trachea so this is much safer.,5
Shih Tzu magic!,5
Our fur babies get one a day and they are like clockwork when they start standing around the cabinet they are in to eat.  They LOVE them!,5
"Love these Xpens.  Easy to assemble, light weight, well made.  PERFECT for RVing and outing at the park.",5
"What's not to love about the Flexi Leash! Even though I live in the country, I still walk my dogs on a leash (never know when some waskly wabbit will jump out and encourage them to chase!). I like that they have a controlled roam and I can still bring them quickly back to me if a car happens by. Most problems with Flexi leashes (and any leash)are due to operator error...i.e dog owners who use them and think they don't have to teach their dogs to behave nicely.",5
"We purchased this storage canister along with an etched stainless steel container.  This one by far exceeds our expecations in comparison with the other.  The overall integrity of the canister is great, the lid fits securely, even when it gets knocked over.  The paw prints and bones on the exterior of the container are easily visible from a distance whereas our other container lacked this feature.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a storage container for treats or food.",5
"The squeakers are so obnoxious (as with any squeaker toy). My dog loves this toy, and will prance around the house squeaking it.
It is a very sizable toy and the squeakers seem to be holding up well.
My dog usually picks at his toys & destroys them fairly quickly trying to get to the squeaker (Great Dane). But, for some reason, he doesn't pick at this one....much.
The few places he has picked at, they don't hold up well (as with most toys). But i'm giving this toy  a 5/5 and not 4/5 simply because he isn't as keen at destroying it as he usually is (for whatever reason) and because he loves it.",5
"We have a FLUTD/FIC cat. She wants nothing to do with her 'medicine ' but she always seems perkier and more playful the next day. It must help with the discomfort.
Note...i have to hold her down and squirt small amounts into her mouth until i get the full dose down.",5
Can't go wrong purchasing YEOWW toys.  They love rubbing their faces on these plus playing with them.,5
"Bought this because, it said it was compatible with sportdog collars, its's working as advertised, keeping my German Shepard out of my office, that she thought was a bathroom = ).",5
"Works perfectly if you are picking up droppings on top of grass as it is advertised to do. Anywhere else on Black Top, Concrete or Crushed Stone a plain old Shovel is better.  Can't beat it for the money.",5
"Nice bounce, durable, our dog's favorite.",5
not sure if it works,2
This product works great for my dogs paws.,5
Works just like it is supposed to.,5
"Been using it a couple months now with my six cats.  Two of my cats had pretty bad tartar, and it is definitely improving.  None of the cats seem to mind drinking water with it added.  My only complaint is that Amazon's shipping sucks.  They put it in a bag, but of the four bottles I've ordered, three of them came open and I lost an ounce all over the inside of the bag and the box and had to clean up the mess to salvage what was left.  They need to start taping the cap closed or something before shipping.",5
Adorable,5
This stuff is pretty much liquid magic. Took care of a flea issue we had within 2 doses.,5
"Very Pleased, Great Service. Thank You",5
"I don't like using these harsh chemicals on our cats and usually don't have to since we live on the third floor but I keep it around just in case. Around here, Frontline is hit or miss but Advantage seems to work just fine when we do have to use it.",4
"At first it fit perfectly. I thought it was going to be great. Then after a few days it just doesn't work with the Velcro and the other material used. When adjusting it to fit, it has to be crooked with the Velcro getting clogged up with the harness material and in a few days it is so stretched out and crooked and clogged up that the only place left to put it is in the garbage can! Sorry, but that's the best I can say about this harness.",1
"Great stuff!  We use in our grooming salon - a little mist is all it takes - coat has nice finish, lite sheen, and does, in fact, dry faster",5
"Lighter duty that I would have expected from Remington. Fits well, but there is no way it will hold up to repeated use in brush.",2
"I didn't even have to open the bag.  When our dogs saw it, they knew what they might get.  And get the rawhides, they did.  They went crazy!  All 3 of our dogs love these rawhide bone treats.  Big and little dogs alike love these rawhides!

These rawhides do last a long time and leave no stink or residue like some other brands we've tried.  I found a coupon code on the internet that gave me a modest discount on the price and the website asked (but did not require) that I leave a product review whether it was good or bad. For price comparison, the full price of $14.99 for 3 ""medium"" is an epic deal compared to our local store that charges the same price for ONE of these, and the store brand isn't even Prime Rib flavored!

If your dogs are bored and you want to give them something to do for awhile give them one of these rawhides.  Your dogs will be happy and YOU'LL be happy that they are entertaining themselves and helping their teeth and gums to boot.",5
"Simply does not work well. The temperature settings appear to be great and it shuts off/on appropriately to the set temp. BUT the heater has almost no power, I'm not sure that its even working at all. The light goes on but doesn't change the tank temperature. I'm using it on a 45 gallon tank (advertised effectiveness to 100G) which has great circulation. If it gets cold in the room, temperature drops and does not recover until I put in a different smaller heater which corrects the temperature quickly. I may have gotten a bad heating unit, but as received, it doesn't heat.",1
Our 50lb mixed breed (labish) and aussie mix broke this open in a few minutes.  They have gotten a few squeakers out.  Working on the rest.,3
Now there's a clicker for every area of the home and property.  The wrist band make it easy to click with one hand and treat with the other.,5
I love this leash. Has the two different handles which is convenient for walking and training my dog. Handle is comfortable. Fast delivery too.,5
"We have been using this crate for about 2 1/2 weeks, and I am actually surprised by the sturdiness of this crate. It is easy to put together and flatten for storage, or to just get it out of the way. My Chihuahua puppy loves it! I like being able to unzip the top for easy access to my puppy, and there is also a velcro tab to hold this door open. The zippers feel sturdy and secure, but I must say that I am curious as to how long they (and the mesh screening) will hold up. So far, so good...even with him clawing at the mesh door when he wants out. I do wish there was a solid piece of material to cover and close the mesh windows for those chilly evenings or when the air conditioner is on, but that is not a major issue...I'll just throw a light blanket over the crate.",5
It works! This is one of 5 products we tried. This worked like a charm. 80 pound 4 year old Lab.,5
Great product and my dog loves it! Prompt shipping.,5
The fish respond well to these salts.,5
This was apparently a pretty tasty bone.  I purchased it thinking it was one of those Nylabone's that a dog can chew on for hours and hours.  Nope.  I guess Nylabone now offers entirely edible bones -- this one.  It was gone within 30 seconds.  I'm glad that the dog thought it was tasty.  I'm sad that I spent $12 on a 30 second chew.,2
It was working great for the first month then boom wheel stopped working so I took it apart and cleaned it hooked it back up still won't spin. I give up I'm frustrated I want my money back but I threw away the box. ,1
"This is a very soft but sturdy harness. I found that once I adjusted it for my dog's size I don't even have to undo the clasp, just put it over her head, and put her feet through. Very easy, even for an 8 month puppy, who tries to eat it as I put it on. My pup is a tibetan terrier, about 17 pounds and the medium is perfect, with some room to grow. Good product, good price!",5
very cute I had to return and purchase in smaller size but I love the item.,5
Smells like chemicals!,2
"My vet recommended Dasuquin for my 12 year old cat, whose joints had been popping while she walked. After two weeks of mixing one pill's worth of powder with her canned food once a day, I hear much less popping, and she seems more agile than before. Amazon's prices are cheaper than my vet's, so that's why I'm here. Great product.",5
My dog really loves these and this pack is big and can last him a while! Hes a 110 pound lab and these are just his favorite.,5
"My doxie mix is about to turn 13 and she was started to move slower. After finding out that she is a healthy old girl, the vet suggested I give her a hip/joint supplement. She has been taking the Hip & Joint chews for over a month now and she is back to being my spry little pup.",5
Great treats!,5
good value,5
This product works well but must be applied daily. It also attracts dirt so whereever you apply it will always have dirt marks. It does its job though and keeps flies off. I just wish it would last longer. sometimes it wouldn't even last the whole day and I would have to reapply. I also suggest wearing rubber gloves when applying because it is very greasy. I would recommend this product because its better than spraying poison on your dog everyday.,4
Has eliminated the pulling of my 60 pound 5 month old puppy whenever he wears it.  Makes walks so much easier!,5
Great post. Cats love it. Wish they would construct a taller one though.,5
Extra squeakers included!  no stuffing - perfect for flinging around.  soft too - puppy loves it.,5
nice dish,5
Birds love them !,5
Great shape and they fit well.,4
My 3 dogs love them,5
"This looks to be well made and should work well for a double leash end,
however, I bought it to tether my large German Shepherd in the back of our SUV (clip one end to collar and one to anchor for child's car seat).  Works great - gives him freedom to look and move around, but I don't need to worry about him jumping out when I open the hatch - something that is not only potentially unsafe for him, but for strangers nearby.
Also keeps him from crowding the backend of the SUV - something I also wanted in case we were ever rear ended.",5
"I purchased the scoop free litterbox about 8 months ago. At the time I used the Omega Paw Self Cleaning litter box we had for 6 years. Which I liked but going to school and working two jobs the litter box oftentimes got missed.
This litterbox changed my life. Fast forward to present day and 2 rescued kittens later I still love the litterbox. It is however costly to maintain. I use the disposable trays which used to last 3 weeks with one cat, now last about 10 days with 3 cats. The cheapest place I have been able to find them is on amazon and so I have them as a subscribe and save. The cats all use the litterbox with no issues.",5
"I purchased a box of these treats for my dog. We all know salmon is healthy, right? And sweet potato is supposedly good for a dogs digestion. But when I opened the first package, the odor of rancid fish oil was overwhelming. I contacted Newman's Own about the problem, and they were on it immediately. They sent me a very apologetic letter, and mailed me a postage-paid return envelope in which to send them both the open package plus one other unopened package from the box of six. After testing, they determined that the treats I'd purchased did not measure up to their standard of freshness, and they sent me not only replacements for the not-so-good Salmon and Sweet Potato treats, but a large collection of free bags of several of their other varieties of organic dog treats, as well as another letter of apology. I was very impressed by their customer service. The new Salmon Treats smelled just fine, and my dog loves them.

I believe this is a great company. I like their charitable business model, and I admire the way they stand behind their organic products. I feel their products are generally excellent in quality, and I'll continue to buy them.",5
"EDIT: Well mine made it 4 years before trying to kill my fish. Noticed this morning my tank temp was over 95 degrees. But something else.

Original review: Works fine to heat a 55 gallon tank with. The temperature indications on the thermostat dial are way off though. Make sure you use a real thermometer. It does hold a steady temp, just not the one indicated.",1
A good buy for the money.  Seems to be holding up well..,5
My dogs favorite and it fits in his treat ball,4
Cats still have fleas. Fleas seem to LOVE this stuff. I'm worried I may have received a counterfeit because Frontline normally always works.,2
"I thought this would be too small for my tall dog but he loves it.  We have left it set up for his full time use even though I thought we would just use it for events.  He likes to go in it and hang out.  It is his haven.  Our dog was wire crate trained as a puppy.  Now, at 4 yrs old it has been over two years since he has had a crate.  He has full run of the house and there has never been a problem.  This is not a crate for a full grown dog who has never been crate trained or for a chewing new pup.  It is easy to set up and break down, perfect for events as well as every day.  Some people commented on a chemical smell.  The manufacturer must have corrected that.  No problem with any Oder at all.",5
Fits into kong . It is a real treat for my lab.,5
great.,5
Didn't work well enough for me.,3
"I have a dane, a large one who likes to pull while on the leash. I am working on training him but it is a work in progress for sure. I ordered this geega pet leather leash hoping it would be durable enough for my beast of a pet.
The leash is classy and looks stylish with my dogs leather collar. The handcrafted leather is soft and easy  to grip. The clasp for the leash hooks securely onto his collar and never comes unclasped. He has pulled hard and the clasp help firmly without giving or breaking.
The leash is able to withstand heavy pulling and never hurts my hand or gives out after lots of use.
This leash is a little thin, but that doesnt affect the durability in any way. The leash is long enough my dog can ""do his business"" without me feeling like I am too close.
Squirrels are an issue in our yard, meaning he loves the chance to chase them, but he has not pulled out of my hands yet since using this leash.
*I received this leash as a free sample in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",5
"They have very short, fine hair and thin skin so a soft, delicate touch is what they need.  They also were rescue dogs so they were not use to being groomed.  It works great for cleaning out dust, removing loose hair, stimulating their skin and body oils which helps them to stop scratching some.",5
As advertised.,5
"I bought this leash fur running because it's short enough to keep my dog next to me, gives her enough length to run behind me when needed and weighs almost nothing compared to most leashes.

My dog is 60-65 lbs. I'm sure she's well over the size limit for this product, but she rarely lunges and when she does, only a quick tug brings her under control. That being said, this leash has made no signs of deteriorating thus far.",5
"great product, easy to use",5
"I'm sure it was fine, but my cat just licked the gravy off the pieces, which are rather large, and didn't eat them.  I tried mashing it up to make a pate but it was too much trouble to keep doing this with every feeding so I donated most of the case to the local animal shelter.",2
Made very well..just did not have the time to really work on my dog with using them  Soon.,5
"Great price for this product!  We have been buying the batteries from the ""fence"" company and they of course have a mark up - buying here will save you lots of money!!!  And they work just fine!",5
neat tag. looks and works great,5
"I love Parisian Pet tees... and this one is perfect for my little ""drama queen"".  I feel they do run a bit small tho'...plus they will shrink a bit if dried in the dryer... so I buy the next size up so she will be more comfortable in it, especially when she's sleeping.",5
"Best product ever!  Excellent quality, made with finest materials.  I used to use 2-3 of other brands, these are so nice, I only need to use one at a time.  I have all my family members ordering them for their pets - both cats and dogs!  BEST PRODUCT ON MARKET.",5
It's a big container with a bowl attached to it.  It holds a few pounds of food.  Does it's job nicely.,5
"This is merely a generic version of Benadryl ( diphenhydramine) packaged up in a bottle with a dog on it. It works the same as the human generic version but at a much steeper price. At this time, you can purchase the generic version for humans on Amazon for about one cent per tablet. This ""dog version"" is selling for 10X that price at ten cents per tablet.

Don't waste your money. Buy the diphenhydramine made for humans and safe your money. It is the same medication.",2
Cats just love these things!,5
The cats love this toy and chew on it regularly. They mostly bat it around on the floor but they do play with it often.,5
cats loved it and crazy about it,5
"I bought this because it is all cotton, which is better for the dog if it's ever chewed on.  It's everything I wanted it to be.",5
"On most occasions, the Scottie requires two of these per day.  These are larger than ones I have purchased in pet stores, but larger is better than smaller.  The dispenser is great.  The ones from the pet stores come in little rolls that require more dexterity and can get a little sloppy in terms of storage.  We accumulate a weeks worth in an outside container and seem to have no problems with odors, flies, or the like.

This has been most successful food in our community tank so far! Lingers just at mid tank just long enough to let the middle feeders get theirs before it sinks to the bottom for the catfish.,5
"Great dog crate and reasonably priced, worth the purchase for sure.",5
"For the price, excellent. Couldn't find one anywhere else for the price but Amazon!",5
"Pros:
1. Cool little toy that bounces around
2. Grabs dog's attention
3. Stimulates dog's mind

Cons:
1. Dog was scared of it initially, she got past this after awhile.
2. My dog is not a heavy chewer, but once the initial fear was gone she utterly destroyed this toy!

Other Thoughts:
Your mileage may vary, but for me this toy was pretty neat to start with, but my dog destroyed it quickly. I think she saw it as a threat as she doesn't usually chew her toys. If you have a chewer type dog I really don't recommend this!",2
I like it,4
Chickens enjoy!,5
"We ordered yellow and mint green, but with the replacement of defective first yellow and then even second yellow kept going off with him making any movement such as walking or jumping down off the couch. He had no idea what was going on. Se, we sent both yellow and green back. Wasn't going to attempt on our smaller more timid little teacup Chihuahua. They were very helpful and understanding.",2
"I switched to Royal Canin foods while my cat was still a kitten.  It didn't seem to be a difficult transition for him.  With the Intense Hairball formula the size of the hairballs has been dramatically reduced.  One bag seems to last a really long time so I think it must be filling for him.  I like the way the Indoor Beauty 35 makes his coat feel, but I think the Intense Hairball 34 is a better choice for him.",4
"My picky cats won't eat some foods and get tired of other foods they start out liking.  However, they love this brand/flavor and have continued to enjoy it for quite some time now.",5
I have tried benefil but my two dog's love this duck flavor so I have this on subscribe and save. Mixed with Rachel Ray dish dry dog food. I also tried blue supposedly a great product but both my dogs got the worsed Case of diarrhea and intestine problems.,5
Our dogs love it!,5
"As a cat owner (that can't be right, but moving on) of 50 years, litter mats have come and gone.  Easyology is here to stay.  The material is soft on their paws, and the design traps the litter before they can track it through the house.  When I clean their area, I just shake the pad gently to clean it for use again.  Best ever!",5
Great little filter. Works well. Purchased a couple of them. Perfect for what I needed.,5
"My cats instantly took to this litter. It doesnt last as long as advertised, but I have two cats. Tracks some, but less than clay and the tracked bits are smaller and less painful when stepped on! Does a good job with odor control if scooped regularly. Clumps are pretty solid for the first week or so. Not dusty at all  some crystals are really dusty but this has been pretty good! Very expensive vs clay, but it saves my back when I do the full box change since its very lightweight.",4
"too soft for my Chihuahuas, right in the garbage.",1
Photo is misleading.  You get one.  It was for my iguana.  It might hold a mouse.,2
My dogs love playing with this ball,5
"I have a Honda Accord. It just didn't fit well. With the windows down, as our dog loved so much, the top near the back window would catch the wind and flap. It's ugly and I thought made my car look trashy.  Can't verify if it's truly waterproof or not.",1
"great nail guard, strong clippers, work great for our big dogs feet -- roll the pups (100#+ dogs) over on their back, clip clip clip all done and they're on they way to play",5
"These brushes are the perfect size variety for cleaning the pump areas, into crevices, and the fountain bowl. Love them!!!",5
Dog was Happy with Santa,5
A very good product. Don't have to constantly refill the water bowl. Needs to be cleaned from time to time. My dog was a bit scared of the bubbles at first but got used to it. Recommended.,5
"Cat loves it, I haven't tried it!",5
"Our cats loved these, maybe too much! The portions are exactly right for one meal. They love the taste and it seems to satisfy. My only complaint is they seem a little more expensive than other ""gourmet"" style foods. Maybe keep these as an occasional treat, rather than for every meal",4
"Soooooo darling!!! Can't wait to see it on her!! I am getting my little Cissy as a rescue from out of state!!!  REALLY pleased with how this looks. I hope it washes up nicely. She is coming from a warmer climate. If this works as well as I think it will, I'll probably order another one or two!!",5
"This seemed to work well. My dog had been itching at his ears for a while and though it didn't smell like an infection, he is very prone to them. Used this daily for 7 days as directed and within a few days I noticed he stopped itching and hasn't since the course was completed. Definitely will keep on hand for future! Much cheaper than vet visits and scripts. FYI, I clean his ears regularly with cleanser b/c he is prone to ear infections.",5
"He is interested in it but I think he gets bored with it after a bit - but i think this is just his personality. He is really active and loves to leap in the air and do acrobatics when it's play time and obviously this toy isn't designed to foster that sort of play. My recommendation is know or get to know how your kitty likes to play and then you will know whether this will be of interest. It does foster 'hunt mode' to a degree so that's nice.
Construction of the toy itself is ok. The cloth in the holes gets worn easily and starts to fall down..when that happens it is harder to 'surprise' your kitty with where the mouse is going to pop out of.",3
Excellent!!,5
"Dogs love them, but they are messy on carpets.  Dogs win, I can clean up.",4
I bought this for my dog yeast infection and it doesn't work. She still the same as when I started her on it.,1
"Very great product..  Like other reviews, this is smaller than expected.. Could be used for a puppy but definitely not for a full grown dog.  Please be aware of that.  Other than that, if you have a smaller dog, this is 100% for you.  GREAT quality and great size FOR A SMALLER dog.  My wife loves this and can't wait to use it.

Only reason I didn't give it 5 is the size.",4
This is like cat crack. I sprinkle it on wet cat food that's been in the fridge so it's more appetizing.,5
"Who can enter the mind and desires of a cat? Mine is a Hemingway cat; he has six toes and you'd think he'd need more, not less, food to feed the extra digits. But no. He won't eat home-made food, milk products of any type, fish, fowl or vegetables. Of tasty mammal victims, he only wants beef. And he only wants it fresh. Friskies are the only taste and pong for which he rushes into the food corner. I wish the company would make miniature cans, as after he's full he won't return to finish even if I seal the can or refrigerate it. I think he may truly be descended from Ernest Hemingway, a real, meat-eating Man. Mr/Ms. Friskies: do you have any suggestions?",5
7.06-Once is a large amount - just be aware.,4
Thing is huge!  Can def have another gpig in here which we will probably do.  Just got today so cannot really give a clear liking-ness on the gpig side but I think I might have to add some liner to grates.,5
"The only thing I wondered about was whether my "" almost blind small 17 yr. old Jack Russell "" would like the feel of the mat ... she was fine with it... helps to keep her kibble coralled as she picks out only certain bits to eat ...the rest gets put outside the bowl...less cleanup... we have her food close by us to make sure she is eating ...(we have cats who like to steal her food) Could have used a larger size but this works...Probably will get another one for the water bowl which is in another area of the home...",5
My dog had a lot of yeast in his ears this really helped and it smell really good. I pour some onto a cotton ball and wipe his ears that way. His ears are great. No bumps on his ears. Seems to work great. I really love this product. Totally recommend.,5
My Golden Retriever puppy loves this toy. Very durable. He likes this better than the football shaped version.,5
"This wipes are really nice, we use them in rainy days where the paws and the bellys of our dogs get really messy, well this ones leaves them clean after going out in a rainy day.",5
"Very stylish. Fits my Boston Terrier, 22lbs",5
Good product.,5
Heavy duty pooper scooper,5
"Finally found a harness that (sort of) fits my Doxin (without spending $100 on a 'specialty' one)well enough to be able to use it without feeling like she's either going to walk out of it (which she has with others - just turned around and pulled it off) but this one adjusts enough that she doesn't seem to be able to do that (at least yet). I wanted something for car safety and wouldn't choke her when walking, since she's a ""puller"". This one seems to do the trick.  I bought one for my Min. Amer. Eskimo, too, and it fits her very well.",4
"This tug toy is made out of thick rubber, it is alot of fun for the dog. The rubber is very durable and even with all of the play it has gotten my dog has not punctured it at all. Great value half the price pet stores charge.",5
Soft butter leather.,5
These are great. Saves a lot of money over the disposable ones,5
They love it,5
"Can't prove definitively if glucosamine works for my two Goldens, however we've had no negative side effects.  This product came very highly recommended by a Labrador lover who swears it changed her more mature dog.  Though her dog didn't mind the taste, mine both aren't big fans, but they are kibble snobs.  I do NOT like the dispenser.  You think you can measure accurately, however you cannot see the level through the thick white plastic.",4
I LOVE this bowl aquarium. I truly don't have a single complaint.,5
Excellent item for your pet.,5
"The box says to apply this product onto four different spots on your dog, as per the picture shown. This did not work for my pup. It irritated her skin, near her lower back & tail and she itched terribly. I thought she might be allergic, but the vet told me to simple apply the meds to two places, near the end of her neck and at the top of her back, where her shoulders meet. She is just under 55lbs. This worked much better, though it does tend to drip onto the fur and stays moist for 8-12 hours after application.",4
My girls seem to like it!,5
"I bought three of these harnesses in three different designs (Sea Glass, Just Ducky and Peace Pup) for our cats and am quite pleased with the quality of each. The material is thick and very tightly woven so I don't think these would fray anytime soon. The designs are nice looking, all three of them - pretty but not too, too eye-catching :-).

I particularly like that they adjust easily and accomodate a wide range of sizes. We measured our felines' girths before ordering and they were 15, 16, and 18 inches. The harnesses fit all perfectly. Opening and closing them is equally easy with buckles. One small but thought-out detail: The buckles are located up on top which makes it easy to open/close for the owner but almost impossible for the animal to rid itself of the harness - accidentally or otherwise.

Of the three, the Peace Pup was by far the softest whereas I found the other two to be on the stiff side. Hopefully these will soften with use as I imagine they might be a tad uncomfortable for the cats to wear. The one-star deduction is for this.

All in all really a quality product which I recommend.",4
"My cats normally eat this brand, but this flavor did not go over well. I ended up giving it to my daughter-in-law for the neighbors outside cats.",2
"My big 14-pound tabby loves it, and it handles his weight just fit. He can also fit into the houses when he wants to. So yes, this will handle extra-large cats just fine. And it's SILENT when he climbs into it, so you won't get woken up at night. The only downside I can really see is that the ramps could be a little less steep and anchored a bit better so they don't move as much. Not that my big cat cares; he's super-athletic and just bypasses them. But my non-athletic little Siamese doesn't care for it. But I bought it to keep the big cat out of trouble, and so far it's done a superb job of it.",5
Good.,5
Works well with the deshedding shampoo. My dogs fur is much softer and I have noticed a change in shed. It's definitely not as much.,5
THIS is the best cat litter deodorizer! Luv it.,5
I used to feed my cat Royal canin dry food but after doing some research I decided to have them try different kinds of grain free food to see what they like. I hate to say this...but after adding water to this it looks like sh*t.... I feel bad for my cats because I don't even want to look at it... And they barely touched it. My ragdoll is very picky. But my shorthair literally eats everything but he didn't touch it at all... I had to throw this away and feed them Royal Canin. Good thing is recently I gave it a try again without adding water. My shorthair cat ate it... Don't know if it's good for him though... Not going to purchase it again.,4
"Still got lots of burn marks, especially from my 140 lb Great Dane.",3
"This is smaller than I thought going by dimensions, however it is easy to put on and remove.",3
Our favorite shampoo for out dog. It's mild and washes of well.,5
I transport foster dogs from location to location and the ease of which this comes off is very handy. I wash these frequently and so far it has stood up to numerous dogs and washings. It covers my entire backseat area and has saved me numerous times from car sick dogs and fur everywhere. I highly recommend having a seat cover for your car if you have pets. I received my dog seat cover at a promotional discount and it was subject to positive or negative feedback but it has done everything I asked for so I am impressed with its value.,4
Lucky loves his toy and fetches it quite often.,5
"Awesome, safe, organic product for your pet!! Highly recommend purchasing if you want something safe and healthy for your pet thats non-toxic!",5
"For some reason, my cat has yet to show interested in this scratching post. Why then, you may ask, did I give this product a 5-star rating? First off, the construction quality is solid. This isn't the first scratching post I've owned, but I can tell it's a good one; I think my new cat is just weird! Second, the price value is really good. Third, and most important, the manufacturers absolutely stand by their product! If you have any issue, contact them directly and they'll go above and beyond to ensure you're a satisfied customer! Go ahead and get this product with the confidence that the seller is on your side.",5
My pup hates green dental chews. Loves these.,5
DOG LOVE THIS TOY,5
A little bigger than I expected but I can trim them down to fit.,4
"What can I say about Da-Bird other than this is the most amazing interactive cat toy I have ever owned! I don't even bother with other cat toys anymore. Something about this toy replicates the way birds fly or the noise their feathers make. My cats go bananas for it. I have to keep it locked up in a closet or they will carry it all over the house and chew it to pieces. They come running from all over the house when they hear the closet door open because they know what's in there. True Story: I was being vetted by a pet owner who wanted to give up her two grown cats (9 years old) for adoption. She had no choice but to part with them and was very upset and reluctant to let them go to just anyone. She had already rejected 10 other applicants by the time I applied. When I went to visit with the two ""cat boys"" I brought this toy along. They played with me for 2 hours even though they didn't know me. She was astounded. She said the cats didn't even stay in the room 10 minutes with the other applicants and she had never seen them play like that before. She was thrilled. I told her I couldn't take credit it was the toy but she was still so pleased that I ended up getting my two new lovable babies from her and they still absolutely adore this toy.  It does take a beating and you have to replace the feather attachments from time to time but I find even off-brand attachments do well and hold their interest. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to entertain their cats.",5
My cat loves all the fish flavors.  Well worth every penny.,5
"Not bad for 1/2 the price of Embark.  You can add whatever protein to this and the dogs are happy.  We make a chicken soup with carrots, green beans, diced potatoes, and parsley.  They love it.",3
My cat loves these.  He has a history of UTI's so I'm very careful about his food.  I also add cranberry extract to his food to increase water intake so I was happy to find treats that contain cranberries as well.,5
My Little 7lb dog will eat the whole dental chew in about 3 to 4 mins.,5
"Poodle is very itchy sometimes, so I try to buy him treats that are as hypoallergenic as possible. He likes these duck treats. They are each 2 to 3 inches long, they are somewhat chewy and tough but he enjoys that. I usually will put one in a treat puzzle for him. It is made in China, which people worry about, I recommend checking out dogfoodadvisor.com for some information on that; apparently almost all dog food sold in the US still sources some ingredients from China. Poodle is 16 lbs and has had no trouble with them. This is also a much better deal than the package I bought in my local pet store, FYI.",4
My dog loves these!  They're a great chew that doesn't upset her tummy or mess up the house with crumbs.,5
So I thought this was going to be more of the size of a coin purse but it's quite large. I was a little bummed at first but ended up really using it. It's great for holding a skein of yarn!,4
"While the product is well made and sturdy, they really need to improve sizing.  I have an English Springer Spaniel, for which the Large size was so big that the straps wouldn't secure and the large piece went clear back to her rear where the second piece should go.  The medium is so small that the straps won't come close to fastening.  There is apparently NO size made for dogs in between Labradors and mini poodles.",2
"Neutralizes chlorine, chloramine, and ammonia. Water tests before and after indicate that the product works. Concentration is strong enough to use in ponds and large fish tanks. I buy the big container, then pour into a smaller empty container of the same product with a 10ml cap for easier dispensing.",5
This is perfect for the back porch. My baby girl loves having water outside,5
Pleasant scent that will linger for a day or two but is not overpowering. Keeps her fur nice and soft and helps with dry skin during the winter.,5
"Charlie here! I am the family's best judge of dog foods and biscuits. I really know my dog foods and treats. I am a connoisseur. And I am a dog! So, you can take my word for it: these treats are extra yummy. I love them, but so do my two sisters and my brother. We all beg for these, finding them irresistible. They have an irresistible chicken flavor, and they provide us with long-lasting chewing satisfaction.

Mom likes these a lot. They contain only chicken, glycerin, and salt, so she knows that even my grain-sensitive little sister can enjoy these. Each stick contains 34 calories. Plus, there are no nasty chemicals to make us sick. And besides, these treats keep us busy and quiet for a fairly long time. I am happy that Mom will be buying these for us.

We received a free bag of these treats in exchange for an unbiased review.",5
Perfect for what I was looking for! Just the right length of dog training,5
doesn't fit as well as the many other gooby products we use,3
My dogs like it and its good for them too.  I mix it with their canned food and they scarf it up!!,5
"Great litter. Not too dusty, clumps very well, is light to carry and pour, my cat likes it.",5
"Excellent cat litter, fragrance free, and clumps well for easy clean up",5
"I love it that this leash came with little bags for pet waste. Overall, it has a great design and is simple to use.",5

Good product,4
"These are HUGE pieces of jerky and a great treat for my black lab. When his eyes widen and his nose twitches I know I have found a good treat. He was particularly thrilled with this one. I am giving it to him as a VERY special treat for being a very good boy. It smells good and seems like it's made of pure ingredients. It's expensive, but not more than other similar jerky treats available in pet stores.",5
Sifts out most of what it is supposed to and hangs on to the poo poo.,4
"What a shame. I was sooooo hoping my cats would get used to the top opening on this. But, of course...being cats....they did not. So, I ended up paying so much more for a glorified plastic tote I now use for a litter box. So be careful. Your cats may or may not want to suddenly go ""spelunking"" to use the litter box. Actually, I really don't blame them. I wouldn't want to crawl into a dark cave to use my bathroom, either! (PS: Should've listened to Jackson Galaxy, as he's said covered litter boxes go against a cat's natural instincts to be able to see what's going on around them while they're doing their business.)",1
"My pups love to squeak & destroy toys!  Durable, but was not their favorite.  The overall covering was hard in their mouth and they found it difficult to play with.  Ended up tossing it out after a few weeks.",2
"WOW I totally thought this was just a novelty item that Id use for photos lol but my french bulldog puppy is obsessed with this thing! Its his favorite toy to carry around... We play fetch with it and he even carries it when he pottys lol!! Its small though, perfect for him as a 10 lbs frenchie pup but will be too small when hes grown. I hope they have a larger one that I can order!",5
"I bought this sweater as an ""everyday"" type for my little guy so he wouldn't be chilly.  I live in northern new england.  As such, it serves well.  He is a jack Russel with short hair.  His sweaters have a tendency to want to travel backwards; this one is no different.  He has a large chest and a very trim midriff.  This sweater fits him, but it is very brief.  The texture of the sweater is as if it were cotton cable knit, but I believe it is a synthetic blend (poly/acrylic). It is very cute.  Just be aware that it is short, or, if you buy longer, it may be a bit loose in the chest.",3
The only treat my cat responds to!,5
This is the third time ive purchased this for my dog and every time we recieve it she reacts the same. She goes nuts sniffing the bag so excited. She still loves it!,5
Dogs are in heaven. Should of gotten one for each. For they will try to share. Lol.  Good water toy too.,5
"cheaply made, not worth the money! the seam came apart day one.",1
"Great for our new pup, she is growing so fast and this keeps her busy and keeps her from chewing on our stuff. Very nice.",5
Works good it's worth every penny,5
"When I give this to my fuzzies, they would eat the whole tube if I'd let them! They take this readily and so far there have been no hairballs or other blockages(that I know of)! I give a ""pea sized"" amount to both ferrets every couple of days and maybe a little more if I don't think their droppings look okay... I don't see any difference as to the amount of droppings they produce or the smell so these are both a plus! I will continue to buy Marshall FerretLax if it means my little fuzz butts won't get blockages! :)",4
"I had to get a refund for my mistake looked good but my cats nail were bigger, so my bad. but got refund right away no problem probably would work good for what these are for.",3
"My dog is VERY picky and all other ""treat"" supplements have to be force fed to her.  However she takes these willingly and she has to eat 3 of them, so that's saying something. She seems to be much more comfortable in her hips and back too. Definitely worth the price.",5
It shipped quickly. My dog wasn't too excited about them.,3
my cats love this stuff & the price is just like in the pet stores,5
"Black lab played with and carried around for 4 days.  Then chewed through ""invincible"" outside webbing/binding.",3
Love it!,5
My cats love these.,5
"This stuff is disgusting. If it gets wet it gets lodged in my turtles leg hole areas, it gets all over their face and in their eyes. Not recommended for turtles",1
I have owed several of these litter boxes. They are good quality. The only cat that wouldn't use it was my 21 pound boy. He was just too large.,5
"Love this, as it protects the seed from falling out of the cage and onto my carpet.",5
My dog loves them but they don't last very long... the bigger bully sticks seem to last longer (like 3 of these don't last as long as an 18 one),4
"First, let me start with that I have decided to keep this so take my complaints with a grain of salt.

1.  Item not as pictured at all.  The item that arrived to me is entirely the same color.  There is not shade difference as pictured in the 'beige' model.
2.  One of the 'houses' arrived broken.  This is not surprising becuase the walls of the houses are made with the same crappy cardboard you would find as the backboard on an Ikea bookshelf.  I'm not sure of the long term structural stability of those considering one my my cats immediate jumped on it to climb to the top with his claws.
3.  The inside of the ""houses"" are not carpeted.  I found this strange as every cat condo I have owned so far has had carpet inside those.  Another reminder of how cheaply made these are.  I have to reinforce the broken wall anyway so when I do I will have to glue some carpet in there.  Including this cost, I could have just bought the more expensive model.
4.  The bottom ramp secures with a single bolt to the bottom of the 'house' platform and a single bolt to the underside of the ramp itself.  No matter how much I tighten these I can't get that ramp to stay in place.  I may remove it completely.

Overall, I'm disappointed but don't feel like dealing with boxing it back up and returning it.",3
This is OK for a quick touch up around the tummy area or a quick refresh. I do like the scent and my dogs don't seem to mind it.,3
"Night and Day!  We have an 8th month old puppy who loves walks but isn't yet trained to walk appropriately.  This allows my 11 year old share in the walking the puppy load, three times a day divided amongst the family is helpful.  It also helps me go on runs with him.",5
"I am a fan of several Nylabone chews, and so is my pup, but this isn't one of them. The pup (a four-month-old German Shepherd who is a nonstop chewer) has very little interest in this rib chew. Every once in a while he'll pick it up and carry it for a minute, but aside from an initial minute of chewing when I first presented it to him, he does not chew on it. The shape is very awkward for chewing. I also find the texture and appearance to be unappealing. I can understand why he doesn't care for it.",2
"My two cats share this bed even though I have two others without the heating capability right next to this one!  It gets slightly chilly in the room my cats live in, so this thermo-kitty bed fits the bill.  For those who might be concerned it can get too hot--it doesn't.  When I put my hand on it, it just feels slightly warm--that's it, but enough for my cats to use it during the winter!",5
"Furbabies didn't like them, too big",3
Good product but sizing from one order to the next seems to be inconsistent. Large in May may fit my Golden but then buying a large in December might be really big and she can't wear them.,4
this is a must for any dog owner.  make sure that it fits snug.  this ensures that your dog can't slip out of it.  this is the go-to collar if you take your dog running!!! it is a nice bright color - more neon-ish than dull green which is good especially for a black or brown dog.,5
perfect and only a dollar!  What more could you ask for?,5
I house sit 4 cats. This feathered cat toy works wonders in keeping the cats occupied and entertained. Works better on the kittens. Fun little toy that can give plenty of fun.,5
Package arrived smashed. Because the product is all cardboard this greatly affected the ability for us to put it together and have it stay together. The sides fell in every time it was bumped. Not useful for my cat at all.,1
My cat loves this thing <3,5
"I'll start by warning right off the bat that the sand you receive is not the sand pictured. We knew that when buying it so no problems there. It's great stuff, though for cycling a new tank. Good luck with shipping though.",5
"This is a very heavy duty ball and my dog is a strong chewer and to date its the only toy she hasn't been able to chew to bits in a matter of hours.  However, it is really expensive $27.oo and the ball didn't come with an original purchase receipt so it might not be replaceable. Update:  She played with the ball for a day, maybe two and then completely ignored it.  Never touched it again - so it was a waste of money.  I gave it to the neighbor for his Pitbull - he never played with it either.",2
"My cat doesn't seem thrilled by this food. He eats it, but he doesn't scarf it down like his other options. I don't notice any other changes after giving him this food for 2 weeks now. He still has bouts of throwing up. I figure it's just a cat thing. <shrug> The ingredients seem quality enough, and maybe the lack of grain filler keeps him from eating a lot of it.",4
"This harness fits perfectly and it seems to be more comfortable than our old harness.  I like the color, too!",5
"So far, so good.  I bought these to use for my dogs bark control collar and they work great.  I have only used 3 so far and I have had them a couple of months.  They seem to hold a charge well and it is always going off because my dog is a barker.  I'm thankful for the other reviews that recommended these batteries because I was having a hard time picking them out.  You can't find this size in a regular store like Walmart, etc, so I'm glad that I found them here.",5
My two Pixie-Bob kittens love these.  I like the bigger size because they are big kitties and these don't get lost as easily but they can still through them around and catch them.,5
Lasts about 3 minutes or less per ball with a Malinois.,1
What can I say this toy is excellent.  Really makes the cat chase and hunt down the ball which they cannot get out..  Good exercise and stimulation for your cat.  we also got the flashing ball which our cat loves.  Very amusing.,5
"After going through 3 filters in about 1.5 years (all 3 were the same brand and purchased from Amazon), I figured it was about time to try out a new heater. The Aqueon Pro has met and exceeded my expectations so far (less than a year's use). The build is very durable and is not glass so no need to worry about it shattering. It almost feels like a plastic type material, and it would be pretty difficult to break this. One thing I really like is that I can keep the power plugged in while doing water changes and it does not hurt the heater at all (yet). I am hoping this will last over a year, but if it dies before then, I will update my review to reflect that. I am in no way gentle or really caring of my aquarium heaters, so if it will break, I am guessing it will break within a year. If it can take my abuse for over a year, the price was worth it to me.",5
Great price! Came as expected and in perfect timing!,4
"Vehicle installed on: 2012 Ram 1500 Laramie CC

Simply put: These guards fit nicely into the window channels in my truck. They slide in and out with ease without causing any damage to the window or the existing tint. When you roll the rear windows down, they stay put.. and they do slide up a tad when you roll the windows back up, but they do not slip out on their own. After noticing this, I put them through a few tests and I could not get them to completely fall out of the channels. The plastic tabs are long enough to keep this from happening. They also fold up very easily and stow away in the rear pockets of the front seats or (where I like to keep them) in the rear floor storage compartments. Basically, they fold up nicely ans take up very little space so they could be stored practically anywhere within the vehicle.

They are the perfect (and cheap!) solution to keeping my dog's paws and drool off of my doors, especially the door handles. I would (and already have) recommended these guards to a few friends and family members and will continue to do so. The cost is worth every penny when you consider you will no longer have nail scratches on the door interior or drool/slobber in the door pockets. Two thumbs up here!",5
"I maintain several cat boxes in 2 households, one i use the plastic square scooper and one I use this.  Although you scoop less with this, it sifts faster, doing corners and edges is not easy and I had to bend it to be at a correct angle.  It works",3
TIe lasted less than 6 months with minimal use.,2
These are nice to hang in rabbit cages. Helps prevent cage boredom.,5
Amazing,5
"My Doxies love this toy, they will play with it for long periods of time.  I always buy this toy in multiples, because the smaller version is hard to find.  The larger toy is almost as big as they are.",5
Great product.  My dog thinks she is getting a treat and it is realy good for her.,5
My dog really like this,4
Keeps my dog's ears clean. Economical and have had no problems.,4
"HUGE and very fun, but the fabric tears easily.",4
"I've been using Fresh Wave for about a year, this stuff is amazing, I don't know how it does what it does, but with a couple of small open containers of this gel throughout the house, guests can't tell we have 2 boxers and 2 cats.  It's  safe if the animals get into it, (they don't) The spray is great and safe to rub onto a stinky wet dog before drying them off.  Once you start using it, you'll never want to be out of it.  I wish I could buy a barrel of it and never run out! I'll bet other user who know would say the same thing!",5
My cats love tasty treasures,5
"I thought these would hold up better to washing than they did. I bought two, one for each dog and after two washings (cold water and low dry) the larger one lost a lot of the loft inside and the color totally changed to a darker color, the smaller one kept most of it's loft and the color didn't change.  I usually like midwest products but am disappointed in these.",3
I use this to supplement the Wellness dry food for a change of taste. They love it.,5
"Great for dogs with hot spots! You can see a change after just one bath with this shampoo. And on Amazon, it's a lot cheaper buying it than from the vet's office.",5
"I did not realize that the width of the panels is considerably more than the width of the panels of the taller playpen.
It is awkward and does not fit well in my dogs' playroom.  It is very well made and the connecting mechanism is excellent.
SO easy to move about.  I think it would be helpful if the sales people stated on the picture that it is wider than the larger model.",3
"This is the best Harness I have gotten.
I have gone through several harnesses and
this is the best one and the strongest one I have
gotten. My dog loves his walks and I wasn't able to walk him without
a harness - this has made us both extremely happy",5
"Let me start out by saying I bought this 65 gallon model as a replacement for a two week-old SeaClone 100, and am I glad!  I found this in the local Petco for $199 and looked it up on thier website, where they wanted $119 + Tax with free shipping, the store refused to match thier own website price.  So I was planning to buy it from the website, but then I said ""Self, you're an Amazon Prime member, lets check the price there!"", so I did.  So with a shipping upgrade of $3.99, in less than 24 hours the box was at my front door; total cost: $115.19, enough said!

OPERATION: Now for the product, so after setting this up (like all the others say, throw out the directions, they are useless) I could not get it to work properly (pumped water but no bubbles), after disassembling checking everything, and reassembling, it still would not produce bubbles; I could have saved a hour plus by simply blowing in the air tube and kick-starting the venturi action (doh!), so try this first!  Within minutes this unit produced more foam and removed more protein than the SeaClone 100 did in two weeks; and 24 hours later the micro-bubble pattern in the unit is starting to take shape, reducing the amount of bubbles pumped into the tank.  I hope that when it breaks in the bubbles in the tank cease completely, so I will update this in a few more days.  It wasn't to difficult to balance the flow, I set the output valve to 50% then adjusted the input valve, located near the pump, until the water and micro-bubble concentration point was halfway up the cup port; this allows me to use the ouput adjustment to set the levels for either the ""Dry Skim"" or ""Wet Skim"" methods as described in the directions (the only useful part of the manual).

DESIGN:  The unit does not fit well on an aquarium with a glass hood; the hard 90 degree input bend extends past the two inches allowed for hang-on-tank (HOT) equipment.  I was able to put enough twist to get the glass on, but it's a very tight fit (pictures above).  The HOT bracket needs to be adjustable, or the hard 90's need to be replaced with the flex tubing as shown in the actual directions that are included. I will be looking for a way to extend the bracket myself, just because I don't like the hardware pushing against and vibrating my glass hood.  The air tube is connected to what I guess is either a muffler or small backflow cup, but there is nowhere to mount this component; on the box they show it on top of the HOT bracket, so with a little velcro, that is now where mine is placed.  The collection cup: I have to assume the manufacturer swapped out the cups in the ""Newly Designed"" models with the 125, this cup is huge and comes with the drain (cap and short drain tube included), I plan on adding a longer draintube so I can run it to a jug in the cabinet when I want to run it as a wet skimmer.

TROUBLESHOOTING TIP: When you get it turned on and the unit sucks up your water and does NOT produce any micro-bubbles, don't disassemble it looking for obstructions as indicated by the chart in the directions.  Just blow into the air tube and it will start working, this will save you at least an hour of frustration.

OVER-ALL: I like this skimmer, it's not even broken-in yet, and it works great!  There is a really noticeable difference in the amount of micro-bubbles entering the tank as it runs longer, hopefully by the time it breaks in, there will be zero bubbles.",4
"Bought two orders of s-repens. One order came in fine, the other came completely rotten. Hit and miss with the seller 'greenpro', be warned.",2
"I'm writing this review with a heavy heart. We had to put our 14 year old fur baby down because her heart condition eventually won the fight and I never got to use the 2 bottles I ordered. I ended up giving them to a friend that dog has the same condition cookie did. She had fluid in heart and lungs. She took Lasix, a diuretic, which depletes potassium. I was told this by a vet cardiologist to get this product and the change in her energy level was HUGE! I was so surprised. This is really good stuff if your animal is on a diuretic like Lasix. This review is in memory of cookie RIP",5
I got this last year and it is the cats most fave ever drinking vessel. They drink more water than with any other weve tried. Its a little high maintenance if you have more than a couple of thirsty cats as it needs to be refilled every two or three days. No biggie for me but Ive seen others make negative comments about having to refill too often. Mine prefer it without the flower in the middle. The pump has worked just fine but it has gotten louder as time goes on. It also seems like the water stays cleaner in the portion where they drink from. OH - If you have power outages make sure you take the top off so they can access the water. They won't be able to get to it if the pump gets turned off.,5
"This has been a fantastic purchase. My kitties love it and it was quite easy to put together. As others have complained, one side of one of the particle board cubes was broken (it's quite flimsy and thin on that side) but I didn't bother to return or complain about it. It was on a side which didn't bear any weight and the carpet was in fine shape over it. All in all, it really didn't make a difference and you can't even tell - I only noticed when I was assembling the tree. It's pretty sturdy and the sisal is great. I'm quite pleased with it.",4
This collar cannot be adjusted to fit properly and is made of very stiff material. I have already replaced it with another model and make and strongly suggest spending a little more for a good collar.,1
We have a baby ferret that seems to enjoy rolling around in the ball.  BUT even though we check to make sure both ends are locked in place the ferret always finds it's way out of the ball! Are ferrets so clever they can do this?,3
"This is a great value. I don't use them as puppy training pads--in fact, I don't even have a dog.

Here is how I use them:

As a disposable shower mat
As a shelf liner in my refrigerator anytime I think something will leak or leave a mess
As a liner in my refrigerator crisper
To put my shoes on when they are coated with snow or really wet",5
Good food but one cat won't eat it,3
"My mut of a dog (the one everyone seems to love the most) is the most picky eater ever. She loves many treats but tires of them easily. But, not these twists. She will jump and turn circles when we grab them off the top of the refrigerator. This bag of goodies is a must have in our dog household.",5
"Size wasn't accurate. Returned the item. Seemed like good quality though. My pup measures 15 inches in chest girth, and the measurement was maybe 13-17 girth. But it was way too small on her.",2
The handle is comfortable and the light reflection works pretty well.,5
"It is a good toy for slowing down the pace of your dog's eating, but depending on the size of your dog, you might have to refill it a lot.",4
As advertised.,4
My pup just loves it and it's good for him too.,5
"The instructions aren't the best but, once you figure them out,  the volcano looks great",5
"Our dog is part Husky and Lab and is 11 years old.  She was hit by a car at the age of 2.  She was ok at the time, just scared everybody.  I always wondered about the long term affect of her hip as she smashed in the driver's car door.  She gets stiff with cold weather and rainy days but does alot better with the drops added to her water bowl.  I give 18 drops to 1 gallon of water, everyday.",4
My puppy loves these and they are veggie based.,5
Works just fine in my Drinkwell fountain.,5
Not very sturdy.,2
"Had my German Shepherd on Royal Canin for 7 years. Was happy with it for all that time but recently it wasn't doing the job. After switching her to this her energy is up a great deal and she actually enjoys eating. Have her on a joint supplement so I cant comment on what effects it may have in that aspect. The coat is not as lustrous as it was with RC, but it is noticeably healthy. If you have a dog who gorges, it will have to be used with bowls that slow eating because it is rather a flatter kibble.",5
My Pomeranian has been eating this small breed food for years and she's fit as a fiddle at 8. Good value on Amazon.,5
"I first saw this toy in a store a few months ago and my first thought was that my 11 month old pit bull mix would destroy it quickly (she is a power chewer, btw). Over the past few months, I have found that toys holding treats work very well for my dog, so a few weeks ago, so I decided to try it.  Well, like a previous reviewer stated, I found this toy is more durable than I thought!  Not only does my dog work to get treats out of it, she also will play with it empty, which has been the case for her Kong toys.  It seems to be flexible enough for her to chew continuously, yet tough enough to stand up to her powerful jaws.  In other words, this toy is great as a treat toy and as a chew toy for my dog, justifying its price.",5
"Both of our dogs, Bizzy-Browndog & Chili-Dog, adore these treats.  Even one of our cats, Puddy-Tat (who just celebrated his 18th birthday 5/8/16) loves them too) ~ Puddy actually likes the dog treats better than he does his Lean Treats for Kitties.  My vet once told me it was ok for cats to eat dog food & treats but dogs should  not eat cat food or treats ~ too much fat!",5
"The product I purchased is the 9"" green plant. I wasn't really sure how tall it would be in-tank based on the manufacturer's picture, which makes the leaves look floppy. It was hard to know whether it would be too tall for my tank or whether it would bend in the water to a shorter height. I'm providing pictures to help others see it in-tank. This plant should be used in a tank that's 5+ gallons. It's softening and drooping a bit the longer it stays in the water, but it is a pretty sizeable plant and is stiffer than the picture when it first arrives, so you will need about 9"" in height if you want it fully submerged. The plastic ""tendrils"" around the base of the plant are soft enough to be safe for a betta. Often those random sticky plastic pieces on the base are too hard/sharp for a betta so I was pleased that I didn't have to modify the plant once it arrived. Betta loves it. I love it. No problems with shipping. It arrived in about a week.",5
Did not work at all,1
"I got one of these in white at a big box store for my 4 cats who had no interest in it. As far as what was inside? Stuffing and more stuffing. Barely a pinch of catnip. Not much of a cat toy for the price. So now what?!
I love fancy rats... so I got MYSELF 3 more of these 'cat toys'  from Amazon and repurposed them! I opened them up, removed the catnip & stuffing reset the ears and a few feet, stuffed the heads & tails, gave them whiskers and stitched on facial features, THEN I filled them with flax seed and lavender & hand sewed them shut. Now I can pop them in the microwave (wrapped in a dry towel) for 15-30 seconds on cold days, put them in my coat pockets, or on my neck and have a set of sweet little buddies to give me warm company!! ;)",5
"50 lb shepherd/lab mix started chewing off massive chunks of this within the afternoon.  The Zogoflex toys we bought, however, barely have scratches on them.",1
The air pump is compact and virtually silent! I turned it on and placed it under my cabinet with about 8 feet of airline tubing going up about a 4 foot rise and the bubbles come out plenty strong. You literally cant tell this thing is running unless you get your ear pretty close to it.,5
"Works great at keeping green algae at bay. I transferred the contents to a glass dropped bottle for more accurate dosage and posted a calendar next to the fishtanks to remind us when to add more treatment. So far, so good.",4

"Didn't last very long, but cats loved it while it was going.",5
"I bought this tank at Petco, but figured I'd review on here being a big Amazon customer. This is a really nice tank, and all in all I'm pretty happy with it. There is however no way to adjust the light, so in order to have the filter running the light must be on, which makes its entire purpose redundant for the purpose of either planter or small fish, both of which need some dark time. I've had it for about 2 years though, and the stock light gets you by til you're ready for a custom upgrade.

 The filter comes right out and the pads can be rinsed a couple times before changing. It comes with a great manual too for upkeep. If you have cats, keep the tank out of their reach or this will become their drinking fountain (even of they have their own drinking fountain). It doesn't come with a heater but plenty of room for that. However it's difficult to line to heater and cord through the gap in the lid, so the back of the lid will sit up some from the cord, no big deal.
As everyone else has said, due to the fountain and gap in inner lid, the evaporation rate is ridiculous, losing an inch to two inches a day, so constant refilling is required. However I kind of like this, because it's an alternative for 25-30% weekly water changes.
 I will definitely be buying a larger fluval tank because I'm so happy with this one.",4
Works perfectly on my 10 gallon tank with one of those glass/plastic canopies. So far my animals are healthy and the plants I have are alive and thriving.,5
This is a very cool wave maker. Works great and not a bad price.,5
This is a great harness if you want to keep your dog clearly visible when walking after dark. It works well and is visible for at least a quarter of a mile.,5
I love the scent,5
a cat food that seems to be a favorite with my cats,5
"Our new lab puppy chews just everything she can see in our house!  I bought this spray to stop her destructive behavior.  I have sprayed it on everything she can reach, such as shoes, furniture, and her favorite -- electrical cords.  This spray has worked like a charm so far and stops her from chewing.  She does not seem to like the smell very much, which I believe is tea tree oil.  As for the taste, I can't say if she doesn't like it or not because just the aroma sends her away from off limit items and she does not return to it.",5
"I bought this to use on my German shepherd. I only used it once and did not have any problems.  I did not bath him first as instructed but did brush him very well before I began clipping. I didn't bother watching the entire (boring) video.  I did read and follow instructions on cleaning, oiling and storing the clippers.  I think they will be good for my purposes of clipping him a couple times a year.  They are lightweight the blades look like good quality.  I trust this brand since my husband has used Wahl clippers for years.",4
We bought this for our niece for Christmas. Her dog loves it. I bought  a similar one last year (also for our niece) and that toy has yet to be destroyed. Awesome product. Thx!!,5
We have indoor cats that we take camping so there is the occasional flea that comes inside but this treatment works well.,5
"I highly recommend this product if you have a dog that loves to take you for the walk. Not only does it control your pet, but it trains them to eventually walk by your side. It's a safe alternative to chokers and spike collars. High quality and priced very fair.",5
"Awful...these aren't the same as before and they are expensive. These bags are cheap and very thin. I have two big dogs at home, not very useful for me.",1
"My cats enjoy this food, though no more so than average.  People differ greatly in what they desire for ingredients in a cat food.  I think that this Purina food is better than average in quality of ingredients.  However, do note that grain free isn't the same as low carb.  This food contains carbs in the pea starch and cassava root flour, as well as the dried carrots in contains.

The pieces are a bit bigger but flatter than average.  See the picture I posted for details.",4
Easily replaces old balls that lights have gone out on... or balls that had no lights at all.  My cats love the light up balls!,5
"The collar works - no doubt about that. That's why I gave it 5 stars. However, if I was rating it on safety, it would be 0 stars. The collar is dangerous. I read all the reviews about it getting caught in the cat's jaw, but I stupidly figured it was ""user error,""  and bought one anyway.

It's not user error. It's a careless, negligent manufacturing flaw that should have been fixed long ago. It's stiff, with a horrible buckle, and extremely difficult to adjust after you put it on. It also stretches out pretty quickly.

Your cat WILL get its mouth caught in it eventually. All they have to do is bend their neck down to clean themselves, eat, whatever, and they're caught like a horse with a bit in its mouth.

Once that happens, you're dealing with a panicked, fighting cat. She'll run, and she'll hide, and trying to catch her becomes a battle. Once you catch her, it gets worse.

You probably know what it's like to try and hold a cat just to clip its nails. Add her sheer panic and pain, and then YOUR own panic (and then pain) as you try to pull this stiff, non-breaking collar over her head, or away from her neck long enough to cut it. Done it. Twice. Not fun. And she didn't get over it for days.

I tried a dozen different ways to make it safer - adding elastic, tying the ends to breakaway buckles scrounged from an old collar, but she still got caught. Nothing worked.

But then I finally figured it out.

All you need is a regular safety (breakaway) cat collar, three very thin zip ties, and a pair of scissors.

1) Put the regular collar on your cat and fit it correctly - you shouldn't be able to get more than two fingers between the cat's neck and the collar.

2) Cut the calming collar's ridiculous buckle off and curse it as you send it to Hades. Take the rest of the calming collar and cut it in half (or thirds if you have a small cat) - all you need is enough to go around the front of the cat's neck.

3) Use tiny zip ties to bind the calming collar to the OUTSIDE of the regular collar in at least three places - the middle and at both ends (pictures attached) and with the nubs facing away from her neck so they don't poke her.

4) Cut off the rest of the zip ties as close as you can. I usually file or sand the little nubs left if they're sharp.

This fix solves both major problems with the calming collar,  a) the danger of it getting caught in her mouth, since it now fits correctly and has a true breakaway buckle, and b) the loss of fur and/or irritation of the skin, because there's very little contact with the cat's neck.

On top of all that, you'll save a lot of money because you're able to make at least two collars out of one, since you're cutting it in half or smaller. I actually get six, because my cat is so tiny I had to cut the collar in half lengthwise too to fit the regular collar (see pics). Just keep the extra pieces in a sandwich baggie till you need them so the pheromones stay active.

Hope this helps, because the collar really does work. But I think someone should sue the crap out of Sentry because this collar is so dangerous and they know it. I'm surprised there hasn't been a class action against them considering the number of cats hurt.

If you have any questions, just let me know. Good luck!",5
They stick good and do not fall off. They hold standard size air hose.,5
My dog loves the gravy taste ... Quality product at a good price.,5
Three of the plants have died but the rest are going nuts (I have a Co2 injected tank) Seller worked really well with me to change some plants around to get what i wanted for my tank! Looks great.,4
"Great water bottle. While its insulated, the insulation isn't perfect. It will keep it colder than the non-insulated bottles but there's still a lot of condensation on the outside of the bottle and it only keeps the liquid cooler for so long. The best part of this bottle is the top. It's perfect for the dogs to drink from without having to waste a ton of water like you do with the collapsible bowls. I put it either in a neoprene sling or in my dog's hiking backpack for carrying b/c it's a little large for my little hands to hold easily. Overall, I'm a big fan of this bottle for times out with the dogs.",4
"Love the chunks...well, my dog does anyway.  Can't go wrong with beef.  Amazing deal too!",5
Excellent Price,5
"These pieces are perfect for todays small ""nano tanks"".  The pieces are about 4 inches in 2 or 3 directions- definitely not intended for 5 gallon tanks or larger.  The piece I received is interesting and liked by my aquarium animals.",5
I would not recommend this product.  It did not help my cat at all.,1
"Received this item from Amazon, and immediately put in a return request for it.  The plastic is hard, and I could tell that my dog was going to destroy it within a few minutes.  I received a notice from Amazon that said I could keep the unit at no cost, so I decided to try it out with pup and see if my initial thoughts were wrong.

They weren't.  Within the first treat I shoved into the thing, my 9-month old Australian Cattle Dog ripped away the bubble with the hole in it to get to the treat.  No only was the toy destroyed, but it presented a choking hazard for my dog if he decided to try and swallow the plastic pieces he tore off.

Totally disappointed in this thing (even with it being free), and would not recommend it.",1
"Great deal on a leather collar.  Well made, strong buckles and loops.  It will bleed a little if it gets wet so best to have a nylon back up for rainy days...",3
My dogs are avid rawhide and bullystick chewers.  Thought I'd give this item a try.  My dog had no interest in it whatsoever.,3
"Oh, I love this.  If something were to hold me up from getting home on time, my dog will not be without water. This will be easier to clean and much more sanitary than plastic.",5
"WOW what a surprise! We were told our dog was 50% husky and 50% German Shepherd but her personality didn't seem to go along with that. She also has a spotted tongue and is quite small for those breeds. Turns out, she is 50% Siberian Husky, and 12.5% Belgian Malinois, 12.5% Chow Chow and 25% Mixed Breed! It explains in detail the characteristics of each breed and it definitely describes our dog. The Mixed Breed section even breaks down into groups that are most likely in her DNA, and they were her dad's grandparent, so it doesn't matter as much to us.

We got a discount for $15 off with this purchase, and just bought another one for our other dog! It was well worth the 2 week wait.

NOTE** you have to wait 2 hours after your dog has eaten anything (even a treat) to do the test. We didn't wait long enough the first time and had to have two more swab brushes sent, but it was fast and free so we didn't mind.",5
"I just saw your notice on this item and felt the need to let you know that the item was exactly as described and pictured. It went together perfectly and looks wonderful. Our only issue is teaching our dog to use it! It is strong, well made and I would highly recommend it!

"Well, as you can probably imagine, give a ""kid"" candy (e.g. seeds and nuts) and veggies (e.g., pellets) and which one do you think a smart parrot is going to pick out and eat and then toss the good-for-you-stuff? Yep. That's what happened at my house. My guys have been eating Zupreem pellets for 15 years so I thought I'd try this, and they all went crazy for the nuts and seeds and didn't touch their pellets. Nice concept but didn't work for my parrots. I ended up using this once a week as a treat (but they literally wasted ALL the pellets in there, even though they eat them all week long). Back to dispensing nuts and seeds as training and rewards and not in the food cup.",2
Item as described,4
I've been feeding my Jack Russell Fromm products since he was a puppy.  First time I ordered these.  He loves them.  They are light and crunchy.  Will definitely purchase these again.,5
works well,5

"Great Cat Toy! My 7 cats all love this toy. They will jump in the air and chase it on the ground.

Your cat will thank you",5
"This is a great doggie shampoo.  I'm sure my dogs would agree, too, if only they liked baths.  This liquid smells luscious, although to me, it doesn't have a strong pomegranate smell.  It lathers up nicely, and rinses out well.  The scent lingers a bit, but in a nice way, not in a perfumey, overly-scented way.

I like that the ingredients don't contain some of the harsh ingredients that some dog (and human!) shampoos use, and that it is plant-based.  My dogs don't have any issues that might call for a harsher, medicated shampoo, so this one is perfect for both of them.

After bathing, my dogs' fur feels soft but not greasy or coated.  I don't know if this would sting their eyes because I don't use shampoo on my dogs' faces, just wash their faces and their ears with a soft washcloth.  I'm a fan of this shampoo, and now if I could just get my dogs to be fans of baths, I'd have it made.",5
"My cat loves this thing. I put a little cat nip on it and she goes nuts. This is her go to scratching item, even over the couch! One seems to last about 6 months.",5
"I love this food, but am not sure I will be ordering it through Amazon anymore. It was shipped in a box and the food is very crumby, like the pieces just crumbled in shipping. I bought the biggest bag possible too, so that probably didn't help. If you order smaller, easier to carry bags I'm sure they probably wouldn't be in such bad shape. Or maybe it was just a strange bag of food with a lot of crumbs in it. The world may never know...",5
This dress is just the BEST and looks good on my Poodle .,5
"I brought this directly from PetSmart ...leary because my dog is very dominant and nothing works for his aggressive barking...tried collars, spray etc.
I have had this for 2 days and no barking...he attempts to and then instantly stops.  It's doing what I need it to do while away from home to cease disrupting my neighbor that works from home.  I have not used the handheld the device but once and that was when mail carrier knocked on my door ...my dog is bad at viciously barking when someone knocks or enters...he just likes people to know he's there and in charge!  He stopped instantly too and looked at me and never did again.  The price is only $66 for both and free shipping when you order directly and or pick up in-store.
Worth it - I recommend!!!!!!",5
Going a size up didn't even help. Their size chart is way off. And it's polyester. The fleece lining is merely a thing fleece inside.,1
"I always use OEM foams.  These seem coarser than the ones I used many years ago (10 or so).  Finer foam would filter better, but these still do an OK job.  Perhaps they went coarser, so you could go several months between cleanings, but I'd prefer finer filtration, and having to clean more often.  Why doesn't AquaClear offer fine and coarse foams?  Because they are a little coarse, I only gave 4 stars.",4
"Very Cool. Loves these collars. Can be for dog or kids or adults. Very bright light. Great for a trip to Disney, can help find your kids at night easy.",5
"This works REALLY WELL.  It has helped Missy be much calmer during thunder storms and she is always ready and willing
to have me put it on her.  Highly recommend.",5
"These are probably good for normal sized dogs.  I ordered an XL for my 9-month, 85 lb anatolian shepherd who was in heat.  She is on the high end of the range in terms of weight; and they didn't fit her big bootie.  I had to cut them to get them on her.  She wore them like a thong, so we did get a good laugh. They're also pretty lightweight with minimum velcro.  They are functional though.  I ended up cutting the second pair apart and using it as a pattern to make her a bigger, more substantial pair with wider velcro.  They worked great.  So four stars for being a decent product - but in my opinion, not substantial enough for XL dogs.",4
"This carrier is awesome if you have a pet that likes to see.  There is plenty of meshing on the entire top and both sides, for maximum viewing.",5
Good quality product,5
"I fitted the collar on my white shepherd according to instructions. My shepherd walked fine with it. then I decided to take her leash off at home. Within 20 minutes she had managed to get the nose piece either off or she chewed in half in place.
The item works but for larger dogs I think it needs to be a bit more durable. i will likely modify whats left of the collar so this does not happen again. Also this is partially my fault for allowing my pup to wear the collar unsupervised.",3
I use this food everyday to give my dogs their medications. They never get tired of it. They love the taste. I have been buying it for years. It's the best for my dogs.,5
Matrix is a great product  that works as advertised.,5
Keeps a Border Collie puppy occupied for about 10 minutes ... then it's gone.  Not so sure I want a puppy eating these things like that.,3
"My 7 month, 22 lb, border collie mix went wild for this item.
He loves the scent, and the chew .. this has a nice rubbery feel, which helps with his never ending teething.
The rubbery factor also makes this fun to throw/bounce around..
The job wore off after about a week, but that is partially because he has a ton of toys, and forgot about this one for the moment, if i pick it up he will NEED to have it again.. --
It is also holding up with no issue, no breaks, etc.
I know some other reviewers experienced some issues with destruction, but that does vary from breed to breed, age, size of the pup, and variety of things to play with.. a variety does help keep them from destroying things (not always but often.. soft plush toys are most often the exception no matter the durability claims).",5
"My little dogs (10 and 14lbs) did not enjoy this pad. I gave them treats and belly rubs on it, but they refused to go back unless there was something they liked going on.

It was definitely cool to the touch, but mostly if you put pressure on it. I think my dogs were just too light to really activate the pressure cooling. I sat on it and it was cold, but I can see how it wouldn't work for them, especially because they have dense coats.  The fabric was also sort of plastic-y, so it felt like it could get sweaty since it doesn't breathe.

I wouldn't recommend it for outside use because I don't think it would cool very much in the hot sun.

Overall, it's probably a good idea if (1) your dogs are bigger and (2) less picky than mine.",3
"It took awhile for my cat to decide he liked to use this. At first he ignored it.  Now he sometimes digs the food out even when there is food in his bowl. But overall he does not use it much, even if the bowl is empty or if I put a toy in it.  I was looking for more types of toys so he would not be so bored.",4
"Not only are these collars recycled, they look great too! They are very durable and the bottle opener has been a big hit at parties! The seatbelt buckle is a clever accent.",5
"I originally purchased a vibration collar with 2 shock settings.  The low setting was much higher than I would ever want to use on my dog, so I sent it back and got this collar.

It does have vibrate which doesn't work to train my dog, but the shock settings are awesome!  The settings go from 0-100.  I find that between 20 and 30 work just fine.  At 20, I can barely feel the shock on my finger.  ALWAYS TRY IT ON YOURSELF FIRST by putting one finger across both points.

It is important to have the collar tight enough around the neck or it is inconsistent.  It took me about a week to figure that out.  Once I got the collar just right, it works perfectly every time.

I am extremely pleased with this collar and grateful that is saves me a lot of grief trying to train my dog.  It is also waterproof.  A big thanks to Dogtra!",5
Great for the fish tank,5
"I bought 3 bulbs for my 55 gal aquarium, 48""x 12"" x 18"", they where already germinated with spouts of about 1/2 inch on average, this was a nice surprise, I was expecting them to not have any life to them when i opened the box and looked at the bag, later in the afternoon, Friday 7/22 I put them in the water and because they where dry they floated for about an hour, let them sit for another hour then buried them in the gravel where I wanted them. the following morning I poured in the required plant food and liquid cO2 booster, I have a Finex 24/7 planter+ LED light, which I, my fish and other plants love.
as you can see by the 3 pics i posted, after only 2 days the plants have grown about another 2 or so inches, I don't have a cO2 tank setup or have plant soil and truth be known when it comes to having a green thumb mine is more toward the color black, i am not a gardener by any means, I'll do an update in a few months but i think these plants will look great once they are fully grown.
The package arrived at the early end of the date expected via USPS mail and in great condition.
I would recommend this supplier as a place for your next plant needs.
8/3/2016
Ok, so I said a few months, it's actually less then 3 weeks since receiving my bulbs and buried them in the gravel, This is astonishing, 2 of the 3 plants took off like crazy, (pictured) the one to the back is a couple of inched from my water line which puts it at 16"" and the one closest is about the 12"" mark the third in the middle i would have to guess at normal growth rate, 4 days ago i added a small co2 tank to my aquarium to help my ferns green up, so i don't attribute the growth to this, I'm sure it's just dumb luck i got such great plants but no matter what I'm still very please with the results I'm seeing here.",5
this harness doesn't fit true to size.  I wanted to return for smaller but this company doesn't accept return items.  I now have a harness I cant use.,2
I guess it is working. Simple enough...  But more like drinkable mouth wash.  Guess time will tell.,5
So far so good. It's compact. fit well for my 5 Gallons.,5
"perfect, just wish there logo wasn't there cause I really need to make it a tiny bit smaller, but it is well made",5
Love this comb!,5
"Chewy seemed indifferent to this brand. He would sniff the bowl and then sort of pick at it but not really eat until he was really hungry, which of course meant instead of eating his food he would beg at the table for what we were eating instead. Nothing inherently wrong with the dog food insofar as ingredients. I like the fact that it is grain free and the rest of the ingredients are for the most part ""normal"" food items and not just strings of chemical compounds. He just didn't seem to be real interested in eating it. Maybe it just didn't smell tasty to him.",3
"This is the Second WaterDog I have purchased! Both have FAILED!!!! First one started dripping. Second one replaced under warranty dripped from start. Customer Service from this Canadian Company SUCKS! After many emails and phone calls I had original unit replaced under warranty. Second unit junk also! No replacement repair parts. Save your money and aggravation, stay away, don't purchase!",1
One of the best qulity tiny dog pajamas,5
"You pups will not be fishy to enjoy this squeezable soft fish.  It is fatter than what pic portrays, but is a nice toy to nuzzle , or chew, or toss",4
Something has changed not working anymore.,2
My cat and my puppy love this thing so it's nice to get a break from being their chew toy! Just wish it was a little bigger in terms of diameter!,4
I did not like the fact it was a wire with some cork pieces. My cat thought I had a problem not her. We threw it away. It was not interactive. It was a waste of my money. It was not even worth returning. Never again.,1
My 2 cats are hounding me constantly for more of this canned food. It does look and smells good and one can see the shrimp and fish in the aspic. I hope that I've not created a  bad situation for me. Yikes!,5
Holds the turd in the bag pretty well.,5
"My 15 year old male DSH had been on a raw, forumlated diet since he was diagnosed with recurring diabetes and pancreatitis, as well as arthritis.  The raw diet did amazing things for him and has done really well for the last 5 years.  Now, we are dealing with a UTI that won't give up and struvite crystals in his urine.  He is in pain, so we have him on pain meds and I very reluctantly said I'd put him on the pet's recommended diet that has been formulated for kitties with urinary issues.  The high Ph in his uring is causing his crystals and they insisted he needed a food that would lower the Ph.  Fine, after two visits in 2 weeks, give it to him.  I bought a few cans, and checked the ingredients - knowing full well it would make me sick and then angry.  The first ingredient on the list?  PORK BYPRODUCTS.  I took another look at the can . . . it's a chicken ""flavor"" but made with pork.  How positively disgusting.

Yes, he eats it ... and why woudln't he?  He gets to go to kitty Jack-in-the-Box / McDonald's every night!  It mortifies me every time I open the can. The good news is that I am going to see a veterinary nutritionist that can provide me with a more natural recipe for him that will not exacerbate his diabetes, pancreatitis or newly developed UTI issues. I am lucky that we have somebody around here that can do that for me.  As for the rest of you? What is feeding pork byprodcuts going to do to your cat long-term, and is there something else you could be feeding your cat that is as expensive and exponentially better for it.  (The raw diet I feed mine is as expensive as this canned crap.)

Purina owns these veterinarians from the second tehy start school, and pet nutrition is never a priority in school.  Start thinking for yourselves about what makmes sense for your cat. Because it's not dried food and it certainly isn't chorizo!",2
Awesome,5
It arrived with a lot of dust.,3
"Of course everyone's cats will have different tastes, but my cats love this stuff. I tried buying them all sorts of fancier, possibly ""healthier"" crunchies but they wouldn't eat it. They cry at me to refill their bowl, even when their bowl is half full. One of my cats has learned how to open the bag and tries to get in it whenever the pantry door is left ajar. Amazon prices are cheaper than my local pet stores, and it's delivered right to my house. Will repurchase!",5
"This is a good quality, well designed product",5
Works as expected.,5
Didnt stand up to my lab or beagle. They tote it apart quick but they still love playing with the pieces,4
$10/battery and they last about 3 months. Awful.,1
"been using comfortis, which kills every flea in the neighborhood it seems like. comfortis is prescribed though, which i only resorted to that because 3 or 4 summers ago nothing was working. anyways, glad to report, this summer i used advantix. advantage 2 on the cat. didn't have any troubles, and i applied after a small break out as well. got rid of what we had and kept them off. glad to report!",5
"My dog likes the taste but I think they are a bit too hard for her to chew, I have to break them in half",4
Works well on my dog,5
"I bought this because I didn't want to shave my Lhasa/Shih Tzu mix down to the skin with the #10 that came with my clipper. It gave a nice cut, but not so short that he looks bald.",5
"My dogs love these beds... more than I would have ever expected. They have egg-crate, memory foam and other types of beds around the house and in the SUV. Many of them are 4x the price but both dogs prefer these beds.

First impression: Perhaps too thin as compared to the other types of beds but EXTREMELY soft to the touch. The dogs were un-phased by their thinner appearance and rub their faces on the soft texture all the time.

I haven't washed them in a machine as the reviews indicated that was an issue for some and not so for some other people. I tend to clean them in a Rubbermaid tub with an enzyme cleaner (sink the stink) and air dry. No issues. I used to do rescues regularly (still do occasionally now) and have had many beds over the years. This is a great value so far.",5
Just what I wanted.,5
Pretty good harness.,4
This is a great high quality item. I just love how large this is. My dwarf hamster also loves this. However the seller forgot to drill holes for me to put the ladders in so until I can drill them in myself I have to set the ladders where they go and they aren't very stable. If the holes had been drilled in this would've been an easy five star product. I love all the items Niteangel has for sale! :),3
"Lovely food. My coon is very healthy with this food combination. It seems the food is hard to crack and chew, which seems a little odd for a young cat transitioning from kitten food. But now, even after 10 months, she still loves Royal Canin Formula 31.",5
It is Ok for my Tang so is Ok for me,5
"This is the second and LAST time I will purchase these for my pet.  The pieces in the bag did not look appetizing to begin with.  Looked like the pieces had a lot of dark areas, like they were all from next to boned.  It also seemed greasy when breaking into smaller pieces.
Tried to feed these to my pet 2 different times, thinking maybe the first time she had eaten them too fast or something, but she promptly threw up her stomach contents both time.
This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago.  I don't know what the issue is with this brand, it is supposed to have only 1 ingredient, chicken, in it.  well it must be the crappiest, cheapest, most disease ridden chicken they can find.
I purchase the Life Essentials brand by Cat Man Doo all the time --although they are for cats and come in much smaller bag-- these have NEVER EVER made my pet sick.  NEVER!

Do not buy these.  This is so upsetting to have my pet sickened in this way by something that is supposed to be a TREAT.  HAH!",1
See vimeo com website # 102959301 for catastrophic failure in crash testing of this harness,1
"This cat nail clipper seems to be well made. I used them on both my cats and they worked very smoothly. The 19 lb male cat has nails like a dog - very thick & tough to clip. His blunt, thick nails clipped off easily. The 10 lb female has very thin, scimitar-like nails which clipped off smoothly & easily. So far, so good based on 1 session and I hope they keep their edge.",4
"These pads are amazing!! I so wish I had found them years ago. Have spent a small fortune on the pee pads that always seem to leak if your pup doesn't hit it dead center. I swear, I washed the floor at least once a day every day. Now it's only a couple times a week. They come in a 2 pack so when one is in the wash you have a back up! Even my dog loves it because Mom doesn't growl when he misses the pad haha! Best thing I've bought all year for myself!",5
Great way to find out which one my parrots like best !,5
Great bird cage can't beat the price.,5
"I read the other reviews before buying this-- not like it was a big purchase- but in all reality we do not need more cat toys that are not being played with laying around!!
I have 2 older cats who get bored easily and will play longer with things that aren't even toys-- wrappers-etc
Well immediately when this came out of the package they knew it was for them and they cannot get enough and even play with it by themselves-- wire and cardboard how simple!! but the cats sure do love it--",5
Perfect for our 1 yr old tortoise. He finally doesnt get stuck like the other dishes!,5
Better than I even thought it would be. I will be buying more! I have five dogs and they ALL love it. It is soooo soft!!,5
Standby for nursing moms & pups.,4
"My fussy cat, who only likes to eat gravy, ate a little of this and then walked away from most of it in her bowl. It's really more of a bisque than gravy. But, you do get quite a bit more in the pouch than you do with the Delectables Lickable Treats.",3
"Fits my 7 pound Yorkie perfectly, looks adorable on her.",5
"Smaller than expected, but if you have to use that often then that's another story. Worked like a charm and a must have for your grooming bag!",5
Hamster likes to just sit inside!,5
"While I love this company's other products and my cats do too, all 5 refuse to eat this food.  I don't switch brands often and none of them are picky eaters.  Also, I transitioned them from Organix Healthy Adult Cat Food over the course of two weeks, and 4 out of 5 still had major digestive upset.  The pieces of kibble are tiny and the small amount they did eat took a very long time.",2
This is probably our puppy's favorite toy.  Both ends of the fox have a squeaker in it which makes for double the fun.  So far the product seems to hold up well,5
"Loved the ease of cleaning with this sifting litter box but it is just too small for my grown cats.  I was always cleaning up litter off the floor since it has such short sides and front.  I did however end up purchasing a larger one (CP77) and it works great. Real high sides - very little clean up outside the box, I do not use the hood that comes with it since the cats could not get use to it.",4
my toby  loves and so do all his frineds,5
- a favorite [smelly] food of our 4 cats.,4
"I bought about 20 packs of these, but towards the 15th pack I realized that these are made for dogs less than 16 or so pounds. My 20 dog proceeded 4 months ago to try and chew it 5 or 6 times, and then swallow it. He got it lodged in his throat, and I always kept a close watch ever since. a month ago was the last straw. I saw him do the same thing, so I am now stopping all use of these bones. I do not recommend them if you have a medium size dog since they can choke on these since they are small. The package gives you this warning. I am giving it a 5 anyway because he LOVED them. I now buy the combo pack of 2 + 2 of the larger ones, and he loves them too. I just wish the larger ones had a cheese flavor, but he doesn't really mind.",5
Excellent product! Dog loves them and I think by having those on hand it prevents her from chewing things she should not chew in the house!,5
helped,5
dogs like it okay.  i wonder about the dye in it?,3
"Amazing for my large dog who pulls when leashed. It has changed her behavior so much! Takes some getting used to, but my dog tolerates it fine.",5
"My picky dogs love this food and I like it because it's grain free.

No eye staining, no itchies.  It's all good.",5
"My cats love this!. The kibble is small, like pea sized. Perfect for old cats that don't have many teeth left.

The bag has a new zipper that is almost like Velcro. It's awesome, keeps the bag shut tight.",5
"We love these for our toy poodle. The last batch after it was opened developed BUGS inside the package.  I get our home sprayed every 3 months and have been using the same company for 30 years and they had just sprayed the week before. I have several packages of chews, treats and other pet products in the same closet but none of those have gotten bugs inside the packages. I froze the product inside another bag, now what do I do?.",1
Great refill cartridge if you want to add your own media to a Penguin biowheel. Durable. Chambers inside keep the media evenly distributed. Fits perfectly. I use mine for Peat balls when I need to lower the pH or soften the water.,5
"For some reason the dinosaur nylabones are my dogs favorite.  They have other nylabones, but their favorites are the dinosaur shaped one.",5
Very happy as usual. I will continue to order from Aquatic Arts.,5
"My dog's nails are very thick. Even with these, it was still hard to cut her nails, but still better than previously owned ones.",4
"EACH 1.69 OZ BOTTLE (50ML) TREATS 100 GALLONS. DIRECTIONS ARE: 7 DROPS PER GALLON OR ONE CAPFUL (5ML) FOR 10 GALLONS. I PREFER THIS PRODUCT OVER ANOTHER WATER CONDITIONER BECAUSE IT GIVES DIRECTIONS TO TREAT EACH GALLON, HELPFUL FOR SMALLER BETTA TANKS OR PARTIAL WATER CHANGES IN OTHER SMALL TANKS.",5
"I read multiple reviews saying that after a period of time in the aquarium, the paint starts coming off. So, I sprayed mine with clear spray paint. I gave it multiple coats and waited about ten days before I put it in my aquarium. I waited until I could no longer smell the paint, and it didn't have that 'just painted' feel to it.  So far, so good. I will update this review in a few months.",5
dogs love it. but it crumbles quickly and its hard to feed the dog as a solid bite.. they may have to lick it off your hand sometimes.,3
Put them on my cats. They had them unsnapped in less than 24 hours during which they never left the room. Pretty much useless.,2
"This is tough enough for my miniature English Bull Terrier. He tears the red Kongs up fairly easily. However, it's much harder to get him interested in playing with it. It's almost too stiff. If he played fetch it would be great, but it's too awkward for the games he likes (too small to tug, to stiff to mouth). However, I'm assuming most people buy it because it's tough, and that it is. I fill it with natural peanut butter or Greek yogurt, freeze it and leave it with him when he's home alone because I know he won't tear it up and eat the pieces.",5
This food got really high ratings on the Dog Food Advisor.  My dogs like it and their coats are shiny.  This is a quality food.,5
Cats were afraid of the noise it made had to return it the return was good,1
"Great product for the price, my cat loves it!",4
My dog and I love these east dog toy EVER,5
"I can honestly tell everyone that these were the hardest booties, for me, to get on a dog.  My dogs are use to me putting booties on them before we walk in the winter months but these took so long to get on and were so frustrating.  They patiently waited for me to get them on, so if your dog won't patiently wait, then you are not going to get them on! as soon as they stood up, one or more had already fallen off.
The best booties, hands down, are the ones that look like balloons, they may not keep their feet as warm, but they keep the snow, salt, ice or whatever else from getting onto their feet.  They are rubber, so they still get traction and actually leave their pawprints in the snow.",2
"seems not very accurate sometimes. just be careful, and just tempreture as often",3
"I will start by saying I am not huge on giving dog treats, but there are times it is handy to have treats on hand, in order to tempt a dog to do something it otherwise isn't that enthusiastic about doing (like staying home when he wants to go with me).  So, when I do feed, treats, I want them to be good quality, since I also feed a good quality food.  These treats are a chicken jerky.  They're human grade and contain only three ingredients - chicken, celery juice and salt. They are made in a US facility that makes cereal and other human foods so it meets all inspection requirements. The jerky is made using cage free, antibiotic free chickens, which I must admit I take a little bit with a grain of salt since I know those labels often do not mean the chicken is actually kept in humane conditions, though it certainly sounds good and is better than the alternative.  However I would guess that the chicken used is still the bits and pieces of the chicken that cannot be turned into human food.  My dog likes them and it does make him happier about staying home when he has to and I feel better knowing what he is eating is still good for him.",5
Good quality dog food.,5
we bought two for each of our dogs. Two different sizes. Well made. Washes easily and comes out looking new.,5
"recently changed foods and love this stuff better. it makes his poop less smelly and he stinks less in general. i think the food is softer also, so its easier for him to eat. definitely my new favorite brand for him.",5
"I've owned several different type of cat nail clippers but I find these to work the best. They are not too stiff, they open and close easily and that's important when you are trying to be quick",5
"My babies are and always will be Weruva babies. It makes me happy that I don't even need to look at ingredients with this company (I still do anyway) to know that it's good stuff. The only one my cats don't like is Kitty Gone Wild... and I have no idea why, but they love every other type!",5
Super cute! Medium is a little snug for an 18 pound dog.,5
"A good product, however my hands, washcloth, and q tips work just as good.",3
Far better fit and comfort than Gentle Leader halter. Padded nose band is much more comfortable for our dane.,5
"at first glance when I got it, it looked sturdy and really nice. I've had it about 5 days now and the pink part is scratched and pitted. The back is severely scratched. My do is an indoor dog and get moderate activity. She is kenneled during the day so she is not rough. kind of disappointed in the quality.",2
"My terrier, Sam, loves this toy. He carries it around the house with him. There is a groove inside where you can place treats and this will keep him occupied until he gets the very last one out. The material it is made of is pliable and indestructible.",5
This is just great!!! Now we can walk outside in the rain together. Bye bye wee wee pads,4

I have to say that I as a little worried when I first got it. I know that the different color toys mean the different thicknesses and such and so I usually try and get my large breed shepherd/pit mix dog the black ones which are the hardest and most durable. I was worried this one would not hold up to his roughness, but we have had it for a while now and he has barely even put a dent in the thing! He and my fiance play with this all the time and they play VERY rough, he chews it, and they pull and tug side to side, still it is holding up great. Definitely worth the money for these durable toys, and a better price than you can find in any store!

~Thanx~",5
"Our puppy was 3 months old when we got this and she was hitting the bell in two days.  She doesn't always hit it or we may not hear her do it, then she will yip if we don't come quickly.  The part that fits over the door knob is a little wide for ours and the loop part was too big so I sewed it to make it smaller smaller so it doesn't slip off now",4
"Finally found out what my shelter-adopted dog has in his heritage. I'd recommend this to others that are curious about their dog's breeds. It was fun and informative. It's nice to finally know where he gets some of his unusual traits, now that I've looked up his breeds I can see clearly what he got from each. And by the way, the animal shelter and veterinarians were wrong about what breeds he had, hahaha! Though they were close. :)",5
my cat eats it so it must be ok!,5
"As a trainer, I do use these occasionally when I have a client with a difficult-to-control dog.  This is the best head halter on the market.  Here's what I say about it in my dog-training blog: http://janthedogtalker.blogspot.com/2010/06/head-halters-for-difficult-to-control.html",4
Works well for the lab. Is a decent price,5
"Doesnt come with a string to hang it up, the wood decorations were off of the cube when it arrived, other than that its okay.",3
This is the only brand of this type of product I use and I wouldn't consider switching brands.  Gets out the carpet stains and urine odor from our 22 year old cat!,5
"Great product, but if you have a smaller tank, I would recommend getting a smaller volume (Prime, 50 mL). You need very little for new tanks and tank changes and this bottle is difficult to get the right volume due to its size. This is a fantastic product for fish, we used it during our initial nitrogen cycling and it worked great with our mollies and catfish.",5
As advertised! Fresh product that works well.,5
Good,5
"I purchased this throw with the sole intent of covering my couch and preventing ""accidents"". While the throw looks nice and is soft, it is NOT waterproof as advertised. I placed a small amount of water on it when I became suspicious that it really wasn't waterproof and sure enough, the water soaked completely through when placed on top of the throw. I even placed water on the rubber backing and it soaked through on that side as well. The reason it leaks is the decorative stitching on the throw. The stitches create small holes and liquid can seep through them.
So in summary, if you want a nice throw for your pet that is soft, warm, and comfortable, this is a good product (which is why I'm giving it 3 stars). However, if you are purchasing it with the goal to prevent liquids from getting onto your couch, this is definitely not the product to purchase.",3
Cat loves them,5
"I have been looking for a vitamin for my dogs that they would like. This is the ONE!  My dogs are soo fussy about what they eat. But I have no problem at all giving them these vitamins. They come running when I tell them it's time for their vitamins. I am so happy with this product. And they were approved by my vet, too!!!",5
They are not indestructible by any means buy these harnesses are a great value for the money. I have bought several in the last few months for my two 65 pound boys. Make sure you measure before purchasing... My boys require XXL at only 65 pounds.,5
Cat loves these treats!,5
My pug lays on this bed all day long. It is very comfortable and soft yet has support. I would recommend this for dogs with leg or hip problems. I believe it helps.,5
This jar is perfect for small to medium dog treats and all cat treats. The top unscrews to you can dump a lot of treats into it or clean it easily....then it just flips open for quick easy treat giving.  Has a great seal to keep contents nice and fresh.  Love the paw prints on the outside also.  Really a great product for holding those treats and it's attractive enough you can keep on countertop with peace of mind that the pets can's get it open in the event they try!!!,5
I have had this over six months. Still not tore up. Dog loves it. I wash and dry it when it gets to nasty.,5
"Got this when we adopted our pup as we weren't sure what kind of walker he would be. He was abused before we got him and has many scars on his neck so collars aren't really an option for him. He LOVES this harness. The handle on the back was great for when we first got him and weren't sure how he would react to other people/dogs on the street and now it is just a convenient place to tie extra poo bags when we're out walking. We have seen multiple people at the dog park get their dogs this same harness after seeing how much our dog loves his and asking us where we got it. Seems very well made, we've had it for 4 months now and are hardly seeing any wear and tear.",5
"Got this for our 2015 F150 extended cab.  Fits the back cab perfectly.  Wish It was 6"" longer but it is what it is.  My dog is an idiot and she insists on standing up the entire ride, I know reviews said their dogs slide around, I haven't had that issue.  Love the slits for a seat belt to fit through, keeps The Kraken in the back where she should be not trying to drive.

My pup also had a UTI at one point which meant she peed on everything including the back seat. It just puddled right up, didn't leak through and cleaned up the mess easily without damage to the truck.

Very fast in/out so if I need to transport humans or hose off the hammock it's easy to remove.",5
This has been the exact thing that I have been looking for!!  With the two different settings you can pretty much set it up as you want.  LOVE IT,5
"A great little 5 gallon for small space. Only thing is filter is very strong, found my betta stuck to intake.  Modified by glueing sponge to slow flow into intake and only cycle his water twice daily for about 10 min each time.  Love the tank, got it on sale ($42.00) and will buy again for work .",5
Buying a great product AND doing good.  A great combination!,5
Dog loves it,5
This is a nice harness and very well made.  It is a little snug to get over my dogs head and around her neck with no adjustable strap.  The strap around her body is adjustable.  A person may want to purchase the next size larger just to make sure it will fit over the head and around the neck.,4
"* This product far exceeded my expectations. The fit was good, the quality was excellent and it installed in 2 minutes.",5
My cats like it,5
"The reason for the tiny brush within the handle became more apparent as I had to clean Florence's fountain.  It's not absolutely necessary, but it's nice to have a tool that does what it's supposed to.",4
"These are great hardy toys. Our pups are strong chewers and the interior ""crackle"" plastic wears out well before the exterior. I always appreciate hearing the crackle instead of high pitched squeaks when they play. It's unfortunate that you can't select a color on Amazon since my boys keep getting pink ones.",5
"We got this as a travel bed for our dog, and when at home we lie it over our dogs coolaroo bed (I know, it kind of invalidates the point, but it's still so much more clean than a pile of fluff for a huge dog to lay on). Our dog really likes it! The plus side is that it is easy to transport, so I can take it to work with me when my pup goes. The downside is that it's white and dirties easy. I haven't washed it so I'm not sure how it would hold up.",4
Dogs love it and haven't torn it up.  Had 2 labs playing tug of war with it several times and it survived!,5
"Great Smell, Great Feeling",5
"This is a great buy for the money, easy to use. The best part is the dog steps right in, no confusing straps.",5
"Works great, fits great",5
It's the only shampoo my pomeranian uses. She loves the scent! She uses it with the kiwi conditioner and I just blow dry her and no tangles.,5
a little big,3
WAY better than expected.  They work SO very good.  Highly recommend.,5
The material looks to be of high quality.  Definitely comfy - for humans too... while it's clean anyway.  My dog likes it certainly.  Probably the only surprise was the thickness.  It's about 5 or 6 inches.  I expected the width to be a bit more but it's not a problem because the cushion is legit.,5
We just started using it and so far so good. The material is fabric rather than vinyl or plastic which keeps the dog from slipping. It fits the back seat well and the holes work for the seatbelts. My do does not seem interested in chewing this one like he did with two others so whatever it is made out of does not attract him which is great.,5
"I use this for my Australian Shepherd puppies, this is a life saver.",5
I love this bowl.  My dogs no longer gobble their food.,5
My puppy could tell the difference between real grass and fake grass. She didn't want anything to do with it.,1
"I rated it good because its made well, packaged nice and came fast but my cats avoid it like the plague :(

Maybe I will start tossing more Cat Nip inside as that's when they will entertain this product.
Cant be critical because some peoples cats love it so maybe its just my cats idk
Rated it for quality etc.

The material seems well made and just wanted to update, my cats seem to be using it more now that some time has passed.
I also wedged it in a cracked door giving them the incentive of using it and while it works sometimes they choose to jump over it instead :)
The male cat in the family loves the smaller one quite a bit.",4
my cats love this (especially since i added the cover) and so do i. no more litter odor. yeah!!!!!!!!,5
Destroyed in 2 days. Just buy regular tennis balls if you have something bigger than a 10# Dachshund.,1
My dog destroyed this product in a matter of minutes. ',1
Purchased this playpen for my 1.8  pound chihuahua.  She is now 5 pds and she still loves it.  I have had no problems with her getting out of it and has helped with the potty training.  Love it and would recommend to anyone with a puppy or small dog.,5
This was a hit with the Hens.  The only problem is that they eat it too fast.  Oh well we will just have to buy more!,5
"Ours was not usable due to manufacturing errors. The straps were put on it upside down and without a way to attach, making it impossible to install.",1
"I'm not a ""supplement/vitamin"" person, but my vet recommended this to me long ago and I've kept on using it.  Its expensive, but when it comes to one's animals............",5
a bargain,5
My experience with all Puppia products has been good. You pay a little more for quality.,5
My cat doesn't really ever touch this toy.,2
Received in no time and was packed beautifully we use this on rugs and fog bedding. No fleas in this house,5
"My dog, Zoey, fully approves and appreciates this launcher.  I can throw the ball even farther for her now and that is a winner in her book.",5
The only Rawhide my dog will chew on. He loves them.,5
Ordered two. Both are perfect!,5
"These are pretty durable and my puppy loves them! With other tennis balls, she literally destroys them within an hour, but she hasn't done that with these!",5
Cheaper then pet stores around me. I have two cats and this lasts almost two months. They enjoy eating the food and I will be buying again.,5
conure didn't like it,1
"Petunia, my 45 Lb American Bull Dog loves it.
Took her 3 hours to get one of the sides out, replaced it and she's back to playing with it.

No other bone or chew toy has been this ""ever lasting"" and held her attention as well as this one.

Be sure to buy a size larger then you think your dog needs. When it's a little large it's harder for them to get to the treat.",5
"dogs love it, priced right",5
Gave it as a requested gift to a friend.  She reports it worked very well.,5
Adorable to see the kitty playing in it!,5
My dogs love this food.,5
My bunny LOVES this stuff!!!!,5
Arrived with no sound,2
"this food is great but I suggest you just buy one can first, too make sure your dog likes it. (because it is expensive, but... your dog is worth it",5
"My dogs love them, I love that they love them along with being great for their bones.  Too bad they don't last!!!  Need bigger bag.",5
Wow even better than I expected this holds up pretty good to my teacup Yorkie he doesn't climb he can hardly jump up so I don't have any trouble with him trying to escape plus it was easy to set up took my fianc 15 minutes to do it I like that it has a double latch on the door for extra security I got the gray color which is fantastic my fur baby max loves it ,5
Great size for an 11month old 80lb German Shepherd. Hasn't destroyed it yet!,5
dog got used to this very quickly. and doesnt mind it at all. his pitbull nails are big and tough so if i don't keep up with it it takes a while,5
Made all three of our dogs sick with diarrhea and vomiting. Can return item for some reason and stuck with this giant bag I have to throw away. What a waste of money. We've tried many other brands and had no issues. EVERYTIME we've tried these treats they sick. these are expensive and we were not able to get a refund. waste money and sad my babies got sick.,1
Must have this cleanser.,5
Shock was very poor. Wouldn't even budge my Dane puppy.,1
"Its OK, but not strong enough for 6 month old bloodhound puppy. I need to exchange it.",3
"Just a heads up, I've tried ordering two of these beds, one green and one tan, and they are NOT 15x15x17, they are 14x14x15 and it's just too small for my little dog. Otherwise it's attractive and well made.",2
Great soap bar does wonderful for my husky Shepard mix who has lots of skin problems has helped with her itching and the bald spots she had are growing back nicely now.,5
my bunny was eating oxbow hay sometimes the hay was good other times like powder and brown. I decided to give small pet select a try and i am glad I did. My bunny loves this hay. I have never seen him so excited to eat hay before. The hay is high quality is nice and green and smells fresh. Also is a good price. I have no complaints about this hay...,5
Much better than the other brand.,5
ok,3
"My dog is allergic to fleas.  We've had a problem with fleas recently.  When she is wearing the Thundershirt, she can resist scratching the places where she was bitten.  I sewed a metal loop onto the Thundershirt so that I don't have to use a collar when she is wearing the Thundershirt.",5
Works great easy to read,5
"These rings are really soft, and break in half easily when bent. My dog can chew the ring off in minutes, which totally defeats the purpose of keeping her occupied. I'm pretty disappointed, but she does enjoy the two minutes she has with them.",2
Really good and the kitten thinks I'm petting him,4
"Love it for my cat, who has a hairball problem.  Too bad it's been discontinued.",5
My go-to purchase for both reptiles and baby parrots! The heat mats are reliable and offered at a great price!,5
"I've been feeding it for a long time mixed 3/4 - 1/4 with Costco turkey kibble to cut the cost since I'm feeding 7 40-50lb dogs and 2 livestock guardian dogs pushing 100lb. The dogs coats are good, stool is well formed and the food bill is doable. I've tried all the different flavors and the dogs seem to like this the best.",5
"cats go nuts, refillable with catnip(included) how ever stay away from HARTZ brand catnip cats hate it, use the tube with the catnip in it to use to refill in the future u can't go wrong, a must buy for any cat lover!",5
"I have been giving these to my dog for a month now. I can definitely see more ""pep in his step"" and he seems to not be feeling the pain of every move. I will continue to buy and use these tabs. Work great! And he LOVES the flavor of them...so no hassle of force feeding anything!",5
"Our 16-pound cat who hasn't played with any other toy we've bought for her, enjoys this toy. She actually jumps off the ground to grab it! We still have to entice her, and she only plays for a short time, but it's better than nothing! It's nice that its retractable & easy to store.",5
"they always go after the toy.  In fact, it was called ""the forbidden toy""and I had a hard time finding them.",5
"We have multiple dogs, and half of them take daily supplements.  We use a lot of pill pockets, and our dogs definitely have their favorite flavors.  They're not big fans of the hickory smoke, which seems to have replaced the beef.  (poor substitute)  Their second favorite is peanut butter.  When I found the beef on line, I bought several packages.",4
"After reading lots of reviews, I chose this pet feeder.  It has been in continual use for about 2 months and has worked perfectly.  I highly recommend to any one who wants to automate their pets' feeding while at home or away.",5
These stairs are easy to put together and seem very sturdy. They are great for small animals. Definitely worth the price!,5
doesn't smell the greatest bt works wonders my dog is 8 an allergic to fleas this helped her in less then 24hours,5
"I've used K-9 Power products for years. The chicken based meal makes kibble tastier and can add weight as well as a beautiful coat. Be sure to start them off with a small amount if they have sensitive stomachs.
It was impossible to find for awhile. I hope it is now back in full force.",5
for some reason this doesn't connect to the socket....,3
I just bought this harness in extra small for my 4 pound Yorky puppy. It fits him perfectly. We had a regular harness for him which was slightly large and it really bothered him. He barely notices this one at all.,4
excellent product,5
"This is a truly awesome warming mat for cats, dogs or small animals. I now own three of them to keep my feral cat outdoor shelters warm in the winter. These mats are well made, easy to keep clean and comfortable to boot. My ferals were toasty warm during last winters below freezing temps.
I also own a smaller one for my indoor rescue cat who is about nine yrs old who refuses to sit anywhere else!
You simply cannot go wrong with this mat, because a warm comfortable pet.....is a happy pet!",5
Cute costume.,5
"Great decoration if you are creating a spongebob themed aquarium. I don't feel any sharp edges on mine as some others have mentioned. When I put this in the tank it would barely stay down and would float. The method I found to make it stable is to remove it from the aquarium and then place it back in upside down first, then flip it over in the water and it will stay in place perfectly.",5
"I like this product I will recommend it to my friends and family, good quality and the delivery was fast.  not expensive",5
"An absolutely beautiful collar for dogs with longer necks. It is wider than most collars and not something I'll let my girl wear on a daily basis, keeping it mainly for going out... but boy does it dazzle when I put it on her.  She has sleek shiny black fur and the silver collar just sets it off perfectly.",5
"My dog just loves this food. Meat only, no grain. Perfect.",5
With 3 dogs who have lots of fur and deep ears this product seems to work well.,4
"The best heaters out there. Bigger than other brands... Wish they were a bit more compact on the lower wattage versions, but I've never had one fail and they seem the most accurate in locking in your desired temp setting of several brands I've had.",5
"Didn't even take it out of the display packaging before I decided it had to go back.  The clasp is made of poor quality and is too small.  I only tried to pinch it open once and it was already being fussy.  I was hoping the previous review (where the clasp would not unclip) was just the result of a defective one.  I guess I should have listened (but it is no sweat, because amazon will refund my money and I'll be able to put it towards a more quality collar that will probably cost a little more).",1
Bought for my eight pound Chihuahua and it works very nice so far!,4
"We have bought two of these this winter. Not because of problems, but because they are awesome. We have about 15-20 homeless cats in our neighborhood... and refuse to let them go hungry, or thirsty.. Anyway, we have had frigid temps this winter. -30 to -40 degrees.. The water has frozen over a few times, in the deepest cold nights... It has kept the water thawed up until then, and still does. It stays thawed until at least -20. Our neighborhood kitties are very thankful, as are we",5
"I was asked to review this product at NO COST to me and I am glad I was. I have a bullie, which is a pitbull/bulldog mix so his hair is short and while the dog side doesnt really work for him the cat side is great for him and any dog really with a short coat of hair. Not only is it super easy and comfy for me to use he loves it and is always willing to be brushed.",5
It calms my cat down.,5
"Ingenious bag holder. You put a roll of pickup bags in through the top zipper, then draw them out one by one though a side opening. Straps with Velcro attach to your leash handle easily.",4
Dog loves it!,5
My German Shepherd and Great Dane love this thing.  Nice and sturdy.  It does the job.,5
Our dogs love them...it's their favorite treat. Not greasy and actually smell good.,5
"Great, works for barking and other behavior.  I took it to the dog park and when things starting getting a little out of line, it worked to redirect the dogs' behavior.",5
Didn't work with my kitty BooHoo,1
Too cute! Tough too.,5
this drives my German Shepherd crazy he loves this. very durable,5
"It's Okay, but not any better than any other liquid meant for eye stains.  It doesn't actually remove the stain, though it might lighten a bit.  It acts more like a liquid antibiotic that saturates the hair so the powder can be applied.  You will use the powder more.  If you want this product, and the area is small or a streak of stain, use a Q-tip as your applicator to keep from wasting it.  Only use a pad or cotton ball if you have a large area.  Does not hurt if you get a bit in the eye itself, but be careful.",3
I purchased this in March in anticipation of the usual high flea infestations that usually begins here in late April. This product will kill fleas...but it isn't a long lasting solution. If you have a indoor dog that only occasionally ventures outsides to do its buisness then you'll probably be ok with the product. BUT still check your pet in case a flea or two hopped upon it because the fleas will begin to infest if not sorayed again immediately. It doesn't work like the 30 day long lasting products. This is spray as needed and when necessary to stop a outbreak on your pet and in tour house.,2
My dog likes these and they help keep her teeth clean.,5
Much too big for a dog with 16 inch neck. Has to be doubled which makes it bulky.,3
The bag was larger then I expected! Great size bag of treats for a great price! My dogs love these,5
This is a great harness. The straps are thick so it is easy on the ribs and easy to slip on. Love it,5
I got this to replace the sponge in my filter it has been 2 years they last forever! They clean amazing too. I really can't say enough about these,5
"Like many reviewers, I was really surprised by the way this inexpensive, simple toy makes my 2 cats go berserk! They LOVE it! Heeding other reviewers' comments about safety, I am careful about using it and don't leave it out for them to play with unsupervised. I even put a little duct tape on the metal ends just in case. I keep it in my closet and each morning as I get ready for work, my cats eagerly await the time I brush my teeth, because that is when I play with them with this toy. My one cat runs to the closet door when he hears me start brushing and the other one comes around too. They jump and pounce and stalk and chase. My younger cat does backflips and even my fat cat will jump at it, so it is great exercise for them! My cats have many other more expensive toys but this little thing is by FAR their favourite. Santa Cat gave it to them at Christmas and it lasted about 3 months with daily play (the cardboard pieces got too chewed up) so I got a new one. Awesome toy!",5
Purchased for my parakeet & he loves it.,5
"An entertaining toy with soft, colorful wood rings for the birds to chew.  My concern about the toy though, is the large bell that hangs in the middle of the chain.  A smaller bell would enable the bird to get as close to the wood rings as he wants without getting startled.  (Cockatiels startle easily.)  This would probably be a good toy for a Quaker parakeet or a Sun Conure.",3
Good,5
The besy cat toy ever! My kitty gets a lot of exercise now!,5
Birds like,5
"My 10-year-old Standard Poodle loves this formula and so do I!  After putting it into her food, she becomes much more interested in eating.  Obviously, there are vitamins/minerals in this which she needs.  This is about the fourth time I have used it and will continue, as her coat is shiny and she has tons of energy.",5
This is a great item to have for large dogs since it keeps them from having to bend to the floor when eating and/or drinking.  Great item!,5
"Nothing special, it works very well and will handle a large size cat very well (our cat is 14 pounds)",3
all good,5
"Works perfectly, does exactly what it should do. My dwarf hammy Alice decided she liked it better as a bedroom but that's beside the point!",5
Nice thick antler. Our dog loves it!,5
Dog and cat both love it.,5
Light output was fantastic to replace the stock light with an Aqua8 system. The cord doesn't stay in the box very well; as long as it is connected to the timer it is okay; but it could fit a little tighter. If the cleaning people in my office bump the cables with the vaccuum the light doesn't turn on anymore.,4
"Does the job pretty well, quality brushes still holding their own after a couple years of use. I was hoping these brushes would be all I need to clean my fountain and the small parts of the pump, but it doesn't reach into the tiny crevices so I still need to use a qtip to really clean some parts.",4
"I have had this item for a year now and I am quite pleased with it.  It works fine, it shipped fine.  The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is that for some reason the steps have a tiny slope towards the front of the steps which has no discernible benefit and seems to cause a little extra effort on the part of my 20 year old cat.  However, since I generally find that I have much to say about products not working, when I find one that does I want to acknowledge it!",4
I love it I think I would like it even more if it was shorter..I think it is 8ft....but it is beautiful!!!,4
I have two bowls like this for feeding my dogs.  Also have a plastic jumbo size for feeding my outside cats.  Usually works really well to prevent ants.  Do not let grass or anything touch the side of the bowl or the ants can climb up that and get in.,4
This has been passed on to another puppy.  Napoleon has an electronic fence now but this worked out fine prior to the fence. Another way to let your pet feel independent.,5
"My cat did not figure it out despite using cat nip and toys to lure her to scratch on it. She would just rub her head against it, sit on it, and lay on it. My grandmothers cats love it, however, and figured it out right away, scratching it 5 times in an hour span! So I guess it just depends on the cat!",3
Very good deal on this proven product,5
Great product!!!,5
Fit as expected!,5
"I've had this litter box for a little over 2 years so I figure now is a good time to share my findings.

Its held up very well in the two years that my cats have been using it. They seem to prefer this one over others, probably because it's more spacious. It conceals smells pretty well in my opinion too. The best feature of the box by far is that you can clean it without taking it apart which makes scooping easier and faster. The price is pretty good too for a huge box.",5
"this litter is the best...it lasts longer and with little odor when used our sphynx poo smells so bad but this litter masks the terrible odor for quite a while b4 i can flush it down the loo. I'm never switching unless Dr. Elsie comes up with a lightweight type of litter, thanks Dr. Elsie...",5
"Great clipper for small dogs, birds, or any little creature.  Nice and sharp with a rubber like coating on handles which makes it comfortable to hold.  I would buy again!",4
Our Great Pyrenees loves this food.,5
We have a corgi and have purchased these bags twice.  Each set lasts for a year.  We have had no problems with these bags.  They work perfectly for their purpose. Buying them this way is way less expensive then buying them at the store.,5
"I was looking for a dog collar that could be used every day but also had the ability to tighten if I grabbed it to keep the dogs from running away. Most dog collars have to be kept somewhat loose. If you grab the collar or use it with a leash, the collar will often slip over the dogs ears.

This collar works to allow it to tighten when you pull on it but loosens immediately. It won't slip over the dogs ears if you use it with the tether. Also, it's very friendly to the dog in that it doesn't hurt their neck and it doesn't get so tight as to cause them to choke. It's a gentle reminder to not pull on the leash.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that there is no specific place to put the ID tag. There is a ring that can be used for the attachment of the ID tag, but this is also for attachment of a leash or tether. It would be nice if they had added another small plastic buckle to allow for the ID tag and the dog license tag.

And is been noted by many others, never leave your dog outside on the tether unattended. Only use a tether if you're able to watch the dog or be there with him. In my opinion, leaving the dog on the tether unattended and outside is animal cruelty.",4
"My dog loves this.  She is a basset hound so her fur is short but she does shed a lot.  Unlike many combs and brushes, she thoroughly enjoys this.  She rolls around so you get all the spots - she acts like she is getting a massage.  She's happy and I'm happy.",5
Whenever we leave the house for errands we would take these out of the freezer already filled up with peanut butter inside... I am not sure how long it last before they lick all of it off but it does keep them busy for a little bit and they love it!,5
pretty good substrate,5
My dog likes the flavor but they are too small and I have to be careful when I give to my dog she has choked on the small size.,3
it arrived green and it looks nice in the water,5
These worked great for getting the cat to take his medicine.,5
"<div id=""video-block-R1MYTNDUI2IOYN"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91J1sKRkdSS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1fCRCi%2B1TS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;It took him a little while to get adjusted but our two year old Yorkie mix eventually got the hang of it and likes it quite a bit! Looks like he might need more practice to put this in heavy rotation for feeding his meals but it's a great start.

Update: After two days of use this is zero challenge for him. He realized if he keeps his nose in to grab the food he just stays in one spot and makes the device spin so he can get the food faster. Takes half the time of his Kong Extreme chasing that around :( Changed to two stars.",2
"I was looking to replace an awesome reflective vest that I purchased a while back because apparently they don't make them anymore so this one came in the mail and it is pretty darn good.  I am worried that it will be difficult to clean because of the material and my dog loves to roll around on the grass/dirt.

I basically just got it for the reflective aspect but it is nice to have an extra mesh pocket on one side and poop bag holder on the other :)  I'm not sure if I'll have her carry her poop bag because if she rolls around I would imagine it could come out.  She has a backpack thing for that kind of stuff when we go for hikes.

I haven't use this vest on my dog but it does fit her well with more room to grow.  Very well made.  I do kind of wish it didn't have so much padding (almost like a quilt) because in So Cal weather it gets pretty hot.  Very durable looking vest and great price.",5
Tough useful and on my side when training walking and just out playing with my puppies!,5
Hair is coming easily out. I have it all over the house and I'm afraid my dog ate it too.,1
"Ordered a purple harness, it's definitely dark blue, not at all the color in the picture.",1
A+++ as advertized and very fast delivery,5
"Left these open for maybe ten minutes and the whole bag had dried out! Now my cat refuses to eat them. When they were wet, he loved them though. I know its my fault for leaving it open but jesus.. ten minutes? Really?",3
cat loves it,4
Great quality.,5
I ordered these in hopes that it would fit my dogs GPS attachement - unfortunately they are way to small. The product is nice and made for just smaller tags - only about 1 1/2 inches long and 1/2 wide.,4
"These are the BEST scratching posts I have ever found. They are sturdy and last seemingly forever plus all three of my cats love them. They like scratching in them. They like lying in them. They like playing in them. They like eating catnip out of them. Make sure that you get the original Original Scratch Lounge tho. I have seen some, same brand but not made out of as thick a cardboard as pictured here.",5
Does the job it was designed for,5
Very nice little winter jacket for tiny little 2lb Dogs good quality and very well made,5
"We have 4 cats, one of which is a 23 lb Maine Coon. This box is big enough for him and the rest of the crew. Once a year we replace the boxes because of the wear and tear they get all year and we always buy these pans. Love the high sides to keep the kitty litter contained. We don't use the tops because we have a cat that it terrified of closed spaces so I can't comment on that aspect. We are happy with this product and have 3 of them in the house at all times.",5
Bought for animal services.  Dogs enjoyed them.,4
This dog food contains meat as the first ingredient.  It does not have by products or chemicals.  All of my dogs liked it.,5
"The only complaint I have about this one is that it does not cover the litter
smell away, I am going to try the scented version and see it if is any better.",4
our cats love it,5
"I buy it because my two cats like FF and none other.  So finicky so I spend the extra money to give them a can a day of grilled Fancy Feast.  They eat only the grilled texture, none other.  Don't know why but I love 'em so they get what they like. :)  I believe buying FF through Amazon has saved me some money, not much, but it's on the monthly delivery.",5
Works as advertised.,5
"Good, basic poop bags, good price.",5
Best,5
My dogs love it!  When it arrived I went ahead and gave all three of my Mals some just to try it out and they couldn't get enough. When Bella my female Alaskan Malamute is pregnant she tends to not want to eat her dog food most of her pregnancy so I bought this and I will update on if she still likes it when she is pregnant.,5
It is a possible solution for shock absorbing normal collar walks. Have used it with nylon martingale collar and jerk Eeze performed as advertised. We are still using a nose training collar for our 10 month old puppy. When the training time is right and our puppy grows we plan to use this collar attachment as a long loose leash trail walking assist.,4
Made a huge difference for my 13 year old rat terrier,5
"My dog loves these, my daughters dog loves these in fact she's excited to visit because she knows the treats are good.",5
Great for very mature cats....,5
"These chews have reduced my Samoyed's plague considerably. She knows the 8pm is ""big treat"" time and starts hounding us about 7pm! She loves her chews!",5
"It's good if you get a litter pan that can go inside of it that has high walls or by some miracle your cat is very careful with how they conduct their business :) I got the ""Litter Pans and Rims large Pan, 18.6 in. x 14.7 in. x 9.8 in."" at first and she missed when trying to do a number one in a front corner... so I had to de-commission the nightstand until I could find a better solution. Based on the measurements the ""IRIS Open Top Litter Box with Shield and Scoop"" wouldn't fit inside this nightstand, but correct me if I am wrong.

I got crafty and cut out the little file hanging part of one of these (so stuff wouldn't get caught on the ledge): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006VPLRAK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1, then cut off the top of another one to flip up-side-down, and then cut a doorway (some from each piece). It fits great but don't do this unless you have the right tools and skills because you'll end up cutting yourself and it's not worth it. I cut only enough of the top one off so that when I put the make-shift litter pan into the nightstand, the nightstand holds it together (no wiggle room so I don't need latches on the side -- makes for a very tall litter pan).

The nightstand itself is kind of flimsy for the price and extra work required to get a viable litter pan (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). It would be good to seal it on the inside -- I put a garbage bag under my make-shift litter pan just in case and nothing has gotten on it in 4 months of use by a messy kitty. Make sure if other people are going to be moving it around that they know not to lift it by the top part because it pops right off with the weight of the litterbox inside. Physics are hard.",4
Nice,5
"Wood looks gorgeous, only tiny complaint is one of the bowls looks to have a few tiny spots of rust and black. have used steel wool and the discoloration is still there.",4
This works really well and the dog liked it too!,5
My dogs love.,5
Easy to set up and excellent gates!,5
Great addition to our guinea pigs chew toy collection.,5
my dog loves it,5
The treat of choice for my beabull pup...we got a bag as a gift when we adopted her last year and at first i admittedly was skeptical as i'd never heard of the brand...but a little research returned rave reviews and since they're made in the USA we were comfortable giving them to her...Kasey absolutely adores the extra tasty assortment and we'll definitely be sticking with these treats for her!,5
This is one the cats will eat.,4
"I have a 75 lb Giant Schnauzer, and she LOVES this thing! I use it as a reward for good behavior, and it's held up really well! she drags me all over the place with it! I plan on buying it again when it finally gives up.",5
Best Balls for my Dog yet!!,5
My 10 pound puppy loves this toy! Have had it for a week or 2 and it's still entact :),5
Our 6 adopted shelter cats love it and we know it is really healthy for them!!,5
"My cat has a lot of fun with these.  Nice to find a toy ""his pickiness"" will play with.  And they are so cheap I don't have to worry if they get lost under the sofa, I can just toss him another.",5
"This is the first time, I have had any kind of harness for my dogs.  My new puppy will be traveling with me to different places, to help with my anxiety.  We got the Kugo Harness, and I saw that they had the seatbelt tether.  So far, I am happy with both products.  I like that the seat belt tether I can leave clipped into the seat belt, and then I can just attach him with the carabiner, to his harness.  It is very easy to use, and it has made taking my dog places a much more enjoyable and safe.  Do to sick family members, who are not able to help me take my dog places, this is wonderful.  I really don't think dogs should have full access to the whole car as it is dangerous.  This gives me, peace of mind that I am keeping my dog as safe as I possibly can, and I always put him in the back seat, which is the safest place for a dog.  Unfortunately, this is the only harness and seatbelt I have ever used, so I can't compare it to others, all I can say is that I am pleased with it.  Also I did not purchase this on amazon, like I usually do, but got it at petsmart as the dog trainer there recommended it.  She is an awesome trainer, who tells me exactly what she thinks of products, and will tell me to stay clear of products that they sell, if she feels they are not safe, so I felt that her recommendation, would be a plus, since shopping on amazon for something you have no idea about, could be hard with all of the different harnesses.  I am happy and my dog is happy!",5
Great,5
I have an assortment of API products and they are all fantastic.  I use this in all of my aquariums to help balance my tank cycles and it also helps keep my tank clean between water changes.,5
Our cats really love this product. The seal on it is not working that well so we have to use it up within two weeks once open or the color will change.,5
"Best Bird food, been feeding my bird this for 18 years now, no health issues at all.  Thanks Harrisons for making a fine product",5
"Love the pedestal, it isn't tipsy and looks pretty in the yard. Only wish the birds would check it out. Haven't seen a bird in it yet.",5
"works great. You don't have to worry about other critters getting in. I have one that I bought 7 years ago, and it still works. You do have to replace the batteries once a year, however.",5
My dogs asks for these every day.  He likes to brush his teeth.:),5
MOST EXCELLENT,5
Good product my dog seems to enjoy them.,4
My dogs love this.,5
"My senior cat (16 going on 17) was starting to have malabsorbition issues and was losing body mass. I did some research and found information from a veterinarian and a workup on a study done on a cat colony that was allowed to self regulate the amount of protein vs fat vs carbs in their diet...anyway, most cat foods do not meet the protein requirements for cats and certainly not for senior cats (don't buy into that whole senior cat food nonsense about reduced protein and high fiber) I selected this dry food for its high protein content. A half cup of this food a day provides enough protein for a maintenance level for my cat. I feed him that much of this food daily and he gets a few servings of wet food as well. He has started to gain some mass back and he loves this food. Switching to higher protein should be done gradually with senior cats though as it can shock their kidneys. He is doing well on this food and hopefully he will stick around for a few more years because of it!",5
Great toy! My pit bull loves it and hasn't destroyed it yet. We've had it almost a year and all the squeaker still work. She likes this and Skineez toys but she usually wears the squeaker out on the Skineez eventually but not this one.,5
"Of course the majority do favor these pill pockets. The last dog I had would eat them sometimes with her pill, but sometimes not.  I was disappointed that such an expensive product wasn't that tasty to my dog.  I doubt that I will ever buy this product again, especially since it is quite expensive when you realize you don't get much for your money. Notice the even the Amazon add doesn't state how many pockets are in the bag.  You have to mouse over to see that there are only about 30 in the bag. Why is that a big deal?  Well assuming this isn't human grade ingredients as with dog food (correct me if my assumptions is wrong), you can use human grade ingredients  I believe for a lot less.

There are recipes on line you can try to make your own pill pockets, but i found a quicker way.  I simply buy a block of cheese (Velveeta or Walmart brand to save even more money). My dog is picky and only mildly interested in cheese and won't eat peanut butter.  I cut a piece of cheese big enough cover the pill  well, then I stick bits of leftover chicken, turkey, or other meat into the cheese.  You may have to do a little squishingof the cheese and bits of meat to make the bits stick securely.  If leftover meats are not available, use bits of cold cuts.  I think it's a good bet your dog will like it better than pill pockets and you are using known quality ingredients. Don't use fat, especially dogs susceptible to pancreatitis, such as schnauzers.

If your dog likes peanut butter, you can try wrapping the pill with a little piece slice bread.  Use only the white part of the bread, as the crust will not stick to the pill. Put a drop or two of water on the bread to make it doughy enough to stick to the pill, then add a blob of peanut butter around it.  Wrap the left over bread in plastic wrap and place in fridge for the next dose.  You can make a lot of simple pill pockets with that block of cheese.  In my opinion, Pill Pockets is over priced.

I know there are those who may say, hey we don't need all this extra info, we are here to rate a product.  I'm just trying help others to try an inexpensive alternative (and more tasty).",2
Wow! This mat is large enough for my oversized cat litter pan (I use a shallow storage bin) and for my two cats to hop out and have their paws gently cleaned on their way out. It has cut down on the trail of kitty litter debris around the house.,5
Wonderful for hot spots and dandruff. The conditioner leaves my dogs coats smelling fresh and soft. The shampoo really works great even after the first use. Both my dogs stopped itching immediately after first bath,5
"This is a small automatic water dish.  So, don't expect to use it for anything bigger than a 5lb dog.  Im using it for my cats and its perfect.  So, no start removed for the size.
I have a larger one, and I like it a lot better.  First, there is a screw on lid for the larger one, which has a hole in it.  It makes putting it onto the actual drinking part of the bowl much easier.  I never spill a drop with my larger one.  This small one has nothing.  Its just wide open.  So, you have to hold it upside down, put the bowl part on, then flip it over.  I have yet to not make a huge mess.  Its kind of a hassle to get it on to the bowl correctly as well.  Just when I have it fit right and get ready to flip it, one side pops off.
My next complaint is the price.  I think it is highly over priced.  I paid less for my 2 gallon waterer.  I think if this sold for somewhere between $5-$7, it would totally be worth it.  But, anything more than that and it is over priced.
My overall opinion is it is ok Not something I would recommend, but not something Id tell somebody not to buy.
Disclaimer: I received this product at a free or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",3
"I ordered this flavor for my dog and he doesn't like , I had to mix this food and adding chicken the other way he wouldn't eat it. A little disappointed with this product.",3
Dog loves it!,5
Love this shampoo. Great cleanser. Product is gel like consistency. CAn be diluted and remain effective. Smells great.,5
"It's not cheap, but as an alternative to other meds, I like it. The dog seems to have more energy and is more himself. I don't know how it works, but something in it helps him and I will continue until he doesn't need it anymore.",4
"My 2 small dogs love these. We started with the little 5 oz bag of mini training rewards and they went over so well that now we've graduated to these. These are larger, double the size of the minis and also double calories...but at like 3 calories it's fine.
In the very cold winter in the Rocky Mountains, sometimes going out is downright dangerous for more than literally a few minutes for my little guys (under 10 lbs). Puppy pads to the rescue!!! With little bacon treat reinforcement they're hitting the target every time!",5
"I love this ornament. It is a good size (about 4"" across). It sways and moves in the water like a real plant. I have ordered 2 more since receiving it.",5
its ok,3
seem to work.,5
Great for bunny,5
"Awesome deal!! These are just small bowls, but perfect for travel. I do a boot camp program on Saturday's that's for me and my dog (hard core work out with obedience training weaved in, love it) and these bowls are perfect bc the collapse and take up no room! My large dog gets 1 cup of Orijen kibble per meal, which fills this bowl, so it's about 8-10 ozs",5
"I love the light from these, and have used them over the Power-Glo because the light is so much better from this brand. However as others have noted in these reviews - the country of manufacture has changed, and the quality has gone down hill in a major way.

Both bulbs flickered, but then started working. Even though they both had 'loose' pieces inside, and felt very cheap.. Within 2 weeks one of them failed to properly illuminate, and flickered. Basically, it lasted two weeks, when on average - these used to last 2 YEARS. So something changed, these are pretty terrible now. This saddens me, another good product gone down the tubes.. (no pun intended)

EDIT: SOLUTION FOUND!!!  To find the 'right' color, you want to search for COLORMAX bulbs.. Apparently this company outsources their normal bulbs to some cheap company overseas. But has retained the 'colormax' version to be made in Germany, with the true Full Spectrum 'purpleish' glow we all love..  This will solve all of the issues with people unhappy with Aqueons new junk manufacturer.",1
This is now in our 5th wheel trailer and I keep dry food in the bottom and treats and can food in the top. Perfect for our needs. I liked that it came with a scoop for the dry food too.,5
fit  very small on my dog,2
"A beautiful, well-made leash.",5
excellent container i love it and keeps the food fresh,5
looks really cool on my Mal and is very durable,5
I own two border collies.  One is 3 and one is a puppy.  they both love this toy.  It goes a fair distance when kicked and can be easily thrown as well.  My older dog loves to chew on all of his fetch toys.  He has been known to pop a basketball pretty quickly.  He has tried his hardest to pop this thing but has been unsucessful.  He loves this ball and so do I!,5
Plastic was fragile and broke after six weeks in two different places.,2
"My cats kept flipping of their old water bowl. I had to find something that they can't flip over. I don't know how much water that they were drinking, eventhough I would give them about 64oz. per day, most of it was all over the floor. Now it seem to be harder for them to flip over. I have seen them try, by standing on the side of the bowl and still can't. All of my cats are drinking about a gallon of water per day (12 cats). I like it soooo much I just bought another one.",4
"I was looking forward to these as you don't see many cookie type dog treats and my puppy has a sweet tooth.  They got good reviews too.  He does like the taste of these - he takes the cookie and devours it.  The problem is that the cookies are huge.  I have a small dog, so this might not be as much of an issue with a 40+ lb dog, they have bigger mouths but even my parents 45lb dog would not be able to eat these easily.  He'd have to break it into multiple pieces and eat those.  When they break it up, it makes a huge mess.  TONS of crumbs and they are sticky.  My puppy ate all the big pieces but had no interest in the crumbs so I am left to clean them up.  Not fun, so now he's not allowed to eat them unless he's outside.  Which has limited use. Also i was annoyed at the shape of these cookies, kind of like thick circles or biscuits.  ITs impossible to break up the cookie into a smaller piece to give to him.  It would be much smarter if these were flatter and longer shaped (or smaller!!) so that you could break it up into smaller pieces.  I won't be buying these again and i won't recommend them to anyone else unless you have a huge dog and don't mind crumbs.",2
Bought this to replace smaller dog door and installed it in exterior wall that leads to covered patio (it does not have any sun or rain touch it - much cheaper method). Build frame inside wall (2x4's) and used wood screws rather than ones that came with it to attach frame to wall/2x4's. It's perfect! Will be ordering more for inside house as well.,5
Great cat grass! It is still growing after a month and a half!! Just add water to it every few days.,5
I received this dog harness today. I really like it and so does my puppy Meadow. I read the reviews and ordered according to the comments. Meadow is a 13 pound Maltipoo. It fit her perfectly. She usually wears a size medium but the large fits perfectly. It is almost too small but they usually stretch over time.,5
The step to get on the ramp is a little too high for a smaller dog and I can't imagine a larger dog using this.  My girl is about w0 pounds and did not want to use this at all.  We have a ramp that we purchased that has a nice landing and goes all the way to the ground that she has no issues with.  I would not recommend.,2
Dr recommended but easier to get at Amazon.,5
"I'm hooked on these guys! I'm a Betta fish freak and these are so low maintenance that I think I want them for my lawn!!! They supply oxygen and are so pretty, and and dirty like other plants. Be a doll and send me a million of these. Please!",5
"This is too severe.  I bought it to replace a similar collar (the blue one) which i couldn't find on amazon when I needed to replace it.  The links are too big making sizing difficult.  We are using it with great caution but I would not buy again, nor would I recommend.",2
just as described.  delivered promptly.  great price.  what else could one need...,5
These pork hide bones seem high quality and my dogs like them but they are 75 lb and 87 lb dogs so they don't last more than 15 min per bone. I am not sure that the 20 bones are gonna last in my house long at all. Wish they sold these same bones but much larger sized for large breed dogs. These bones would be perfect for 20 to 40 lb dogs,4
"I purchased this item as a result of the great reviews.  However, the jar was all dried up and unusable.  A waste of money on my part!",1
Great product for your cat/(s). Very easy to setup in minutes. But I wish they would have come up with a lot better suction cup for the top. A lever type suction cup for the top would have been better.,5
Helps our Zena!,5
Great little light for the price.,5
cat loves it,5
My dogs don't like these treats.  Go figure.  My neighbor's dog liked them a lot.,3
"This is adorable, but my keets shredded it very quickly.  A bit high cost for shredding. :)",4
Very cute collar and well made. Good length and lots of room for adjusting. I couldn't hear the bell when she moves or walks through the house like her old collar I got from my local pet store but I'm satisfied with my purrrrchased  =^o^=,5
"These pads are wonderful as a gentle way to 'spot clean' your pet when the need arises, but a full bath is not necessary or possible.  Nice, gentle scent and the pop-up container is great!",5
"I have one cat with a sensitive stomach and another one who doesn't need this per say. But I give them both the same food and they don't seem to complain, but I really wouldn't know they were complaining unless they stop eating it. That hasn't happened. I have this setup on the Amazon subscribe and Save deal, so I get a bag every two months.",5
Kind of expensive for the purpose of piss.,4
My only complaint is that it works better in a box tank than a bowl tank because it will always angle down if you put it towards the top of a bowl shaped tank. The connector should have been a spherical nub that could be tilted/rotated. My beta appears to be liking it more every day though!,4
"I purchased the medium bed in brown. I was looking for an elevated bed so she would stop trying to steal our office chairs. She likes to sit up close to us while we work.

General Info:
I have one 25 pound dog and I could fit two of her on each level. However the bed is thin but long - I can fit two of her because her long-way fits the bed's short-way. If your dog were any bigger it would have to lay the long way and you could only fit one per level.  I would recommend considering the large bed if your dog is 40 pounds or larger.

The Good:
-Surprisingly sturdy
-Does exactly what I needed

The Bad:
-The bed does not include the leopard print bolster you see in the pictures. That is sold separately for approximately $45.

-The synthetic canvas material used on the sides is also used to cover the mattresses. This material is not soft, comfortable, or in any way cozy. The first thing I did was put a blanket down for her. The aforementioned $45 bolster only covers the edges, leaving the uncomfortable mattress exposed.

-See that instruction manual in your hands? The one that came with the bed? Yeah, that one. OK throw it out. It shows a drawing of the completed bed, and each part of the completed bed is lettered. Then it says take Part B and attach it to Part E. OK. Hrm. See I can't tell which part is Part E and which one is Part B because the parts themselves aren't labeled and the picture only shows the whole thing assembled. Once you have the bed totally assembled you will then know which part is A and which is E. Won't that be edifying. So just toss it and you'll figure it out yourself. The screws strip really easily so make sure you have all the pieces threaded through the canvas before you screw it together.

-You will need a bit of strength to stretch the canvas over everything. I used pliers for a better grip.

-You will think you can assemble the bed in about 3 minutes but it took me an hour because of the useless instructions, having to unscrew everything that should have been threaded through the canvas first, and trying to pull the plastic canvas into submission.

-There are several clips, loops, and Velcro patches that go with optional accessories. I don't think they look nice on the bed because I like everything to be clean and have a purpose.

-It looks a little like a kiddie play-pen but I am secure with myself so I don't mind. At least I don't have a doggie stroller.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pet-Gear-Special-Edition-Pet-Stroller-for-cats-and-dogs-up-to-45-pounds-Sage/dp/B00134HSYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pet Gear Special Edition Pet Stroller for cats and dogs up to 45-pounds, Sage</a>

-Double check the length measurement before you buy. It is probably longer than you think it is.

The Verdict:
I know those seem like a lot of cons for a 4 star review, but I am happy with the bed. I mostly wish the mattress had been made of a more comfortable material. Thanks and I hope you enjoy your bed!",4
Been using two of these on a 150 gallon tank and they clean well. Very easy to change the filters. They are now four years old and one of the motors burned up. Got very very hot. I believe it was due to the water level dropping below the minimum line. I could not find anyone who sold just a new pump so had to buy a whole new unit. I also use a smaller model Tetra on my smaller tank. That one also cleans well but I like the ease of changing the filters on this model better.,5
Thanks,5
Good.,5
"These are awesome! I use it for my cat food since I only give them a partial can per day. (Much better than sealing the leftovers in a plastic baggie). These are very convenient. I plan on purchases more for my family members. Sometimes simple little things like this can be so helpful in life. They are even able to be used on cans of soups etc (human food).
I also love that they come in different colors. That way it is very clear to me that ""Green is for kitties"" and the rest is for human food :)",5
"My dog loves this bag! I wish the strap was shorter, as my doggie hangs a  little low. You can snuggle them in the bag. I would buy again.",5
Works fine.,4
Literally.,3
"Great stuff. We got it for our red tail boa. It works great and this is a decent size bag, so it will last a while.",5
my dog sheds terribly so this tool really helps keep my hands free of all that hair at bathtime,5
"Excellent price, same as aquarium stress coat. I think it's cheaper because it's marketed for ponds, not aquarium. It's a higher concentration too! I use far less stress coat and spend less. Win win.",5
Beautiful. Functional and good looking for the room as well. Has a good small door width.,5
dog likes it,5
Have had this for three years now and it still seals perfectly.  Excellent lid ergonomics makes it easy to use one handed.  Our dog food stays fresh and we can easily see how much is left thanks to the translucent/clear plastic sides.  AND- it's made in the USA with 20% recycled plastic.  It's a no brainer- this is the best large pet food container on Amazon.,5
Not quite that good on my Lab The harness is not the most intuitive to use and strap in your over excited dog. She gets so excited I had to stop my car and redo the harness and tighten it up,3
"I have two, small Westies and since they are constantly getting dirty, I wash them 2-3 times per month.  After a day of being washed, I use 1/2 the for each of the dogs (which is about 1 full dose a month) and this does the trick.",5
"Both of our Havanese have these life vests. We like these vests for their sturdy construction, especially the handle on top, and for the fact that they are made of foam cell (vs neoprene). It is easy to put on and our dogs don't seem to mind them, even if they are a bit clumsy and not as flexible as neoprene would be.",5
This product has practically eliminated the vomiting and mushy stools one of my cats was experiencing and the vomiting from hairballs one of my other cats was dealing with. Digestive issues are now not a problem for them or for me when I clean these messes up. Everyone seems happy. I alternate this product every other day with Dr. Goodpet Feline Digestive Enzymes and they work together like a charm. Price is right as well and all 4 of my cats approve of the taste. Highly recommend.,5
Ornithological loved ones too,5
great product,5
"1)  This Perch is so rough it will tear up your Bird's Feet!
And will give you a Vet Bill to pay!

2)  I ordered the SMALL and got a size that would fit a Condor!!!
Because it is sent out by Amazon... I was not offered the option of Seller Feedback!

Now I get to waste my precious time trying to get my money back... make arrangements to get
this Wrong Item sent back... and UPS in our area refuses to do Pickups... I am debilitated to drop-offs
are not an option for me...

"My cat liked the round toy the best. I kept having to fish it out from under the sofa. I haven't tried out the wand toy yet, but I'm sure it will be a hit. My cat loves wand toys. These toys are well made and very durable.",4

"This is a cute little bowtie, too bad I didn't read the description fully. My dog is too big but i made due for a photoshoot and he looked like a proper gentleman. Then it fell off...",5
Great product to keep for animals,5
"My pup loves this toy. She is a power chewer, and for some reason she hasn't destroyed this. She broke the squeaker after a few weeks, but she continues to love this. The long pieces flap around when she shakes her head, and she has a ball with it and really plays and entertains herself with this.  A great buy!",5
My 5 pound Chi loves this toy. She is always playing with it,5
Using this waterer for my hens outside of their coop and I am very pleased with its operation and ease in cleaning and usage.,5

"These are decent rawhide bones but they do not seem to last much longer than any others I have bought for my dogs. They do sliver, but not as badly as other bones that I have gotten. Do not seem to do damage to the dogs' systems.",3
This collar works without severe correction!  The audible beep at the first bark makes my dog zip it!,5
"Fantastic. You have to wait a long time for them to arrive, but they are the same balls you get in smaller packs, but at a way better price.  My cats hide these things,and I have no idea where their stash is.  (Probably under the bed.) It is great to have a plethora.",5
"This gizmo seems to work as advertised.  I used it on my beagle mix who used to constantly, without fail, ""lecture"" me any time he was left alone for even a short time.  To begin with I would set up/turn on the bark off when leaving the house so that upon my return, if/when he went into lecture mode, it would be on.  It sure seemed to work!  On a hunch, I showed him the bark off each time I returned and he tried to go into a barking frenzy.  I also made a point of letting him see me place it and turn it on when I was leaving.  The seems to have helped ""condition' him to associate unpleasantness with the device itself which has turned out to be a very good thing.
Since I was concerned that the bark off might be emitting ultra-high sound even when it was off (there is no pilot light to TRULY indicate it is on/off) I removed the battery and tried the same routines with the (now) silent bark off.  SUCCESS!  If he does seem to be entering lecture mode, I show him the silenced device and he thinks twice about barking.
Personally I would not recommend this device for noisy households for obvious reasons and I would also be cautious about leaving it on for extended periods of time such as days, weeks or months.",5
I have not had a chance to use yet. These were recommended by my groomer for touch ups in between her appointments.,4
I wanted to love this toy. It took my power chewers like 2 minutes to rip these things apart. I wasn't expecting miracles but I was hoping for better. Would only recommend this for dogs that aren't chewers at all!,3
"Great fresh scent......we are still waiting to see how it does for the fleas and ticks, but it smells great!",4
"Wonderful!  We live in Texas, and winters may get down to freezing for a couple of months, but are usually in the 40s and 50s.  Consequently, I wasn't looking for a heavy-duty coat for our rat terrier who freezes outside, but won't let us pull a sweater over her head.  This jacket is perfect - easy to get on and lightweight enough for her to play in.  The  dogs don't  stay out in the rain enough to get soaked, but it's perfect for her to run out to  do her business - the raindrops just shake off the velvet coat, and she'll actually go out into the yard when it's raining now!

I totally  misjudged the size, though - ordered a medium, because she's a little pudgeball.  The length down her back is good, but it's a little loose around her chest and ribs, so don't worry about your dog's weight when buying this - there's plenty of room around the middle to accommodate.  Still, I thought erring larger was better - wrong!  Since it's a little big on her, and she has short little legs, the chest fastening across the front hangs down past the start of her legs, annoying her a bit when  running.  We also tried it on our mini poodle, and it fit perfectly, although she's thin; she's black and has longer legs - cutest little red riding hood ever!",5
I have had this product for 2 months and I have 2 males and 2 females. Neither of them use it or have shown any interest in using it.,1
my dog loves it.,5
"This is especially nice because it is longer than typical ""small"" dog coats and the sleeves are nice to have as opposed to large holes where the arms come out. My dog doesn't shiver when he is in this sweater.",5
"Yes, he loves almost every cookie make by the dog factories!  But, a Dingo arrives in the mail; and he can't control himself.  He licks, jumps, grabs at the box and does double doggie circles knowing mom will give in.  So now, he's quietly resting on the bed, his feet placed firmly on the treat (like I want it), and will stay there until almost nothing is left.  Couldn't spoil the kids as they had to be kind, respectful adults; Sonora is actually envied by his extended family.  Thanks so much for keeping peace in the house!!",5
"My dog had an itching problem so I switched to Merrick about a year ago. Now, she very rarely scratches herself. I love that her food it delivered to my door and I don't have to schlep it from the store. We like the 12-lb. size because it fits in our storage container and can be easily maneouvered. Both of my dogs love both the Buffalo and the Chicken, so we alternate each month. They are healthy and have bright eyes and a shiney coat. There has NEVER been a recall on Merrick as far as I know, unlike the other 'premium' dog food I was using!",5
"My cats eat the sauce, but they seem not to be crazy over the salmon. Sorry.",3

"This is THE favorite toy for a 75 lb. Blonde Lab - loves this thing and
you can stuff it with other items like snacks if you want to mix it up.
Also has a crunchy sound from the liner material which makes it interesting on its own.  I would definitely buy the largest size toy
if your dog is bigger than a ""purse dog"".",5
"Wasn't sure about these but I bought three for my dogs in different colors and they did an excellent job.  The colors, shapes and engraving was done right and they arrived fast and I ended up buying another one for a friends dog I dog sit.  Well worth the price to know if your dog does get lost these tags can get him or her home again.",5
"After one reviewer suggested using clear gem glass (like what you use for decoration, fish tanks or candles. I thought I would try. So I emptied out the pellets and added 5 pounds of glass gems.  It worked great, but I had one cat scared of the transparent color. So then I ordered green gems and it works perfectly.  The green gems with the green liter box is actually pretty. And no more tracking - NONE.  Even if it did track, it wouldn't hurt your feet with the gems.  So I love this box with the new creative idea of using gems.  Just order the pads in bulk. No heavy lifting, no dust at all.  There is a little odor just for the first few minutes if a cat poops. But it dries quickly and no odor.  The gems are here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHXU5BY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",5
"My tabby Poombah who is a solid 16 lbs and LOVES to eat, really likes this food. He has toned up a bit eating this food. The vet says he is perfectly healthy, just large boned in size. A bag lasts about 2 months.",5
Leaves coat shinny and soft,5
This worked well for my dog. She eventually learned to step into it and it was very secure. I only wish that the D-rings were sewn in a little more so that they would stand up a bit. Other than that small caveat this is a great product.,4
Love this lead! Having the two hand grip loops allows me more control and is just the right size for me. It matched the vest I also bought from this company. Both items came quickly and are working out well. The only thing I didn't really like was that the clip is a claw style and was very difficult to attach to the vest the first few times (I had trouble getting the clasp open wide enough to get it on the vest ring). It was very stiff and had to be worked until it loosened enough to use.,4
"Cute, but had to return as it was small. I ordered a size small for my Shih Tzu. I recommend going a size or two higher.",5
Puppy loves it,4
"well made, make sure you measure and get the right size",5
"I did a lot of enquiring about dog food when I adopted my new best friend.  Quality vs. price and chose Taste of the Wild.  My dog was originally on standard cheap dog food, which was given to her at the shelter.  Slowly introduced Taste of the Wild.  My dog's behavior really improved within several days becoming more calm and focused.  Coat is more shiny and thick with less shedding.
Worth every penny.",5
Puppia harness fits perfectly and comfortably to my 90-pound Rottweiler (XXL Puppia harness). I took the time to measure my dog's neck before ordering and I suggest you do the same for the best possible fit. I choose the black color but other colors may please your taste better.,5
"This is perfect to hold the remains of my pet bird. I wish that they made a smaller urn for even smaller pets, but I love the intricate details of the product.",5
I have seen massive improvement in my dog since switching to this food. He has a mild food allergy and that is why we chose this formula. He loves it and we have been happy with it!,5
dogs love it.,5
"This is a nice fit for my ever so slightly overweight lab.  He doesn't mind having it on, so I'm guessing it must be comfortable for him.  Seems to be good quality at a decent price.",4
"My Yorkie is a playful Yorkie so she'll really play with any toy I buy for her BUT she goes crazy with this one!  Since my Yorkie is just around 8"" in length (yes, she's tiny and a real cutie!) I had to show her how to make the toy squeak.  It took her a few minutes to actually have one of the squeakers make a sound but after she learned how to do it, there's no stopping her!

I keep this from her since she really tires herself out (and I'm scared that she might get too tired!) playing with it.  It's sooo cute how she enjoys playing with it, squeaking it and turning it over!  When she stops to rest, she'll make sure this toy is beside her and when I try to take it out, she'll immediately wake up and play with it again.

I keep this toy inside a drawer but I guess the material makes her own scent stick to it.  She would sniff and bug me to get it for her.

But beware!  Expect this toy to be wet with saliva after each play.  That's what happens to the one I have.

Totally loooove this toy for my Yorkie.  It makes her so happy playing with it :)",5
It is what it is. wheels haven't broken during use in kitchen. Ive used it for dog food or rice,4
It is very warm and my dog love it.,5
"It's work well with my Pit mix, I feel more relax when I took him to walk than other",5
"The sound box inside this toy lasted less than 5 minutes before breaking. It was not a sturdy as some of the other Multipet toys I have bought in the past. I was really disappointed in the sound box quality. The toy is cute, the sound was fun while it lasted.",2
"This harness has been awesome for my fur baby. My girl is a Pitbull/Boxer who weighs about 63 pounds so I got her the XXL and it fits her pretty good. She was right on the cusp between an XL and XXL. The XXL is good though because it's not too tight, I just put it on the furthest it can go on tightness. It's great fabric, and I can just throw it in the wash when it gets dirty. Good buy!",5
Didn't work at all. My 14 month old Newf mix doesn't like the taste. No difference in anxiety levels.,1
"Bag is somewhat small, no tie handles.  Would not buy this again.",2
they love these,5
Comfort Zone with DAP for dogs diffuser refill is wonderful. This product calms my dogs and helps them have better behavior. I foster dogs and when I bring new dogs in this is a must have product.,5
"The package just arrived this morning.  My dog usually doesn't like just dry kibble and won't eat it unless I put chicken or something in it to tempt him.  But I opened the bag, put a handful of the kibble in his bowl and he gobbled it down.  That is a good sign that we may have a new food for him that he likes.  I am very pleased so far.  Now if it will stop his incessant scratching, I will really be happy.",5
"I have had my chinchilla for years now and I give him a mix of this and Charlie Chinchilla food. There are people that say there are too many treats in this, and for some chinchillas that may be true. For my chinchilla who has eaten this all his life, there are no problems. Yes when he was younger he liked to pick out the treats rather than eat all the hay pellets, but all I did to combat that was buy hay blocks and stop topping off his bowl until he ate the hay pellets. Some chinchillas just don't like the pellets in certain food. Mine prefers those in the Charlie food which also has dried vegetables and that is why I mix them. My chinchilla gets plenty of treats and he has always been a healthy boy. You just have to ensure you are adding more hay to their diet in the form of fresh hay, which should be offered aside from these food mixes in any event. This is not a bad food for Chinchillas.",5
"This is the perfect size for my Australian shepherd/golden retriever mix pup. The treats I bought with it fit perfectly and do not slide out, I only wish they were healthier and had no wheat or grain in them.. But I don't consistently use those treats for her, only when I'm in a rush out the door. However, when this arrived it did arrive in all pink... I wasn't too upset about it because I have a female puppy, but do beware, you may get a different color then what you ordered.
My pup loves the Kong because she only gets it when she goes in her crate (a great way to crate train your puppy and help with timidness of the crate) and it's now her favorite toy. Crate time is Kong time for her, and it definitely helped me with potty training her, keeping her from boredom, and crate training. Who knew a toy could do all that?!",5
"The orbee-Tuff toys are the best.  Nearly indestructible, and the dogs seems to really love the tough yet chewy material.  Unfortunately, this particular ball didn't ""glow"" but the dog doesn't seem to mind at all.",4
our 2 boston terriers love this bed. well worth the money spent to see them cuddled together in there.,5
This  toy has survived my pit for over 6 months now. That's unheard of. She is a heavy chewer and destroyer of toys!,5
"This is a very nice cover ... For pets AND if you have a car seat on top of it. The problem for anything else is that the favpbric is uncomfortable. It does fit nicely across the back bench seat of my car, but even for my dogs, I really prefer to put a blanket under them for comfort. Mostly because the waterproof nature makes it very hot to lay on. Unless you specifically need waterproof, I would look for a fabric option.",3
"Seems like quality material. The only reason Im giving it 4 stars is that I wish it was a little brighter.
It's a nice feature though that you can switch in to a blinking mode.",4
"This toy is well-made and all, but my cat figured it out in literally about 10 seconds.  Even on the smallest setting, she just slowly noses it around in a circle and eats as she goes for about two minutes -- not really exercise at all. I guess it does slow her down a liiittle bit, but I was expecting something a little more challenging for her.",3
Works just as it describes on the label and my cat doesn't revisit the spots where I've used it. Great buy at a decent price!,5
These fit the Kong incline cat scratcher I bought on Amazon last year. I had a difficult time finding these but kept searching every once in a while and finally here they are! I stocked up and should be good for the rest of the year since both sides can be used. My cats love these. They do not have to be cut to size if you have the same incline scratcher I do. They come with a bag of catnip taped to them just like the original scratchers that come with the incline box originally.,5
"Not all it's hyped up to be. The clay when wet smears and gets hard to get off the scooper.
-It does well for covering up odor
-It does track
-There isn't any dust
-It clumps okay.",4
Very comfortable and very light and well made. Perfect!,5
"The best! Looks great  on  all dogs had to get the size right, but it was worth it thanks me",5
Love this product. It has helped our cats calm down considerable..,5
"Been using this harness on my cat for a few years now.  I really like it as it doesn't put pressure on the cat's delicate throat area, the pressure goes on the strap that goes around the chest instead.  The clips are small, but neither my husband nor I seem to have any problems opening them, yet they have never popped open on their own.  There is a small ring to hang rabies and ID tags.  I've had countless harnesses over the years, but this one has to rate as my favourite.  The cat has never once been able to slip out of it, and this was brought home the other night when she and the dogs absolutely  panicked after some people up the road unexpectantly set off fireworks.  Which made me think that it's worth it's weight in gold.",5
GENIUS,5
The elevated feeder is okay.  I could not use it because the bowls were too big and I could not put smaller bowls inside the large bowls and make it work for my dog.  The base is flimsy.  It is not a sturdy base so if you have a large clumsy dog the base may not work for you.  Otherwise it is okay.,2
Works great . Our dog has gained a bad habit when waking in am and when going outside. We use it only during these temp situations and so far so good. Has not effected other appropriate barking situations.,5
"This is a very good harness for choke free protection. This is so cute and made really good. Jasper doesn't mind having it on. It doesn't bind him in any way.

I received this for an honest and unbiased review.",5
Beautiful tag and the engraving is large and legible. Love it!!!! Plus the little pink paw is so pretty. Well worth the money spent.,5
Just got it in the mail yesterday and ordering another one right after I post this!  It was exactly what he needed!,5
I bought this as a gift to a rescue center for felines.  It was on their request list so sent it to them.  They use this product a lot and I also use it for my cats.,5
Good for everyday walks.  They fit nice and wash up great.  The material breathes in hot weather.  Easy to put on your pet.,5
Good product.  Have had excellent results.,5
My cats eat these - suppose it's the eggs. Good price.  But get a few varieties.  Every day use bores them and I'm left with a half full bowl.,5
"So far good results, no fleas",4
"Small dog, big chest.. Harness does not fit correctly.",3
"So far, so good!  I bought this comb specifically for one long haired cat that has a continuing problem with developing really knotty mats on his chest.  He was always okay with me working them out high on the chest, but just thought it was too much that I would persist in trying to pull out mats any lower on his chest.  This comb does allow me to get those mats out without hurting him and without getting into a hassle with him every few days.  I haven't tried using it on the dogs or other cats, mainly because they don't get those hard-to-remove mats that make this kind of tool necessary.  But I think that it would work well on just about any mat on any animal.",5
"Worked better than expected!  Bella (black lab) had 2 bad hotspots with all the fur missing and very inflamed... I applied the cream 2 times a day, (lightly cleaning before applying), and within 2 days she started getting better! After a few days she stopped itching all together and her hair started growing back!!  This stuff REALLY works!!!!",5
Great product easy to put on really easy cats love them,5
Does exactly as I expected.,5
not sturdy or big enough.,2
Bought this to feed a stray that was dropped off. Seems to be a bit better than the cheap stuff at the big box store.,5
This stuff is great. Smells so much better than the clay stuff and lasts longer because it's got a good pine scent. The pine scent covers up the waste smell much more effectively than the clay.,5
"...unfortunately I bought it for my little Malteze dog. I love the look,the sturdiness,the carpet. It's very well made. I love everything about it but my dog will not use it,he is afraid. I'm trying to coax/teach him ,but he won't move on them. Maybe taller sides would help. So I'm back  here again at Amazon.com,looking for another set of stairs. IMO,They are kind of steep and very narrow for a dog but perfect for a cat..",3
"I'm sure this stuff works to clean out the ears, but my dog is afraid of the applicator. I will put it in another bottle next time. It just goes all over the place, too.",3
I have a shepherd /lab mix and this bowl keeps her from horking it down as Remy said to Amil in Ratatouille. She still empties it  pretty fast but with that big tounge not much gets past .I would recommend it. If notrhing else its pretty amusing watching her twist around trying to empty  it so fast.,5
"I ordered two Aviator Bird Flight Line but they sent me one. I also bought two Aviator Harnesses, but since one was too small to fit onto my bird's head and the belt comes loose around the body, I tried to exchange for the next size, but I've been getting a round around. I wasn't even refunding my money..I just wanted to exchange it. The website states that a small would fit Goffin Cackatoos, but it barely fit onto my bird's head. I have to force my bird's head into the loop.",1
My dogs love the treats  !!!!!,4
"I like this shampoo for between baths or perfect when is cold and I don't want my dog to get sick, the smell is very nice and last longer than I thought, I was thinking to use it even after the regular baths just to keep him smelling nice. We have a maltese and he gets dirty very quickly since his color is white, then I can use it when He gets dirty from eating or just going to the bathroom outside or in a rainy day, sometimes he gets dirt on his paws and this is a better option than taking him in the bath tub to wash just his paws. I am glad I have the opportunity to sample the product and be able to give my opinion on it, like I said, I will just use it between baths and I won't never replace his regular baths with this product but I will use it as a complement to his cleaning routine.",4
"Would not contain a mid-size puppy - not recommended at all. He easily bent the frame. It's now held together with zip ties, but they will not last long.

If your dog/puppy has any will to get out, they will.",1
too stif don't fly as well as a old one i got long time ago it is thiner and bends easer.,1
really helps,5
Making a difference in my senior dogs life.,5
"We have two freakishly tall cats, one  of whom has recently started to use the back of my husband's new mesh office chair as a scratching post :(  We've always bought the $35 sisal rope and carpet posts from Petco, so when we saw this one was the same price, but about 3x taller, we decided to give it a try. The whole thing takes about 5min to set up, that includes taking it out of the boxes.  It's very sturdy and I like the fact that the sisal is WOVEN and not the cheap rope stuff that they glue around the Petco/Petsmart scratching posts (our cats always manage to eventually tear the rope off of the post.)

The cats initially just looked at it and walked by, but I brought both of them over and rubbed their pads against the sisal.  Within two minutes they were both scratching away and seemed to be pleased that they could stretch all the way up.  I didn't even have to use any catnip to lure them over, like the instructions suggest.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and hope that this one lasts longer than our previous ones.",5
The dogs can be picky. They have turned up their at Green,5
Our tiny toy poodle at 8 weeks took to this immediately.  Weewee pads were a complete failure so we are jumping for joy!  Not the best quality tray and grass although does the trick and the price you can't beat!,5
"I love that this food doesn't have byproducts, like most other brands do. The ingredients are healthy for my babies. I switched to this product from Marshall brand food and the smell of my ferrets feces has decreased and they don't eat as much of it, since it doesn't have all of the fillers like other brands do. Plus the price is great! The same bag is twice as much at Petco!",5
Great muzzle,5
I knew it was made out of recycling items but underestimated how cheaply assembled it is -- its just pure cardboard glued together. Promptly returned. This item is #1 as a CATNIP item -- not scratching post. You have to sprinkle catnip on the board otherwise your cat won't scratch it -- at least mine didn't. Terrible product -- just spend the extra money to get a legitimate scratching post. That's what I'm going to do now that I got a refund.,1
Good cat litter.,4
"I was surprised at how I could smell the clay.  I have the litter box in a spare bedroom and yet I could smell the clay in the livingroom.  Also, every time after scooping I felt I had the clay dust in my nose.  The clumping feature is excellent.  I'm going to try mixing some of this with the Walnut Litter I have.  Maybe if I combine the two I won't get as much order.  I have always loved World's Best Litter, but the mice that get into my house think it's wonderful food (made from corn) so I have to stop using that litter.  This little is definitely not dust free but it is minimum compared to some.",3
"Started taking our 8 year old up and down stairs for a new beach condo and long walks on the beach - noticed signs of muscle weakness. Started giving her these and within 2 weeks, saw a noticeable difference.  She does not miss a dose because they work so well for her.  She takes them right out of our hands so they must smell good to her",5
Gave my dog diarrhea!  Thanks for the vet bill!,1
Very nice scissors. Very sharp and looks like they will stay that way for quite awhile. Glad I bought.,5
"AWESOME!  It is going to take her a long time to get to the point where I have to take it away.  2 year old, 80 lb rottie.

Update:  She LOVED this bone but she ended up chewing the bone end of the leg to a pretty narrow point.  I had to take it away from her.  Because of that, I won't buy it again.",4
Good product,5
Fantastic quality. Well designed. Sturdy. My only gripe would be the screen top. It seems rather thin and delicate. I am going to brace the heat lamp rather than set it directly on top. Overall I would purchase again.,5
My french bulldog loves this food. We had go this pack for him to try adn we went back and bought a large bag after. We got this food do to the limited ingredients. Our frenchie does have some allergies but with this food he has been fine. Noticed his coat has gotten softer as well. We mix this food with dry dog food.,5
I was disappointed in the ingredients and I've switched to a more expensive dog food.,2
Dog really likes them and that is what counts,5
Adorable!,5
It's doggy shampoo and it's fine.,5
"I haven't even had this trolley exerciser a month, and it has broken in some way, shape, or form on six separate occasions. In fact, if it weren't for the handy resourcefulness of my father, I would have already thrown it away. I purchased this specific product because it said ""heavy weight,"" but that was a misconception on my part. The trolley system did not stand up to even moderate use from my 75 lb. rescue pup.",2
Every dog owner should have one!!!! Saves $$$,5
"My dogs play hard with this ball all the time and except for a bit of slobber, it's none the worse for wear! They LOVE it!",5
"Works great on my Lab.  It's a little awkward to use because the Dyson hose is so stiff, but the dog doesn't mind it and it definitely got a lot of hair off of her.",5
Got my 5 mth old kitten from a shelter and started her on this. She liked it immediately and her coat is healthy and shiny. She is now a yr old and will be switching her to an adult formula by Science Diet. She never had any digestive or other issues with this formula.,5
This is my cat's favorite toy.  He tears through them as he gets a bit rough with them but it is worth the price to replace them regularly because it is the only toy he goes back to time after time.  I love that has the touch activated play setting so it does not continue to run around after he has stopped playing with it.  This saves the battery and my sanity!,5
Kind of wish I would've bought a lighter color. I bought the black one and it's fairly dark when the side doors are zipped up and the top as well. It's a really great little play pen for indoor/outdoor use. I only use it inside the house . I have 5 small dogs ranging from 7-18 lbs and they all fit comfortably in it.,5
sits nicely in corner so that the crickets can't get under or around it to hide and die.,5
The seller sent an email with tips and I responded with a few questions. They got right back to me and were very helpful. I've had aquariums for several yrs and have used all sorts of different filter medium. This one is far superior to most brands. Next filter change I'll post a pic. I have a ton of phosphates in my water and I get a lot of gook. I have clear tanks with the help of these and phasogaurd!,5
"I love Stella and Chewy's freeze dried food, and my cat especially loves this variety.  The only problem is that the patties crumble very easily and by the time the package arrives, there are about 3-4 ounces of crumbs.  My cat will eat a little of this mixed with water, but prefers it in a patty.  Though these are technically for dogs, my cat absolutely loves them, and they make up part of her diet.",4
"This is a ""Must-have""! for Planted Tank Keepers, yet has become hard to find over the past Year or so, I can only hope API continues to Produce this product.",5
"this is a pretty hardy toy. My english mastiffs can pretty much chew through anything if they wanted but they love having the squeakers on the end of every ""tentacle""",4
"Purchased this skimmer laong with a Tom's 80 GPH canister filter. This attachment allows you to draw water from the bottom and or the surface of your tank. I actually like this surface skimmer better than the one that came along with a more expensive filter I purchased and I intend to buy another one of these to hook to it. Never really considered the benefits of surface skimming until I had 2 tanks running (one with and one without surface skimmer). The difference is noticable, no more random floaties or rainbow slick floating on top of my water. I don't pretend to know what's in that oily looking stuff, but this skimmer catches it so the filter can trap it and that's gotta be a good thing for my fishes.",4
"I have a cat who is a princess.  When we travel, she travels.  This bag is perfect because I can fasten her safely in the car, wheel her behind me on walks, and carry her on my back when I need too.  I love the teachers, as I can hook her harness to one of them and not worry about her escaping.  This is very good, durable material.  I'm pleased.",5
"My large dogs love them. Hooves are not oily and do not smell as bad as other ones that I've bought in the past. Just be aware to take them away when the hooves get too small, as they are a choking hazard at that point. Wish I could buy these in bulk.",5
"Took a while for my dog to get use to it, it's really big for his size. It had a weird off-smell at first that I had to wash off and eventually my dog took a liking to it.",3
It's good.,4
"Great dog house! Sturdy, great looking, nice rich color and it's the perfect size which suits my two small dogs. I really like the (roof) top which easily lifts open. We lined the inside which helps keep the cold out on chilly days, since we opted not to add the vinyl door flaps. There was a missing base piece but we assembled without it and it seems to be holding just fine. I was a little hesitant about buying a dog house because my little dogs are used to hanging out indoors most of the day & sleep inside. I bought it for use in the patio/yard in order to leave them outside occasionally while running errands, & in case it gets chilly or windy while we're out. Well they didn't hesitate to jump right in to check it out immediately after we assembled it and they seem to enjoy going outside to lay in it even when we're home! I'm so pleased that they like it and I'm impressed with the quality especially for the price. Unbeatable!",5
My mice weren't too thrilled about this food.  Too many fillers of stuff they won't eat.,3
Better than the one that came with my invisible fence. The clip is secure and the collar can be cut to fit.,5
"I wanted to add a review for the timer since it was bundled on this product page:

I had used $5 timers with $6 dimmers for a while (cheapest I could find). Then I moved up to the Current USA Single Ramp Timers, which are twice the price of these and only have one ""On"" period. So I was very happy to find that NICREW had released some new timers at half the price of the ones I normally use.

The instructions were pretty good, but they leave out that the timer will start the next programmed section if using the ""Sunrise and Sunset"" mode. I programmed everything around 4pm so that the lights should have been on at 25% from noon to 5pm (L2). But when I saved my programming, the lights did not turn on until it hit my next programming section (L3) at 5pm. It's not an issue now that I understand it, but I thought it was broken at first.

I really like that I can get a 24-hour effect with the timer. While it doesn't let me control the colors of the light, it does let me run the light at different brightness levels throughout the day. So I can have the light turn on fairly dim in the morning to let me feed fish before going to work. Then I can have it off during the day until I get back home and it can turn on to max brightness then.

The ramp timer also seems to help the fish and shrimp a lot, especially newer ones. When the light suddenly turned on in the past, some of my fish or shrimp would be frightened and dart everywhere or even jump out of the tank. It was sad to lose a few fish and shrimp to that. Once I actually witnessed it, I've decided to only use ramp timers on all of my lights.

Overall, a very nice timer for a very nice price!

====================
Overall, this LED light gives new fish tank owners the best bang for the buck. The competing LED lights are all much more expensive and this LED light fits my tank great with its adjustable brackets that just rest on top of the fish tank cover. Mine is sitting comfortably on top of my Aqueon Versa glass lid and Aqueon 20g long tank.

I have been using this product on my fish tank for almost a month and it has been great! It illuminates my 20g long fish tank entirely and perfectly. I actually thought the tank had constant algae blooms before I got this light. But once I was able to light up the fish tank, I could tell that it was actually just the colors of surrounding objects causing the water in the clear tank to seem green.

In addition, my 5 plants (anubias nana, dwarf lily, temple plant, rosette sword, & java fern) have been prospering under this LED light in my low-tech tank as well. My dwarf lily actually grew 5 lily pads to the surface of my tank over the course of 2 weeks! To be fair, all of those plants are low to medium light.

Also, the customer service is amazing! I contacted them about the cost for a power adapter replacement for a light that was not under warranty and they responded within one day and are shipping me a free one!

The only thing I would change about this LED light is making it so the brackets do not slide out of the light. However, I would gladly settle for a lower price rather than that minor inconvenience that I only ran into while taking it out of its package.",5
Very soft and well made.  My Cavalier loves it.  Can easily wash pillow or just get a nice blanket after the pillow is shot.  Worth the money!,5
turtle needs it and works good,5
As advertised,5
"My dog loves these. He's a terrier, so he loves chewing and gnawing. This is a harmless yummy thing to chew on. My slippers and socks are safe now.",5
"My Pugs who are 18 and. 24 lbs, wear an extra large. And the head/chest area are barely adequet but fit well. Do like them a lot.",5
keeps my male peeing,5
My cat loves it!!! Doesn't tear apart and leave junk all over,4
"I like this harness for my miniature pinscher, who has a very sensitive skin, because the fabric is soft and non-irritating. The girth strap is adjustable for a comfortable fit, but the front portion is not. This has not been a problem for my dog. The harness washes well, and wears reasonably well. The black edge binding starts to come off after about two years of regular use.",4
"If my dog is going to get fleas, usually it will be in the summertime. I noticed him itching a little and decided to try this shampoo. I haven't found any fleas before, during, or after the bath. Still, it's a good preventative and sometimes it's difficult finding out if he does have fleas with his thick undercoat. Now, his hair feels soft and he hasn't been itching since I bathed him about 24 hours ago.

I wasn't that thrilled when I got this because almost half the bottle had leaked out. The top cap was loose. It would cost a couple pennies more to produce, but I think there should be some kind of seal under the cap. I also wasn't that crazy about the scent. I am a person that likes strong scents but in my own personal care items. I think a dog's sense of smell is much more developed and I hope the perfumey smell isn't bothering him.

Conclusion: I'm not 100% happy with this shampoo but I would still rate it as one of the better ones I've tried. I also really like how it's gentle enough for puppies and you can use it on cats and kittens too. I will probably try it again but if I get another leaking bottle may reevaluate that.",4
Really cool that I don't have to fill water as often and that it keeps filtering it so I don't have to worry about dumping and putting fresh water in. Makes a little too much noise when it's not completely full. This is a pro and con because you'll know when it needs filled... but it's annoying.,4
the best as always,5
My dog has stayed a very healthy weight on this food and has good overall health!,5
Works great but my dog doesn't like it,4
Smaller than anticipated,5
"Our two Boston's love these minimal ingredient, healthy snacks! It's a nice little change-up from their protein rich dog food. No complaints about the product. Just an FYI though, the image on the page shows quite a few treats inside the package. However, the packages are typically filled about halfway with treats. Still get a good amount for the money, but the image is a little deceiving.",5
"Our dog love this and have been on it for years.  Great product, good ingredients.  We add it to their home cooked food of kale, quinoa and sweet potato.",5
Like it for my big dog but the price is outrageous! What is one to do? It works for her and leaves her mobile. She is 11 years old and an Australian Shepherd.,4
"The turtles love these, but over priced for the amount of worms.  Keep browsing...",3
So far it has helped my pond fish some. He is still bloated but can swim straight for now. Not sure it will cure his problem or not but had to try something.,4
I have one of these and two of the larger ones.  They have been running great.  I love that they suck in water at the surface and remove any film that can occur.  The local pet store ran them all out on clearance and I bought them up.  They perform very well and I have them on three tanks as an auxiliary filter.  I highly recommend them.,5
Excellent product  Has help keep my dogs urinary tract  healthy for 2 years. easy to hide in the food. I recommend this to anyone whose pet has had any type of urinary issues?,5
My Doxies love this soft velvety bed. They have not chewed it and enjoy cuddling in it together. Washes well.,5
"Its OK, Easy to fill, but doesn't wobble well, sits on its side so its hard for the dog to really work it.",2
My cat loves these and doesn't even know the difference between the unhealthy cat treats and this! She loves them!,5
Doggies love their Kongs!,5
"Zoe is quite the picky beagle, but she also has some pretty severe food allergies that have recently worsened making the things she will eat AND not make her sick a little harder to find. Enter Whimzees! When we realized Greenies had ingredients causing her to have a severe allergic reaction, we took our vet's advice and began to investigate. I happened upon the Gator version of the Whimzee over at PetCo, brought it home and watched her happily chew on it for a lot longer than she ever worked on her greenies (which disappeared quickly).  We thought the Dental Stix might be a little better for her in the long run (especially as we could break them in half to last longer) and they were perfect!

Both myself, my fiance and our little Zoe highly recommend this product.",5
We purchased this toy because our dog played with it at a park with another large dog and had a blast.  They played keep away and tug.  This is one of the heaviest and toughest toys I found.  You do not want to play catch with it or have your dog try to catch it in the air as it is too heavy and could injure them. It is more for fetching and tugging.  I have to put ours away when we are done playing as my young lab likes to chew on it.  Our dog will only tug with other dogs she is comfortable with as their heads will be rather close with this toy.  This toy will last a long time and is great for large and/or tough dogs.,4
Needed a higher ph tester and the nitrate tester as well. This was a great value and does everything I need it to do.,5
my dog loves it so i do as well. expensive but worth it,5
"Who knew doggums would like liver? Crunchy treats for your larger Kong or break them in half. Undetectable liver doggie breath, get them when they are on their special price and you'll be saving money and making your pup a happy camper.",5
you will not regret your purchase of these!! We have purchased 6 of these in different sizes. They last forever. The cats love them. I leave them plugged in all the time. Cats use them summer and winter and will spend all day or night in them. I have had some for several years. I have vacuumed them and washed and dried them (not the heating pad). I don't think my cats would forgive me if I didn't keep them supplied. There has to be one for each cat.,5
The clumping is amazing but the odor control is unimpressive.,3
"It's a little flimsy, but makes for good beginner's car riding training, or if you'll only use this on rare occasions. I'd definitely invest in a higher quality car seat if you're looking for something more permanent and will use all the time.",3
"I love these, but my pup doesn't. She loves the Bristle Bone, but likes the Glucosamine & Chondroitin (joint health) refills.  You didn't have that particular ""flavor"", and I couldn't find anyone else that did. I won't purchase these again.",5
"Very easy to put on my dog and she doesn't mind it at all, this has stopped her pulling to the point that it is manageable.
I did not measure her prior to buying this, she is a 45lb mixed breed however she is muscular and chesty and this just barely fit her. It would be lovely if they come out with more sizes as this would not fit my larger dog, who doesn't really need one, but it would be helpful for other owners.

It's very nice looking and well made and the leash is comfortable to hold. I prefer a slightly thicker leash however I can switch leashes as needed depending on what I am doing with the dogs. Great deal considering I've paid more than $15 for a harness alone without a leash for my dogs in the past, and this is much better quality than many of the ones I have bought in the past.

Very easy to adjust the size. The ease of use of this harness makes it well worth it for the benefits of a no pull harness.

This is not a front clip harness, or a tightening front clip harness which are generally what someone would want in a no pull harness. This is a step in harness.

I recieved this item at a discount with a coupon code in exchange for my honest review",5
"Funny and cute, my dogs love to play with this toy.",5
"My dog loves these balls.  Throw them and she brings them back.  Lot's of fun!  Great quality, very good delivery and good packaging.",5
You definitely need clamps to keep it securely down but great for dropping in food or water without having to take off the entire top and move the clips around (and accidentally forget to replace them).,4
"I had no trouble from the seller.  This  a product I really love.  It works better that anything else.  I have 2 long haired cats that have a lot of fur balls .  It cleans the mess for my carpet with little trouble,  It is also the only thing I have found that takes ketchup, mustard and spagetti sauce out of my clothes.  Really a wonderful product.",5
Parrots love it!,5
I mix it with dry but the dogs like it.,4
"I love this small Chuckit launcher.  I have a larger one we use in the yard, but we like to take the dogs to the lake and the Weimaraner loves nothing more than to retrieve balls thrown in the water, especially if he has to swim to get them.

I throw like a girl, for the obvious reasons, and the ball didn't go nearly as far as Roscoe would like.  Once I got this little gem I can throw the ball way out there. The reward is a tired/happy dog.

This one is nice and small and is easy to bring on a walk. It holds standard size tennis balls, so you don't need to buy a special size or anything.",4
My minpin loves these treats.,4
"I was slightly hesitant to buy this, but with Prime I knew I could send it back I didn't like it. And I don't like it - I love it! While other parents are still digging in their pouches to get a treat out for their dogs during obedience class, my baby has already been rewarded.

The dispenser is very well made, I can fit almost an entire cup full of kibble in it (classes are almost an hour away and my puppy gets motion sickness so his dinner on those nights is his ""treat""), and I can count on getting 1-3 pieces of kibble with each quick squeeze.

My only dislike is the clip. Unlike another review whose dispenser kept falling off, mine is extremely difficult to get off. The problem is the bulkiness of the clip. I don't understand the need for the excessive extrusion on the top front of the clip - it could have been a little less bulky and still keep the clip from breaking. I also have never understood why clips, especially those that lay next to the skin, need to curve outward at the end.

I may try to find a better clip but I'm not interested in a belt carabiner/s-biner as others have suggested. I like that the current clip can slip over the waist band of my jeans - it keeps the pouch from swinging around and the dispenser is within easier reach.

Even if I can't find a better clip, this is by far the best reward dispenser I've ever seen - I have no hesitation in recommending it.",5
"This is the best scoopable litter I've ever used. Masks oders, smells piney fresh & is natural for my cat's feet. My greatest hope is that they use felled trees & sustainability when processing this product. I don't know if they do animal testing, but I should really find out, as I was disappointed to learn that other major brands do this.",5
"This cuts hair. Take some dental floss and pull down through the brush and watch it cut. That is the reason you ""think"" it works well because u get tons of fur. But you are simply messing up your kittys hair style. This thing made my long haired cat a short haired cat-that is not what I wanted. Buy a proper brush instead.",2
"This kennel seems to be very well built. However, the arms that are supposed to lock into place don't really lock and are just spring loaded. If the arms get loose the kennel could collapse on the pet inside. I had to add some rubber coated clamps to the kennel supports to keep the arms from sliding.",4
"Love these treats! I've had them for my dogs for years, and no matter the size of the dog, the Flavor Snacks are perfect for a quick treat. Don't know what makes them so appealing, but my babies would do back flips for one of them. I make sure they get a few with their dinner, and it's amazing ... no matter what other goodies are included in their dish, the very 1ST THING THEY GO FOR IS THE  MILK-BONE! I've been a satisfied customer for over 40 years and swear by these over any other newly invented treat with who knows what ingredients included, YUCK! No thanks, I'll stay with Milk-Bone, our trusted friend.",5
I bought this to replace the one I have had for 5 years .I think the old one just got wet one to many times. and in the summer daily swimming. Great product,5
I got this to try and see if my two dogs would actually drink more. It is a really nice system. My dogs love it. They were not scared of the noise at all. The noise is very minimal. It holds a lot of water.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.,5
Nice bowl.,5

My cat, Skippy, is almost 3 years old and when we first received the tunnel he wasn't so sure about it. I placed a treat inside and once he got use to the crackling noise he began crawling through the tunnel. He is now playing with the ball frequently. He hasn't attempted to go through the hole on the side, though. In the advertising picture it shows the ball hanging. I was under the assumption it might be weighted to keep the ball hanging, but it is not. Most of the time, the ball is laying on the floor. To my cat, Skippy, the ball isn't as interesting lying on the ground as it is hanging and swinging. I have to prop up the tunnel to keep him interested. Overall, it is made well and I do not see any structural flaws or seam separations. I think it's a nice toy at a good price! Given lower rate for testing and review. I do not promise 5 star ratings and these are my own opinions.",4
"I give it 4 stars because I don't really know yet how it agrees with my little dogs.  Suffice it to say that I was looking for small kibble bites suitable for small breed (mine are mini doxies) and of senior age.  So far so good, they like it, but then they like anything and everything that is edible.  The ingredients certainly seem to be of high quality.  So you can appreciate my dilemma while rating this food.  A dog website that I came across some months ago rated the Wellness brand with the most stars.  Sorry I don't remember the name nor the number of stars.  The bags came well packed and promptly.  I only wish this dog food were less expensive on Amazon; the only thing I save over my local pet shop is a few %points of sales tax and gas costs for not having to drive to purchase the product.",4
Safe & great product!! Works well for our dogs. Will always keep in stock for our home. Easy to use. No side effects at all.,5
Thanks again,5
"After struggling with my senior cat's allergies for years and seeing multiple vets (including specialists) who all recommended different long-term, side-effect-heavy medications and increasingly expensive foods (none of which my cat would eat), one vet suggested we try Fancy Feast so I did and here I am writing a five star review. Beef is my cat's flavor of choice and she eats her bowl of food with enthusiasm. It's helped her go from utter misery to now only having the occasional flare-up so as far as I'm concerned, ""magic"" should be listed in the ingredients. I appreciate that it's a fairly cheap, easily obtained brand as well. As far as cat food goes, it smells about average (bad) but my cats don't seem to mind and the texture has a little more looseness and liquid than some of the other Fancy Feast flavors which can be very firm and dry. My cats also appreciate that there aren't any chunks since the varieties with recognizable pieces (like the shrimp/fish flavor) or the kind with the little rectangular bits are a no and will sit in their bowls all day long. Amazon's price is a little bit cheaper than what I've found in the big box pet supply shops in my area so I appreciate getting a bargain along with having it delivered. Unless my allergic cat suddenly starts reacting to this food or decides she doesn't like it, we're loyal beef-flavored Fancy Feast purchasers.",5
"They eat them like crazy. It did take a few days for them to realize they were food. But, once they did, they always break them up or finish them.",5
"My dogs neck measures 16.5 inches and this collar fits her perfectly, the only weakness I find is the buckle and the ring are right next to each other which makes it more difficult to attach the leash to an excited dog.  The collar looks well made otherwise..",5
Cute for me- Pitty loves it.,5
"This is a wonderful way to give birdie millet, it makes it alot easier for the bird to eat the millet, so glad I found this product!",5
I am shocked how well this works. I was very skeptical but I am now a believer!,5
Dogs luv them,5
Strong toy. Holds up to my 100 pound German Shepherd chewing on it.,5
"We had to take our cat to the vet because he was getting scabs, losing hair, his urethra was swollen, and he just generally looked like crap. The vet said he had allergies, but didn't have fleas... So, we decided to start with changing his food. This is the first food we tried and it worked great! His hair started coming back, scabs were going away. Then we ran out and switched to another food... and it all happened again. So, apparently this is the brand for us! We just wish it came in bigger bags!",5
Smells good!,5
Well made leash and very comfortable in the hand.,5
"This is a good priced grab bag for toys that would otherwise cost at least $0.75 each in my local pet store. There were plenty of balls and mice, which my kitten loves chasing and always manages to either destroy or lose under the couch or refrigerator. Good thing they're cheap! I likely be buying more in the future.",5
"OK, he's look like a some kind of odd toy. But you know what? They really work. I've had 3 ticks on me since I got these and they all came off very easily. And, more importantly, completely (still alive and ready to be flamed up). If you can reach it, it will work.",5
"Product is advertised as packaged with label from manufacturer, however, when I received the 3 bully rings, they were individually wrapped in a old looking greenish baggie and taped. I dropped one when I was unwrapping it and my dogs sniffed it and left it alone, they were not interested. I would not give my dogs something that looked like it was packaged in somebody's garage. I threw the rings away being unsure of where they came from and what exact brand or where they were made.",1
I use this to give my pet rats baths once a week. It smells great and leaves their fur shiny and super soft. I've had several vets over the years and they have all been amazed by how healthy their coats are.,5
Love this litter box between the pellets the liner and all the stuff that you can get it's a breeze to clean my litter box the only thing is I wish it was a little longer and the sides or a little higher I have a very large cat.,5
"Need a large quantity so I don't have to go to the pet store so much.  Surprise, found them on Amazon.  Great.",5
"I researcher tons of automatic feeders before purchasing this one. It is not the easiest to set, in my opinion, but it works exactly as programmed. My cat no longer howls for food. She knows exactly when her next meal is.",5
"Cans arrived dented,  I don't use that for my dogs. Can't tell if it has been contaminated.  Won't order anymore",1
Took some getting used to this leash but the learning curve is over and I really like it.,5
Bought this as a gift for a doggie friend. He loves it and it's his new favorite toy. Until he sees a squirrel or something shiny.,5
"I tried using many other brands of carbon, charcoal, resins, removers, etc.  None of them compare to this blend, for freshwater aquariums it is great, not sure about marine environments.

The product is quite pricey if purchased at local pet stores, I order online and save about 30%.  I rinse the packet under fresh tap water a few times weekly and replace it every 3-4 weeks depending upon waste load in my tanks.  It is currently installed in a Fluval C4 H.O.B. filter and have great success with it.",5
This product is awesome! It is a body massage for your pet while in the tub and when they are dry. It releases shedding hair.,5
"I measured my 6 months pom and got a small one for him and it works perfect! I was a little worried if it's gonna be too small bc my pom is a little over weight (8 lbs), but it turned out fine. It's soft and adjustable, and the blue color is vivid and nice.",5
Dogs love them and its good for their coats.  Bit smelly but that's expected being fish skin kinda would be worried if they did not. Nice treat that they enjoy.,5
My dog loves her blanket. This blanket is super soft and warm.,5
"love the brand, not liking this scent",4
"One doesn't really know if they work, does one?",4
"Very happy with this item. It took my cat about a week to figure out it was her scratching post, so have patience if it takes a while. I rubbed catnip all over it, which seemed to help. It's compact, so it fits in small places. I've only had it for a few months, so I can't speak to long-term durability. But, it's been awesome so far. My cat loves it and doesn't scratch up any other item/furniture. Very pleased/highly recommend. If it meets an early demise, I'll repost and change my review accordingly.",5
"This stuff is the most expensive out there for a reason - it works. My dog's elbow clicks less when he's on it at 1 per day (85 lbs, has elbow dysplasia and early arthritis).",5
Great product for heavy duty chewers.,5
"I love this leash for walking. It's comfortable to hold, a perfect length, and I can wrap it around my wrist easily. My only complaint is that one of the first ones we purchased broke after a while. The clip that holds it to the collar kept falling off of my dog's collar when we were walking. I bought another of this same leash because I liked it so much, but if it happens with this one I'll have to try a different leash.",4
"I've ordered these a few times and so far so good. They are on the thin side but I'm picking up poop, not anvils so it works just fine.",5
These look super in a tank!,5
"These are great dog chains, but are a little heavier than I expected. My dogs are 13 and 21 pounds so they are smaller dogs but the chains work great.",5
"My dog loves these.  Not too sure how safe/good they are for her, but I haven't had any problems.  My dog tends to leave pieces of these all over the house, and it hurts when I step on the hardened remains.  Other than that it seem highly digestable, and will keep my 9.5 lb dog occupied for about 45 minutes.",5
"Thanks Kong for the cute CAT toy.
Christmas toy for my furkids.
Fast delivery.
Sturdy material.",5
This wasn't that bad of a filter for a small tank but i had a 55 gl tank and it was too much cleaning for me to do ever 2 weeks. I instead bought a more expensive filtration filter that i didn't have to clean so often,4
As advertised. Great value. Bully sticks last a long time and not hollow like some others. My dog who is an aggressive chewer had one last 45 minutes. This is a great quality product.,5
"Great product, inexpensive and durable.",5
"The main reason we purchased this was for the brush attachment, but I really hate the bristles/brush/comb on this apparatus. The bristles are thin, sharp metal pieces, and do not pick up any hair like a brush should, it's about as good as running your fingers through your dogs coat. On top of that, it's uncomfortable for the dog since they're so sharp. The idea is great, but the brush really needs to be made better, otherwise it defeats the purpose.",3
love this brand,5
"We have used everything from over the counter vitamins to shots from the vet. Finally a product that is easy to administer to one that our older cat has shown positive results. She's more alert, playful and seems happier overall. The brightness has returned to her eyes.",5
It works well on my dog,5
What a great deal!  We bought these mini tennis balls for our ferret because they have a bell inside and are easy for her to pick up.,5
I use these as training treats for my Maltipoo. I break them in 1/2 or thirds for quick behavior reinforcement. They are grain free and nutritious so I use them as a regular supplement to her grain free diet and adjust the total kibble accordingly. To save money I order 2 of each flavor when I spend $25 on something else. That way I can get at 1/2 price.,5
"My dogs like these, but they are the smallest treats I've ever seen. They are definitely not a full ""bite"". I even have to give my 15 lb. dog more than one.",3
"If you own a dog you should have this on hand.
Clears hotspots very quickly.
Amazing results for yeast infection in my golden retriever's ear.
Countless trips to the vet and multiple expensive prescriptions didn't clear her yeast infection.
Her ears were hot, red, swollen, itchy and smelly.
Several applications of nustock and the yeast infection disappeared.
Fantastic product.",5
"We purchased this for our newer Cat-It fountain, the one that supposed to take the water-softening cartridges (which are more expensive and harder to find) and while they're made for the older version of the Cat-It (our quit after I let it run dry one too many times!) it works pretty well even if it's not the exact right one for our fountain.",4
"This is by far the best crate I've ever bought. I just got two new American bulldog/mix rescue pups, and needed to get a second crate. When this arrived, it was surprisingly so large that both puppies still fit in very well, which makes us all happy. Very well constructed, easy to put together and take down as needed, and easy to open and close. Would very highly recommend.",5
"Much better than I was expecting! For the price I was expecting a lesser quality item, but this far exceeded those expectations! Very durable, seemingly waterproof (haven't really tested it), and great for keeping my pups from falling off the seat or getting it dirty from our adventures.",5
"I train and have worked with Rottweilers and large breed foster dogs (Mastiffs, DDB's etc) for over 15 years. I have always had the hard Jolly Pet balls in various sizes over the years for the big dogs to play with. Most (around 85%) Love these, especially if you put something inside of them (A few pieces of gravel, or water or especially some sand) that make it make a noise or roll erratically. That seems to really get the pets attention.

Most ""little dogs"" I've met seem unimpressed by these, but really big dogs for some reason seem to really like them. The are for sure OUTDOOR ONLY toys! They are made of a very sturdy ""hard"" plastic therefore cannot really be punctured or ""deflated"" (assuming you get the correct size for your dog). Most of my dogs like to play soccer with these or just ram them around with their noses, a few like my current rottie pup live to put their paws on the thing and launch it out from under/behind them. They also work really well with dogs who normally have a high play/prey drive (those that could fetch a stick or ball all day long *smile*)

When introducing your pet to this ""a little bit goes a long way"". Meaning I let them only play with it maybe a minute or two then take it away leaving them ""wanting more"". Like any toy if you just leave it constantly in the back yard most dogs will eventually get bored of it, also it is a fun interactive toy for you and your dog. Kick it gently and play ""dog soccer"" pick it up and roll it (never TOSS it as this can hurt the dog). For really strong breeds, fill it with water or heavy sand (or sand AND water). Praise your dog and get ""excited"" and play with them with this. That usually always will make them get interested in this toy.

Also as many others have written in their reviews, many dogs will ""chew a groove"" near the recessed port and the plastic in order to carry this ball around. It's Okay. I let my dogs get this groove in the ball, they often seem so proud to pick it up and carry it around!

I love these and always will, it's a great product that I have used over the years to make dogs feel comfortable, to reward them after training sessions (their ""special toy"") and to expose dogs who were fearful to ""new things"".  Why these hard plastic toys seem so irresistible to most dogs I don't know. But I truly like mine, and most importantly so do most of the dogs I own or foster.",5
"I try (which means it doesn't always happen) to scale my yorkie's teeth each evening, followed by brushing with this toothpaste using a tiny toothbrush, followed by a dental spray.  It all seems to work fine, her teeth are sparkling white and free of scale and her breath is great.  She tolerates the scaling, chews the toothbrush with this toothpaste on it, and doesn't really like the spray.  But this toothpaste is a perfect 5 star product!",5
"We are in the process of transitioning an abandoned cat from being entirely outdoors to entirely indoors.  At this point, though, he's only willing to stay inside all night now and then.  As we live in a state that gets very cold at night, we needed a way to protect him from the dropping temperatures.  We have a solid, cat-sized wooden house, but that wasn't going to be enough, even with bedding.  This heating pad has worked perfectly!  The cat took readily to using the house with the pad, and appears at the door every morning looking happy and healthy.  I couldn't place the house right by the outdoor outlet, so I used a heavy-duty extension cord and purchased a connection cover.  (Farm Innovators Cord Connect Water-Tight Cord Lock, also purchased from Amazon.)

I'm very pleased with this purchase, and the price I got here beat every other price I found for the identical item by at least 20%.",5
AS DESCRIBED,4
My dogs like this toy. I know it will only last so long if they decide to chew on it. It does work very well for playing fetch since it's squishy. I haven't broke anything in the house yet. The dogs seem to enjoy grabbing it and giving it the death shake and then letting it fly mid shake. It goes sailing through the room and then they go chase it and do it again.,5
"Put this in my leopard gecko's cage, and he loves it. I read other reviews about how if you weren't careful you could get their toes or tail stuck. I carefully read the directions and as long as the ground is completely level, the rock will not move! Love it!",5
"So far so good, I have an Aussie and it's important to keep his ears clean. I actually only bought this cause I saw Life With Aspen and her owner used this product. 10/10 would recommend.",5
"I just received this harness a few weeks ago for my pug.  My first ever pug! When he pulls we don't have to worry about him choking like they do on regular collars (which I have read is not good for them)  It is soft, and very easy to figure out, unlike some harnesses.  Great product!",5
Good food. Fish eat it,5
I had previously bought 50pounds of another brand and my three little yappers  had not liked it very much.when I started mixing Hills with the other brand they ate all of the food The Hills has a chocolate smell reminds me of coco puffs.paulgeorge123@comcast.net,5
"I got baby chicks because of this toy!!
They made a nest in it, and now I have 5 parakeets instead of 2...",5
"My dog only eats this if I force him to do so. The sticks are very hard, making it not easy to be cut up into small pieces.",3
Medium is the perfect size for my 70 pound Boxer and I no longer come home with a dislocated shoulder.  Highly recommend.,5
"I have a dog with allergies, and she eats the Natural balance sweet potato fish dog food. So glad to find there is a dog treat available that goes right along with her anti-allergy diet.  And she really likes them!",5
"I have never not had a cat in my life. I have been cleaning up after them since I was old enough to clean out a litter box and I have to say this is the best system ever. I currently have three cats and for the past 5 years have been getting away with having only one litter box in a one bedroom apartment!! (I know this was very lucky) After my 13 year old decided to start pooping and peeing regularly in my very small kitchen I knew I needed to get another box, seeing as the rule of thumb is ""one box per cat PLUS one"".I didn't like the idea of having  dusty litter in my kitchen so I looked into other pelleted forms of litter. I foudn the Breeze system online and after going back and forth for a week finally purchased it. I am so happy I did because all three cats took ot it very well!! I have towo boxes. One covered and one not. The pellets last for about 3-4 weeks before I change them. The litter pads I usually change every 7-10 days in each box. Sometimes they use one box more for urinating and the other more for pooing  Anyway, I hardly smell anything and there is ZERO DUST to sweep up. Although the pellets do get thrown out of the box sometimes and one kitty plays with them...they are easy to sweep up. LOVE THIS LITTER SYSTEM AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!",5
Great deal.,5
Very nice effective pump.,5
As described.  Fish seem to enjoy swimming against the current created.,5
My dogs won't mess with it. I don't know why but they don't like the Kong rubber.,1
"Much better than Pill Pockets!  Wish I could still get them in the store.  They are Corn, What, Soy free!",5
Didn't go with our decor so returned it.  It fits a gallon so reasonably sized.  It was kind of hard for us to remove the bottle without getting a workout in so this is the primary reason we returned it.  Stainless so in theory no rust over time.  If the bottle screwed on instead of snapping on we probably would have kept it.,4
Done just fine and measured exactly what I needed :),4
"Would love an even larger one, as I have a 15 pound Norwegian Forest Cat that takes long steps.  This wonderful mat collects 75% of the litter droppings.  Just a bit larger would catch it all.  Love this mat because it reduced the messy droppings and is very easy to clean.  I clean his litter box every week and this gets a shake off, then a hosing with hot water in the tub.  It dries quickly as I live in Arizona.  Saves a lot of sweeping and looks very nice under the light blue litter box.  My cat is a boy cat so blue is perfect.",5
One of my pet pals favorite treats.,5
Birds love it.,5
I don't know what I would have done without this. I had the hang on back filter and LOVE this. You HAVE to get this filter!,5
I think it helps for the density of stool and the digestion.,5
"This is so much better than the ones I find at other stores. Thicker and lasts longer, not flimsy. Fits perfectly in my dog's kennel.",5
"Pupper had surgery and have to give her 4 pills 3 times a day.  Needless to say, these made getting her to take them way easier than trying to hide pills in cheese or peanut butter!",5
I had high hopes for this litter box as I was not able to get an electric one for where I wanted to place the box. The premise is good and the solid waste does fall in to the tray when you roll it on its side but the wet mess stays clumped to the bottom and I have to scoop and scrape anyway. I used the recommended litter but still have this issue and I clean it daily. Another problem is that it does require some strength to completely turn the litter box onto its top and then back again to evenly distribute the litter. I'm thinking I might have been better off just purchasing a regular litter box and scoop.,3
"My cats have healthy, shiny coats on this food, with minimal shedding. My older cat lost the bald spot on her back on this food. I'm pleased.",5
"Heard about this product and thought I'd give it a try for my three active dogs, two of which are 9. Not an easy choice as I have a cabinet full of similar options. The dogs do very well on this product and I have been pleasantly surprised. One, however, does not like the taste and I have to go through great pains to mask it with salmon oil or peanut butter. Overall I'd say it has helped the two of them deal with the aches and pains of getting older as moderate lameness in their rear leg.

"I have an aussie that loves to occupy her days ripping the stuffing out of toys and than keeping the squeaker as a trophy. I have purchased numerous Sikinneez toys and they do the trick for us. She loves to flop them around and shake them. We also play tug of war there is a bit of stretch to the toy and I am big guy and the toys take a beating when we play. I wish there was a bit more weight to them so we could play fetch sadly when i throw the toy it only goes about 10 feet. I have used several other brands of toys, kong and american kennely club and the Skinneez toys have lasted the longest.",5
"I have no clue what it is about this treat, but my frenchie will do anything you ask him to do to get this.",5
I have ordered so many differen Uvb lights from Amazon and consistently have a problem with them not working/burning out quickly. These lights have all held up. This will be my product of choice from here on out.,5
"Works well. Bought the Classic 26M and works well but I have to hold it with two hands when throwing because the ball wouldn't release with me holding by just one hand. The grip was too strong, so by having two hands, it stops the motion abruptly, which cause the ball to fling out of the holder. But I can't complain. It does what it should do.. :) Maybe I'm just lazy by wanting to only use one hand to do the work. My dog loves playing fetch!",4
"My old Momma Kitty, had been having a bit of trouble jumping up as high as she used to. So, I got her these. She loves the flavor and eats them right up. I've been giving her 2 of these a day for a few weeks and it seems to help her, as I haven't seen her miss her mark jumping up high any more.

I'd definitely recommend these, it surely cannot hurt.",5
"My 30lb terrier bit through the fabric in five minutes and removed two of the squeakers after another 15 minutes. When all the squeakers come out, we may use this as a tug-of-war toy.",2
"We bought this fountain after reading Amazon reviews that said it was relatively quiet. This was definitely not our experience. I fiddled with it for about an hour trying to get the parts to fit as tightly as possible, as previous reviewers have suggested, but that did not work for us. The motor still buzzed like a lawnmower.",2
Perfect price!,5
"The fountain is pretty good at its' job. My cat was a little afraid of it at first, but has no problems drinking from it now. It's a little louder than I was hoping for, but I can't complain much about it - it's a motor, after all.",4
"Our 4lb chihuahua loves the BLUE Wilderness High Protein Grain Free Adult Dry Dog Food. It's small enough for her to chew on and eat. I know she loves it because I bought the Amazon pet food/snack sample promo the other month when they gave you credit back for the whole amount, and I ended up with a bunch of dog snack packs as well as small sample packets of dog food from other big brands. I didn't want to give her a stomach issue so I mixed them into the Blue Wilderness dog food, and she ended up sifting through it with her nose and not eating the other one, it was kind of funny.

It's good quality dog food, and I will continue to buy the Blue brands.",5
"The collar is as described and we were pretty excited to try it on our semi-vocal 1-year old Great Dane.  Unfortunately, as other reviewers have mentioned, he was sprayed twice within 10 minutes of wearing the collar WITHOUT barking.  The first time, he shook his head and flapped his ears, and was sprayed.  The second time, he was rolling on the ground and was sprayed.  Not wearing any other collar.  Poor guy was so confused so we removed the collar.  If the point of the collar is negative reinforcement, which makes sense with barking, we can't take the risk of negatively reinforcing normal dog behavior and confusing our dog while trying to train him.  I would call this product defective.  Buyers, also note that this product is NOT returnable from Amazon.  On that same note, Amazon is awesome and has wonderful customer service. :)",2
"My cats really love I and love and you can food, and they are quite picky. It's a decent brand, ingredients are good and it isn't too pricey, so I feel good about buying it for them.",5
"Now that I live in Texas, the sidewalks are not salted and my dogs' paws are no longer damaged by winter weather. My little guy has some sort of allergy and will chew his paws In the summer. This helped moisturize the pads and gave him relief until his paws healed.
My five star review is also for how wonderful it worked on my hands. I suffer from peeling and cracked skin on my fingers. I've tried so many lotions and potions, creams, gloved hands at night, trips to the dermatologist and steroid creams... nothing helped. I had a bad flare-up recently. The tin of Paw Guard just seemed to magically appear when my hands hurt the most. I never thought to try it on myself until I got to the desperate ""why not"" moment.
It worked. Within 2 days, the skin breaks softened up. A week later, I am almost free of the peeling, cracked and split skin.
Who-da thunk?",5
"Even though it could make your dog nervous at times, my to big dogs adjusted to it and are way more attentive when wearing the collar.",5
work great,5
"How the heck do you go wrong!!?!! Even if you get more bully sticks in one bag than another, the price far out ways that fact! I am so excited to find this product that I am beside myself. My dogs love it, and we are talking a bit over 3 bucks a pound SHIPPED!! Is it a dream!?!",5
"This bowl is great.  It's durable, easy to clean, and the design on the outside is good quality.  We purchased this for our larger mixed breed dog and she eats out of it with no issues.  Our smaller pug likes to sneak food out of it, as well, and she doesn't have any problems, either.  This can work for short or longer nose breeds and it's very cute.  I also love that the ring on the bottom (to prevent sliding) is removable for cleaning purposes.",5
"We bought the squirrel toy for our Beagles, who are taunted by real squirrels that sit just beyond the Invisible Fence and call to them.  Our dogs love it and carry it around the house.  It's the only stuffed dog toy we've purchased that our Beagles haven't immediately torn apart.  We also bought two for family members who each have a Black Lab.  One Lab still plays with it, and the other destroyed it within minutes.  So... no guarantee your dog won't tear into it, but we're three for four.  My Beagles also like the bunny toy...as bunnies also taught them from just beyond the reach of the Invisible Fence.  Great dog toys.",5
"My cats use this in different ways. At first I thought they would just lounge on it and scratch but there's a feather toy that dangles down. They love to dash and dive under to attack the toy. The smaller of my cats lays on it lengthwise and my larger cat lays on it width-wise. They both do use it for scratching so that's a success as well. If anything, I think it could be a little bigger, but they use it just fine. It also doesn't take up much space in the house. The construction is good as they haven't pulled it apart and it still looks great.",4
"I've got several 48"" three door Ultima crates that came with very flimsy plastic trays that long ago split from the weight of some dogs. I ended up putting very thin particle type boards under the those trays, this helped but the splits were still there. I came across these when a client had the same problem and asked me to help. During my search i came across this product. I was reluctant at first, some previous reviews stated slight sizing problems but they were able to overcome those. I had the same problem, but i did get this new tray installed correctly but not without some extra effort. I'm not sure how difficult it will be to remove IF/When that becomes necessary. But right now, when i need to use these kennels any liquids are not going to seep through the old trays cracks!

I don't generally kennel dogs but it is necessary under certain circumstances such as, they are not reliably house-trained, other issues, chewing, as part of a separation anxiety training program ,and feeding multiple dogs. If your dog is destructive and suffers from anxiety issues related to confinement and/or being alone, this product will likely not hold up for these dogs. If your dog is suffering from any of these issues or related, you should seek help from a qualified behavior specialist and/or veterinary behaviorist. 8-)",4
Fantastic food. My dogs both love it. One dog has grain reactions and has no trouble when on this diet.,5
"After reading many of the reviews of this product I was a little skeptical of ordering it. When it came today my concerns were unfounded.  It was very easy to set up,  straps work fine,  fits the 8 panel play pen perfectly. I'm using this exclusively for travel so I don't know how it would hold up to everyday use, but for what I need it for I would highly recommend. The bunnys seen to approve too!  For 20.00 bucks or so, give it a try.",5
"We got this for our two cats, ages 6 and 7 who love being brushed. We thought this might give them another option when we're busy. We've had it for about a week now and neither one has shown an interest in it. It's big enough for our 17 pound cat to fit through, and well enough made. It has rubber nibs on the inside and outside of the arch to rub against, but so far no activity. We're still hopeful that in time one of them will give it a try.  If not, I'll give it to a friend who has little kitties. They'll play with anything!",2
Great tooth brushes.  They do the job and I love that they come in two colors.,4
"This is a great gate, installed it on my deck.  Love it .",5
"Rating system does not tell this tale.

If I could: 5-stars for effectiveness.  1-star for durability and design.

CONS:
- Needs re-adjustment and attention during use to be sure the strap over the muzzle has not come loose
- While your dog is in the ""getting used to this gizmo"" phase he has a good chance of being bothered enough by the muzzle strap to actually get it off his nose.  (Neck strap will stay attached so you won't lose the dog but you will no longer have the benefit of the tool)
- Not durable: clasp that is supposed to keep the adjustable muzzle strap in place and at the length you set will break over time - not necessarily break off but will most likely no longer hold your intended adjustment in place.  When this happens, your dog will have an even easier time getting the muzzle strap off.  At a minimum, the Gentle Leader will no longer function as well as it would otherwise
-Fitting your dog and getting the thing on and off your dog: NOT as easy an intuitive as other products.  REQUIRES you pay very close attention and almost always have to re-adjust when putting on the dog. Not a user friendly design

PROS:
- GREAT tool when used correctly and BEFORE the muzzle strap clasp becomes faulty.

And alternative head collar: Holt Head Collar aka Halti aka Coastal Walk'n Train Head Halter. [These are identical products.]
- my dog finds it more comfortable
- is a much tougher more durable design
- muzzle strap clasp is hefty and works very well ( you do not have to be fiddling with it or checking in to see if it needs adjustment constantly)
- more intuitive and far easier to get on and off

Regarding the Holt, so far my guy has not succeeded in dislodging the muzzle strap or changing the strap's adjustment.  However, you will have to confirm neck strap adjustment when putting it on but this is a fast and easy task that does not require constant fiddling. Once the tool is in place it's a one and done and does not need constant management.",3
"I just shaved our Himalayan female and it is still cold.  Dogs wear them so I thought, why not for a cat.  This small size fit her perfectly as she is not a hug cat and weighs about 7lbs.  She seems to appreciate it and did not even try to get it off.  I never thought I would have a cat that wore clothes but hey, she is liking it after having a mass of hair removed!",5
"Both of my cats absolutely love this! It's the first toy that they've both shown an interest in, thank goodness I ordered 2 of them!",5
"My little Chihuahua, Peanut, absolutely loves this bed!  She has many choices of sleeping and lounging furniture, both dog designed and human.  But her go-to favorite is this wonderful bed that is both well made and inexpensive.  The hood is easily removed, if need be, as is the mattress.  There's not one thing I would change about this product.",5
Too big for easy scooping out of my seed bin.,2
"My mini schnauzer puppy has a few dozens of toys, and this was one of his most favorite ones. I guess it's time to switch to stuffing free toys!  He's only 5 months old and 10 pounds. Not as durable as I hoped a Kong toy would be. He still has the monkey and the croc ones though.",3
"*Update* We continue to be so pleased with this harness that I bought a second for our bully-bodied girl. Its just perfect. The original that I bought a year ago is still going strong, but I needed an a second for when she rolls around in the yard & I need to wash the harness. Ive popped it in the dryer a couple of times to speed dry time rather than air dry, but I cant imagine thats good for the buckles or the life of the harness in general. While the price point is still amazing for what we receive, I cant see destroying it for no reason by using my dryer on it repeatedly. So we have a backup only for that reason bc our girl finds the grossest, smelliest spots to roll when shes on her lead. Thanks Yogadog for continuing to make an amazing product!

(Please note this & all of my reviews are of my own accord & are not paid for, nor are free products given.)

We are so pleased with this harness. We have a 48lb mixed breed dog whose body is best described as a bully body type (think short Staffordshire bull terrier, English bull dog, etc). Her neck is 17 inches, chest is 29.5 inches, and her length from base of neck to tail is 20.5 inches. I ordered a size large harness, which is perfect after adjusting it.

We adopted this girl at 4 years old & while she's well trained inside the house, her leash walking skills were poor bc of pulling. She had been underfed & as she's gained weight & become healthy, she has also become stronger than she seemed to realize she would be & I found I was being dragged around. This harness has stopped all of that. It's on the heavy side, though she can still run in the yard on her long-line leash with no trouble at all. The weight seems to help her from trying to run past the limit in fact, which is great for both of us.
The handle has been a blessing at times when I need an additional grip beyond just the leash, for example when my neighbors chickens escaped their coop while we happened to be outside playing.
My one recommendation to YogaDog is to please consider adding color &/or pattern options to their product line. My reason for this is bc I personally adopt black dogs intentionally since they sit in shelters longer than others, if they ever find a home. This is my first dog who truly looks like what people consider to be a pitbull & the fact that she is a black dog apparently elicits additional fear. When my girl was still underweight I had a ""frilly"" looking harness for her which made her seem much more approachable to people. I had an incredibly hard time finding just a plain harness as it was that would fit her proper, healthy size. By this I mean one that is not covered in spikes or anything resembling hunting attire. It would go a long way to be able to ""dress"" my very sweet dog in a way that would make people subconsciously see her as the sweet cuddle bug that she is.
I'm hoping to update with a better picture soon but the only one I have at this time is while recently cleaning out my car when my pup was on her loose leash & jumped into my trunk to ""help"" clean.",5
"Though the fragrance is not bad, this stuff is so heavily perfumed that my dog absolutely can't stand it. I sprayed some on my arm, then washed it, & it STILL reeked of ""lavender mint"" all day. I feel guilty for having so annoyed my dog by trying it out on him. Incidentally, it doesn't detangle particularly well either.",1
These have a very strong salmon scent which dogs LOVE. They can be a bit much for anyone who is offended by fish scent but they are natural and a good treat.,5
"Accurate. Just place the sensor end into the intake portion or sump or wherever you want it and it works great.  Not sure how long the battery ( included) will last yet, but the last one I had lasted as long as the tank was around",5
Our 8 yo tuxedo cat Bailey loves these tools. He only uses these items to stretch and wear out his front claws. Well worth the purchase.,5
Workk good,4
"We have a dog with renal disease and it is very important for her to eat her renal food, which she will only do if is mixed in with Cesar's.  We've tried mixing it with other quality dog foods, but she turns away from the bowl.  We love her and would buy her any food that she'll eat.  It just happens to be that she'll only eat Cesar's added to her renal diet.  We are truly grateful there is something she will eat.",5
"Took several weeks for my cat to get use to this, but she loves it now.  Just have to fill it up more often then I thought I would have had to.",4
"I have never heard of puppy pads before as I am not a dog owner. The vet tech told me about them because one of my cats is getting older and incontinent. When I pulled the pad out of the box I was extremely skeptical because unfolded, it is only about as thick as a paper towel. But it soaks up all the urine like it never happened. The surface underneath doesn't even get wet. Even though I have seen it I can still barely believe it. The cat loves them, I just place some around her normally sleeping area and she uses them when she can't make it to the litter. Cleanup is now as easy as 2-seconds of changing the pad. This is a life changer. 100% recommend.",5
This was nice to receive ID perfect as described as ordered.,5
"My dog, while not a fan of rawhides in general, exhibited the same opinion of these.  She tried to chew on them a bit, but quickly gave up, even though she did take note of the tasty center.  When I removed the rolled outer covering, she devoured the center.  I tried a second one the next night to see if she'd work at it in an attempt to get to the center.  She might have tried a bit harder, but gave up on trying to chew on the outer covering.  Again, once it was removed, another devouring of the center.

For dogs who like to chew on rawhides, either with a bonus treat in the middle or not, this might be an ideal product.  Since mine didn't like the outer covering, which could have been just her general distaste of them or something specific to this product, I can only give the product a slight above average rating.",3
Makes it easy to clean your critters cage. Just take the tray out and put a new one in. The trays come individually wrapped with bedding in them.,5
Great - no more spills,5
My dog asked me to say that he loves these and he's glad the box is so large.,4
"It is a beautiful sweater and would look so good on my pup.  He has a very short sleek coat so I thought I'd get it for him for going out in the cold this Christmas.  However, it doesn't fit.  He is a Pit mix and has a large chest so I got the XLarge size which, according to the description should have fit his 60 lbs.  The arm holes are plenty generous, but I could only get one paw through the opening.  The band on the underside of  the girth is not flexible. You'd think it would be stretchy being a sweater but it is the only part of the item that isn't.  I did check with Amazon to see if it came in XXL and it does not.  I'm going to check with my neighbor to see if it fits her pup who is a tad smaller.  If so, I'll give it to her.  If not, I'll have to return it.  I'm sooo disappointed...sigh.",5
"Great dog food,no fitlers or by products. Read the label on most dog food and they have fillers such as corn, rice etc and the protein % just is not good enough. After learning about all the top name dog food a few years back YOU JUST CAN'T TRUST THEM ANY MORE We switched to this and the Vet even says how great it is and she sells Science Diet

Can't beat the price ,shipped right to the door no tax no shipping cost no going five miles to pick up crappy dog food that is garbage",5
"I purchased Frontline Plus after I noticed a small outbreak of fleas on my cat. I've used two treatments on her now and the fleas seem to be multiplying after each treatment, rather than getting better. And worse, she comes down with a cold each time I give this crap to her. To be frank, this stuff simply doesn't work. If you look through the reviews, you'll see a lot of other people saying the same thing. They're not lying. It did work at one point. My cat came down with fleas a few years back (in 2008) and it worked great after just one treatment. But you can't trust this brand anymore. It's junk. Call your vet and get a proven flea medicine. This stuff is not worth the price, or the danger and the hassle.",1
"Great quality, price and shipping!",5
i thought I would get my cat another flavor to try of these and he said THE CHICKEN ONE IS BETTER......,3
Very tasty and great nutrition for my pup!,5
Great product,4
as well described and good deal for the money works great on my two dogs and would definitely recommend them I had lost the pen on one of the collars and it contacted the company to purchase another one they were a great they sent me new pins at no charge I  was very happy with this item,5
"Free-pouring kibble is a sure route to obesity.  Many pets are like humans and will eat everything set before them, so it is very important to measure each serving.

This food has generally wholesome ingredients and is especially high in fiber from grains and cellulose.  It is lower in calories than regular kibble and is nutritionally complete.

Chicken, chicken meal, and chicken fat give it an appealing flavor.

The kibble is smaller than usual, so it is well-suited for small breeds.",5
"edges were a little sharp. quickly sanded it down. didn't change the aesthetics after sanding down a bit. too big for 3 gallon tank, in my opinion. betta enjoys it.",4
The crickets for my daughters bearded dragon love this stuff. It keeps them alive much longer than without using it. That saves me money. Will buy again.,5
"Used these for a Star Wars theme cupcake order, they worked just fine for baking and the kids loved the liners and cute BB8 toppers!",5
Came just as I ordered.  Looks nice. And the price was way cheaper than going to a place like Petsmart.  Very happy with purchase.,5
Color and design are very fun and Kitty loves it. It's a win-win.,5
Arrived quickly.  Great price and the Koi love it!,5
"Awesome price and we buy this size because you get more for the money and my dog can eat the next size up just as fast, so I don't see the point in getting less for my money.",5
"Received very quickly.  I have been using this brand for quite a while, I have no problems with ticks, fleas, or mosquitos on my dog.",5
My dog destroyed this within a week,3
"The size chart is real accurate, and I love how it fits. Has velcro and a clip. Double ring so there is no way they can get out of it..........Best of all harness`es.",5
"Very cute & easy to use.
I probably should've waited until the 36"" came into stock, but we can make due with a smaller crate.

Recommend.",5
I really like to show my bettas in this tanks. It is really sturdy and looks really nice. The only problem is that there is still a gap on the sides of the divider and some of my fish can actually move from one side to the other. Other than that is a good product.,5
Great to use instead of foil !!!,5
Cats love it!,5
my grand pups love Zukes and it dosen't upset their stomachs,5
"My dogs seem to really love all of zekes products! They are both very picky (llasa schtzu mixed), but they love these treats.",5
"A relative has a cat and a little dog that love to lounge on the sofa, a chair and/or the bed.  Both had trouble jumping up as the years have rolled by.  I looked at many pet stairs that were offered in pet stores, catalogs and on line.  Most were too big, too small, too bulky, too heavy and too pricey.  Finally found these Solvit PupSTEP stairs and they are great!  They are light, they fold, have treads and side gards on the steps to avoid slipping and the price is terrific.  After several months of happy use in the living room, bought another one for the bed room.  Definitely recommend them.",5
"My pup really does not like getting a bath. We have a good-sized walk-in shower that the previous owner had built for her father who had Parkinson's, so there's a spray hose and everything. Perfect for bathing the dog. But with her pushing toward the door to get away, it's very difficult to bathe her with one hand and hold her with the other. These tethers really do help. They do come off the wall quite a bit, though (we have porcelain tile in there). At least she gives up for a while when they are sticking, so it makes it a little easier.",4
"The dogs took to these really well. They were perfectly sized for the 10 - 15 pound dogs, but seemed a bit too big for the little 5-pound Chihuahua. She was able to eat one, but it seemed a bit unruly and I was afraid to give her any more.",4
"Yuck! I am going back to Vetraseb. This stuff had a bad scent and shot out of the bottle way too fast. I rub the soap in small areas such as each foot and in between toes, so some control in dispensing this would have been nice.  I read answers saying there was no odor which baffles me because it has a cheap perfume smell in my opinion. I know this shampoo has a strong following but I personally feel there are better ones out there.",2
"I bought three of these collars for two dogs.  We have black dogs...you can't see them when they go outside at night!!  When we go camping, they just disappear!  So the collars are wonderful!  The dogs don't mind them at all and they show up so well.  I might use one for my bicycle when we leave early in the morning.

Very nice quality and they got here really fast.",5
"I LOVE it for my golden retriever! I brush her with this a couple times a week- OUTSIDE, because it gets off a TON of hair! It's made a real difference on how much shed hair I find inside the house! Very pleased!",5
Adorable!,5
God's gift to mankind. Best scoop EVER!,5
This was a fast and prompt delivery as promised and such an easy way to purchase the fiber capsules that our cat needs to stay healthy.,5
"Been feeding my 5 dogs ranging from chihuahua to great pyranees for a few months.  The great pyranees is the only one who has soft stool.  My other dogs are doing great on this food, including my 17 year old lab that is very sensitive to other foods I have tried.  All in all am pleased with this food.",4
"Harshly overpriced here, MSRP is $199.99.

So far so good though it did take a while to train the dogs to use it without our help.

Con:
I wish it could use alternative ball options like the GoDogGo versions do as tennis balls are NOT as safe as most people assume for larger breeds.

Random time setting would be a huge plus, small delay of a few minutes for rest breaks in TX heat.",3
"Absolutely the best cable tie for pets I have ever purchased.

My dog is crazy. A spunky little terrier with a lot of get up and go. This kept up with her. She never unearthed it. And it retracted when it should have. It has never broke.

The only issue is if you have patio furniture or something. My dog got the cable stuck around that a time or too. Pulled hard and the cable got wedged in there by her.

But seriously? This is a great quality product.",5
I have a MiKi puppy and she really loves this food.  The ingredient list looks healthier than most puppy foods and our breeder highly recommended it.  The size of the food in the x-small puppy bag is perfect for smaller/toy breeds.  I will buy the Royal Canin until she is outside the age/weight chart for this puppy food.,5
"I have never had a problem with fleas in my house--we never even use topical flea preventatives but when I brought a foster puppy home from a local shelter, he brought fleas with him.  Although he'd been given a flea bath and a topical pesticide, his ""super fleas"" somehow survived and ultimately spread to all of my animals (3 cats and 3 dogs).  I had to use a topical pesticide to stop the bugs in their tracks on all the animals to triage the situation.  Once we had the initial fleas dealt with, i wanted to find a SAFE alternative to pesticide based topicals.

A friend's vet uses and suggest these collars and my friends had nothing but good things to say about the collars, so I figured I'd give it a go.  I was worried about the essential oils and my cats, but after contacting the company (and getting a fast response), they said they had no reports of problems with cats who live with dogs that wear the collars.

I gave the collars a go and so far so good.  My foster puppy went back to the shelter to get neutered and came back AGAIN with fleas--this time they did not spread to the other animals, which was good!

If someone asked if the collars worked, I would, at this point say:  ""So far, so good""  it's fall/winter with snow on the ground--so not the prime time for bugs and my foster puppy hasn't gone back to the shelter to bring back fresh bugs..

I will say that I followed the guidelines on the manufacturer's website about taking the collars out of the packages and letting them sit OUTSIDE for 24 hours and they were STILL very smelly the next day.  It's not a BAD/YUCKY smell, but just a very very strong odor.  Now that the dogs have been wearing the collars for over a month, they actually smell nice.  I would really recommend making sure you let the collars sit out of the packages outside for 24 hours before putting them on the dogs.  I also followed the recommendations on the manufacturer's website that said to gradually get the dogs wearing them to make there there were no reactions to the collars--1hr the first day, 4hrs the second, 8hrs the third and after that I just left them on the dogs.",4
cannot get cat out of it,5
Strong chemical odor,4
Fast shipping! I rotate with this when feeding my axolotls. They absolutely love it! Lasts about 2 to 3 months across 4 axolotls.,5
"Frankly all dryers are noisy. This one is nice but wished it had a little heat.  Using it in my air conditioned house just blows cold air on her and it's uncomfortable but it straighten the hair.  My maltese prefer the human hair dryer because I can put it on low heat.
This was too expensive for and I would not buy it again.",2
perfect,5
Bought these for my daughters dog Cleo. She really loved them!,5
AAA,5
Dog loves it and the cover doesn't shrink when washed that within itself is great.,5
"The product itself is as described and works great. Now, I just have to train my dog using it.",4
No I just don't like it.,2
"I was surprised by how greasy this is. Even after being out in the snow for an hour, when my dogs come back inside, the floors get covered in the product. Because the product is greasy, my floors get very slippery.",3
My cats easily adapted to eating this new food and they are loving it! They are picky eaters but I never worry that they will turn up their noses at this food.,4
great for the Kong,5
delivered on time and as described,5
Well. My cat wouldnt touch them so I handed them off to a friend who has three cats. Her cats won't touch them so she handed them off to a friend who has two cats. Her cats won't eat them either. So now I know of 6 cats who refuse to eat these. Im disappointed.,1
"Arrived earlier than planned. My dog absolutely loves it! He's an 80lb hound and carries it with him everywhere! Great price, great toy! Super durable like all of the KONG toys so holds up well to even my destructive dogs!",5
My puppy loves this toy!! Best price anywhere! Great for teething and easy to wash. Kong toys are just awesome!,5
"These are my dog's favorite snack.  He reminds me daily if I don't give it to him first.  His vet said he has beautiful teeth (he's 4 years old) which makes me very happy, because dental health in a dog is a big deal and shouldn't be neglected.  The DentaStix do all the work for me.",5
WORK FANTASTICALLY!! I actually place mine under my Tidy Cats Cat Litter Pan that leaks...and this has been a GOD send!!,5
"So, I never even got to try this out because the top piece would not sit in the correct place.  Yes, the filter housing was in the right place.  I moved it multiple times in the smallest amounts to see if I had not placed it correctly.  Then every time I tried to force the top into place, the top of the filter housing popped right off.  Of course, when I WANTED to take it off, it required considerable force.  I have no idea if I got a defective one or what, but it took everything I had not to throw the POS across the room just to watch it shatter.  I know how to build things and put things together, so this wasn't some novice attempt at assembling something.  It simply did not fit the way it is supposed to.  Very frustrating and disappointing because I did TONS of searching online, and this was the best (seemingly) one.  Back to the drawing board or my cat is just going to have to learn how to drink out of his bowl, and I will have to live with him drinking out of the sink while I try to brush my teeth.  Hopefully, he learns to dodge spit.",1

He was gulping about three cups of food in a minute or so (ever so slightly slower when we added some tennis balls to the original dish we had been using) - but with this feeder it takes him several minutes. I have read reviews that indicate it did not extend the feeding time as long as might be desired. I can understand that, and, all dogs are different - but tripling or quadrupling the time to eat a large quantity of food is still a huge benefit if you look at it that way, rather than how many minutes that translates into. I paid less then $12 for this and it is definitely worth that small investment. I'm considering getting another one in one of the different designs just to change it up a bit for the dog.",5
Very fluffy at first but flattens out as the dogs lay on it. Good value for the price.,4
"Problems: no instructions, does not fit with curvy trim, latch mechanism difficult to adjust and easy for large kids/dogs to overpower.

I was very optimistic when I ordered this and thought it would be a cinch to install... I was wrong. Despite the design seeming simple enough, it takes a lot of fiddling to get it right. After an hour of tightening, loosening and re-tightening the pressure knobs, I still cannot seem to line up the latch perfectly. I ended up leaving it as it was (I have to push down on the gate as it shuts in order to latch the retractable latch). It probably would have been easier just to get out the power drill and install a more permanent type of gate with a more sensible latch.

After seeing the design and testing the gate, I would not recommend this gate for dog owners - or for toddlers for that matter. Even a small or medium sized dog with any sort of determination could bump open this gate.",2
Perfect for training and running/walking handsfree is wonderful,5
"I love this cage. I bought it for my lovebird and she slides up and down the bars and jumps around having fun. She can't get her head through the bars but sometimes she slips on the bottom. but still, she loves all the space in the cage. Not sturdy for a big bird, but I recommend for a smaller bird.",4
I bought this heater for my 2.5g betta tank. I had to turn it down almost all the way to keep that tank at 78*F. It maintains the temperature really well. When I got a 10g tank I put this heater on that tank and it works pretty will for that tank as well. A very versitle heater. Next time I need a heater I will be buying this brand.,5
"Sturdy cat cave! My cat loves it, though he fits better inside it without the thick, slightly too small cushion.  I had to add a cloth to replace the cushion because the bed floor is super thin, and it begs to be shredded if left unprotected.",5
I have a six month pup that is about 35 pounds and chews EVERYTHING!  Totally demolishes whatever she can get her hands on!  I'm hoping this helps satisfy her chewing needs without being destroyed. It looks great and is exactly what I was wanting so fingers are crossed! :-),4
"Got this for my dog who has bad knee
3 week with 2 of them per day 1 doing AM 1 doing PM, she is running and jumping ok!
I am very happy

Wow i paid $15 for a bag a year ago now is $22?",1
Love this product!! Have bought two in the last year for friends who's dogs have pulling problems and these have stopped the problems immediately. The best harness on the market!!,5
"dogs love these and they keep them occupied for long periods of time, very digestible in case they swallow a chunk.",4
"This works pretty well and was recommended by our friend's dog trainer.  It doesn't adjust to exactly the fit I need and the smaller size would have been too small.  It still works and he does pull significantly less with the leash clipped to the front.  The harness is well constructed.

Update: I recently purchased this item in a large as our dog had outgrown the medium.  This doesn't completely solve the pulling problem, but it is vast improvement and better than anything else I've tried.  The ability to clip the leash to the front is still the key to this working for us.  If I clip only to the back of the harness he pulls like a maniac.  I still have an issue with how this fits across the front of his chest, but other than that it is great.  Overall, this is a good option especially for dogs with short muzzles where other no-pull options aren't a feasible solution.",5
Best for the price. When pouring into the cat pan there is barely any dust that comes up. One bag can definitely last at least two weeks. We have two cats. After using the crystal cat litter I will never go back to a clay one. This one doesnt track all over like a clay litter. It lasts longer and holds in oder better than any other litter we have used.,5
My dog loves them. Keeps her busy for hours. 58lb. Very strong chewer.,5
Great!  I had one a long time ago and couldn't find a place to buy one.  It works!,5
"My dog has no interest in these.  He smelled them, tried chewing them and then whined.  I don't like the way they break apart if a larger dogs bites on them.",1
"This thing is amazing!  My cats have demolished the scratching post twine at the bottom, however, they still sleep on it daily.  We've had this about a year or so, with FIVE cats, and you can tell it's being used, but it's still sturdy!",5
"Great price, High quality product. Quick delivery.",5
One cat will attack this like they are ALIVE!! Mwuahaha!,4
My little puppy likes to take ME for a walk.  I was worried about her neck and throat in the harness she had.  No worries since getting this Gooby.  Fits well and doesn't impede her mobility.  She's only 8 pounds and wears a medium so judge size accordingly.,5
Thank you so much this is my favorite cat litter,5
I've only used it on one walk so far but I love it. I will probably buy another.,5
thank you,5
"This unit was described as posted and delivered on time. It makes a excellent addition to my aquarium, and fish have moved in.",5
My cats will eat this only if I mix it in with food that has a broth.  No bad smell .,4
GOOD PRICE FAST DELIVERY,5
"I left a comment for this product last year, and now we have a couple of new kitties. I ordered some more of these, and the new kittens love it as much as our ""old"" ones!  I love that this comes with a sticky thing that allows you to stick it to the wall or wherever.  I always keep several of these on hand, the cats go nuts for them.  Little pieces of cardboard twisted at the end of wires...  why didn't I think of this?",5
"I had originally bought this case for my 5 indoor only male cats because of stomach sensitivities but now am sticking to canned because of bladder issues with one of my male cats. One of my male cats has chronic bladder infections and instead of going on 'special food' or antibiotics every round of infection I've opted to feed only canned cat food with a very small bowl of dry kibble available throughout the day.
This canned food has extra gravy which I do like because it keeps the food from being dry and adds the extra moisture male cats need (cats are naturally dehydrated as in the wild they get water from live prey).
When I open a can it smells very good, gourmet actually and my boys although not overly excited about some flavors will eat their food. This has not caused any stomach upset in my boys and the one with bladder issues has not had any more problems since switching to canned only food.
I offer this food along with another brand to switch up the flavors and brands as my cats prefer the other brand but I prefer this one because of the superior quality and nutrients.",4
My persian cat refused to eat this.,1
"I purchased this to attach to a shock absorbing leash. I would have preferred to get a leash that is a little bit thicker, but that was my fault for not  making sure I picked the correct measurement. The colors and patterns are great, it really works well as an extension for the shock absorbing leash. It also works to have a good short leash when I need to use the short leash with my dog.",4
Softness of chews vary from bag to bag. Some are super soft and chewy. Others are hard as rocks and needs scissors to cut into pieces.,3
"This treat has a stinky smell but I don't care cause my cat loves it.  This cat  needs to take pills 2x's a day and I crack the pill into very tiny pieces and then bury it in 1/2  of the treat, then form it into a ball. I have no problem with the cat getting the pill down. I have tried other treats and the cat would find the pill and spit it out, every time. I just do this same thing until all pills have been chomped down which is a total of 2 treats morning and one at night.  Sure beats a pill popper!! etc. etc..",5
"do not fit the feeders they say, fit. good idea though",1
"I will be honest and say that when I first got this ball, it took me about 15 minutes, followed with some consulting with my husband to figure out how to open this thing. I kept trying to separate it in the middle, instead of just twisting the small handle on the top. So please note that is actually quite easy to open... if you know how to.

Now that I know how to open this, I love using it with my two cats. I don't feed them dry food exclusively, but I do give them about a 1/2 cup a day. This ball allowed me to slow down how long it took them to eat the dry food, preventing them from scarfing it down and soon vomiting it up. First they would kind of take turns using the one ball, and so I eventually bought them a second ball. Now I fill them both up about a third of the way full, then roll each ball in a different direction to get the kitties started (otherwise the smarties both go for the same ball).

I have the green and the blue colored balls. I recommend the green one because it is more easy to see through and figure out how full it is. However, note that the prices on these change nearly everyday, so just keep an eye on the price of the color you want.",5

"<div id=""video-block-R4I72TUXYNWUJ"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1MRC7BapVS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61E0FVn-mTS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;I ordered this for my furbabies so that they could watch the birds while relaxing at the window.  They already do that on my ""fur""niture but I wanted this for a window that they like to look out of that has nothing but a small ledge.

This unit came with no directions.  I looked through everything but there were none.  I couldn't figure out how to put it together by just looking at it so I found the listing on Amazon and looked through their photos.  It was very simple after doing that but I wish the company would have included the directions.

Once set up one of my furbabies that always has to try everything out first came to examine it.  For reference he weighs about 8 1/2 pounds.  I am including a video of his first experience with it.  You can see from the video at first he was more interested in the wires than anything.  He is my little mini blind licker through and through.

One more note on putting it together.  Be very careful that you attach the suction cups very well to the window.  I didn't have one of them attached well enough at first and one corner of it fell with my Teddy Bear.  To secure the suction cups you twist a knob around until it feels pretty tight.

Overall my kitties love sitting on this and looking out the window.  It hasn't stopped them from sitting on my furniture which I knew but it makes them happy nonetheless.  I am taking off one star because, in my opinion, there should have been directions in the box.

"My pitbull absolutely loves these.  With dental disease being way too common in dogs, we have tried many products to keep our fur kiddos' gums healthy.  This is our dogs favorite. She thinks they are the greatest thing invented and know the word whimzee now!  They don't stink and don't stain the carpet. You just have to make sure your dog chews them thoroughly for GI tract safety. The only downside I see is that they're pretty expensive when they only last her 5 minutes.",4
"Marlon enjoys his Sheba Cuts. He is 17 years old and has dry food available 24/7 and eats three wet meals a day: pate for breakfast and lunch, and he gets his Cuts for his dinner -- it works out well, since nighttime is when he is most alert and active and this food is more ""work"" for him to eat and the meal is more ""interactive!""  I switched to Sheba fairly recently from a more commercial brand and I feel really good about the transition: both because of what I see as better quality and Marlon's enthusiasm. Marlon has irritable bowel and he is sensitive -- the transition to Sheba was very easy for him. I am happy with Sheba and confident that Marlon (and I) will stay with Sheba for the rest of Marlon's life. Thank you, Sheba, for high-quality food. Thank you, Amazon, for giving me the ability to buy in bulk at such nice prices with free shipping. Thank you, Amazon Smile, for allowing me to support a fabulous charity that rescues cats. Talk about win-win!!!!!!!",5
Really wasn't sure if my cat was going to like this... she's pretty.... umm... boring. hahaha But she will randomly attack the ball and pounce and roll around on it. I'm satisfied. :),5
"At first, Harley loved these because he thought he was getting the peanut butter ones I usually gave his Salmon oil in. But he wised up, and so did I: the Duck & Pea formula is ghastly.  The smell is so bad and lingered on my fingers (blech!) so I started using a hospital glove to make it into a ball after I stick the capsule in.  I'm changing my selection to another flavor.",2
size was off didn't fit to great,1
"I can't tell you how much money we have spent shopping for that ""tough toy"". As a matter of fact I'm trying to get another chew toy equally as strong as this green hulky ball, princess needs more options!!! This green hulk of a ball is amazing!!I have had it for at least 6+ months and surprisingly it still LIVES! This is the real deal people, if you have a lean mean chewing machine, then look NO further! THIS IS IT! I had to cut one of the ends so that I could slip bigger treats into it (which is suggested on its label).  Oh yeah, you are wondering about Kong toys, she destroyed two already, to be fair they lasted maybe 2 months. which one you ask?, I purchased the large red one, somehow she managed to tear the top. I'm looking to get her a ""Tux"" chew toy. I gather those are tough as well. I will keep you guys posted on that one and let's see how that one handles the jaws on this crazy 2 year old rescue pit bull/boxer mix. FYI: In my opinion, this toy is not intended for small dogs,ie under 35lbs.",5
"My parents' little dog comes to visit us sometimes, so we decided to see how he likes these treats. He gets little treats regularly from my parents, but apparently none he likes so well as these. He goes crazy for these treats!

They're small and soft, so perfect for tiny breeds. Of course, they're also great for larger breeds during training.",5
This didn't seem to work for me. Neem worked better.,1
Addictive song!,5
"My two little dogs love the patties.  This is full of nutrition, and easy to serve. Nice to always have them available without spoiling.
I am not wanting to deal with fresh raw food - this is perfect. I will be sure to have a bag and not run out. Great invention.",5
Have 3 cats and this is perfect for dry food on bottom and small cans on top.,5
"This harness is not as pictured.  It does not have two clasps near the chest, nor does it have a ring for a leash near the chest straps.  Instead, from the neck straps there is a a short strap with a ring that would be used to attach to a leash (or seatbelt).  I believe this is a horrible design.  Instead of the harness spreading the force from a pull (or an accident) across the entire harness, all of the stress is on the straps near the neck--not on the neck itself, but on the upper portion of the harness nearest the neck which I still believe defeats the purpose of a harness. And it's ill-fitting. I ordered a XS-S for my slightly overweight 21 lb poodle mix, and while the chest fits fine, the front straps were very loose at the tightest setting.  I believe there are many better harnesses available.",1
"Sharp and easy!! These work SO much better than the kind that clip from the sides, especially for dogs with thick nails, no crying and screaming like we're murdering them anymore YAY!!! Best investment in a while!",5
"Our three pups love, love, LOVE goDog brand toys. We normally buy the Large size because our biggest guy is 70lbs. This time I went with the small and our two 35lb mini Aussies play keep away with this thing for hours. I was really worried that the smaller size meant that it would get destroyed faster, but it is actually holding up better.. I am guessing that since it is too small for the dogs to play tug of war that even though it gets more play time, it is taking less damage than the larger version.

I absolutely recommend these toys. They last about a month in our house before they are ready to be retired, much longer than similar toys from other brands. They also keep our dog's interest no matter what other toys they have out. Definitely worth the money.",5
 PERFECT ,5
These bully sticks are wonderful and my puppy loves them but OMG do they create a mess! After some chewing there is some mushy sticky stuff that create mess. It is easy to clean if it is on a hard floor but what to do with rugs and carpet. I love my English bulldog puppy very-very much but I can't stand the mess and smell after bully stick was chewed for some time. It has nothing to do with this particular brand of bully sticks as I tried few and the result is the same - stinky mess.,4
"We have an 80# Staffordshire mix dog with a 33 1/2"" girth, who is very strong. So pleased when the XL harmess arrived so quickly, and pleasantly surprised it was so well made of high quality materials. I have found other harnesses to be flimsy for big strong dogs. The straps are easy to adjust and the writing is easy to read. Great Product, thank you!!",5
"Decent crate but alignment is wonky and latches are hard to open/close. But you get what you pay for, and I like it enough to order a second one for upstairs.",3
"Although my dogs ripped the back seam apart and tore out the minimal stuffing within a few weeks, this lasted a lot longer than any other stuffed animal I have purchased for them (I'm a sucker, because my female dog loves having a ""baby"" to carry around).  I have 2 German Shepherds.  About 6 weeks after purchasing, at least 1 squeaker still works and the rest of the toy is intact, besides the ripped back seam. The dogs still love it and play with it, hence the 4 stars. Most other stuffed animals survived less than 2 days.",4
They work,5
Thanks!,5
Won't run out of this for a long time!,5
my dog loves it!,5
Great product,5
My dogs absolutely love this rope. I wish the handle wasn't made of such hard plastic though. Its very hard to avoid hitting one on accident when you have multiple dogs. Product is very durable and well worth the money.,4
Regret buying these for my dogs. Really don't work for them. They are pretty obnoxious in my truck and hoped this would help. Not really,3
Challenging to put together.,4
"The Purina Tidy Cats Breeze is the best system I have used for my cats. I also paired it with the litter Genie Plus litter disposal system and in my opinion, it's a win, win combination. I like the pellets because I believe they keep odor controlled from their urine and their poo. That said, I purchased a home with solid wood floors. Both clumping clay and crystal litters would fall in the floor joints and were extremely hard to clean out.
The pellets occasionally make it out of their bedroom, but they are easily spotted and picked up. I replace the pad bi-weekly for my two cats.
I believe The Genie Plus is worth mentioning using along with the BREEZE. I keep them close enough together to facilitate cleaning their poo.
If all sides were the same height as the back I would call the BREEZE perfect but then, that would require another star!",5
"Scottie's attention was fully focused on this toy as I unwrapped it.  I took it outside where husband was sitting and said, ""I give it less than 20 seconds"", then tossed it over to Scottie.  Within the allotted timeframe, the duck's hard quacking mechanism was broken and duck's tail was next on his list.  Like another reviewer, it was fun to watch the sheer 20 seconds of joy but the toy does not stand up to my dog.  As a caution, the toy is much smaller than I expected and could be swallowed and cause a choking hazard for any but the smallest of dogs.
I've purchased other toys by this manufacturer and they have been winners.  Unfortunately, this toy would do best with a small, gentle dog rather than a rough-and-tumble Scottish Terrier!",2
"Keeps my dog nice and warm for winter romps and doesn't shift.  Wish it was made of a more durable fabric as my dog likes to run in the woods so has some small tears in it.  After looking at several other products though, I would still recommend this one.",5
"Bigger than others of the same make and size, especially the Martingale loop with the D ring.",3
"Absolutely the best brush ever for our long-haired cat. She loves to be brushed with the de-matting comb, which means no more coughed up fur balls. Thumbs up for this tool. Oh, works great on our German Shepherd too!",5
wildly inconsistent. 1st six packs were great just like normal. Just opened 2 more packs and these seem dry and flaky like cake with too much flour. Really hard to close them on the pill. Almost like rubber. Not expired either. May call the company.,1
"Works on our French Bulldog puppy! I pet and stroke him with one hand, while brushing with the other, alternating hands so he doesnt seem to notice the furminator!",5
I was a little nervous when I put it up to see if it would stay once my cat sat on it but everything worked out and it is very sturdy I didn't switch the padding so the back is not on the window,5
Kitty likes variety too.,5

My toy poodles had issues with chewing their paws so I decided to try a Grain-Free dog food.  They love this one and don't eat as much of it as their old Purina/store brands I used to buy.  I can attribute that to this higher quality with less fillers I am sure.  They stopped chewing their paws after 2 weeks of being on this food exclusively. I have a 4 lb toy poodle who is 13 years old and she's been doing great with the size of the morsel.  She stopped chewing her paws also (prob due to grain allergy).,5
Excellent product. I only buy this way now for almost everything!,5
"I don't even have dogs, but I got this to protect my back seat from getting dirty. It works great. Dirt, crumbs, and other debris don't get on the seat. I wish I could buy small ones for the front seats!",5
great food great price,5
Bought this for our 1yo Lab. Our 15yo has some joint issues so we're starting our youngster out early for prevention of possible problems. He thinks of it as an extra treat so it must taste good! Feed our 60lb. boy 4/day.,5
"my dog likes these, but not as much as other treats",4
These are expensive and basically a waste of money. They don't work as claimed in any way shape or form. Much too pricey for what you get. Dog gobbles them down so there is less than a minute in the mouth to do any 'enzymatic' work,2
this product worked as describe for a nitrite problem I was having with my 5 year old tank.  I lost a few fish before using this product and months later the problem is still solved and no more stock has perished.,5
"These are great nail clippers and very sharp.  Mind you so far I have just trimmed one tiny little piece off of one nail of his Royal Majesty the Westie in residence since we are doing it the whole - let's not upset ""Mr. Don't Touch My Nails!"".  Prior to this his only nail trimmings have been at the vets and not only is that expensive, we don't go enough so he is now the dog equivalent of Howard Hughes with these long uncomfortable and undignified nails.

Thus we are 'taking our time' and hopefully before the end of the year comes I will have at least done the nails on his back feet.  I hope to convince him with the judicious use of Salmon Jerky rewards that having a pedicure is not the end of the world.  Wish me luck.  Even with that tiny little trim he gave me a disturbed panicked look and began the whole ""you're not the boss of me"" shenanigans.

Thankfully these are very high quality and let me make little bitty snips without putting pressure on his Majesty's nails.  I am also glad they came with a file which will help keep those slightly trimmed nails from ending up as tiny little dog shivs.  So we are on our way and who knows, perhaps 2015 will have less clicky clacks from old gnarly nails on the wooden floors.",5
"I am very Pleased with this Stroller, I highly recommended it!!!! I bought this for my daughter who has a 16 week old mini dachshund and is disabled and I also have her sister who is not disabled and they both fit in the stroller right now and they just love it. My Daughter will need hers always for her puppy. I am also thinking about investing in one for our mini dachshund because I love to go on long walks and I know she gets tired and mini dachshunds don't walk a long distance. Alot of room for toys and blankets and great storage under for water and food.,",5
Needed extra sweaters for my Chihuahua+Jack Russell mix since his short fur isn't enough to keep him warm during cold nights in SF. When this sweater arrived I was surprised by the quality stictiching and material since its so affordable. Fits my dog like a glove and adds additional warmth. Whats really neat is the sweater makes sure the opening on the bottom is wide enough to allow my dog to excrete without getting teh sweater dirty.,5
"My umbrella cockatoo only attacks this when he is angry. While it's nice that he has something to vent on, it leaves color stains on his white feathers.",3
"Have used with my foster cats that previously were outdoor kitties.  Works great so far, as they learn it's the only way they get to go out.  Easy to put on and take off.  Just be careful on long hair kitties not to catch their fur between the Velcro straps.  This was the second one I have purchased as I sent the first one home with one of the fosters when he was adopted.",5
"It's pretty easy to get a 5 star review from me but this just didn't do it. First off, the one I received didn't work. At all. As in I plugged it in and nothing came out. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement. I understand that sometimes you just get a bad one, and was still willing to give good review. I received the new one and it worked when plugged in, so I hooked it all up in my tank. I bought the size that was recommended for my aquarium, and it is supposed to be able to power 4 separate stones, etc. according to the box. I hooked up 2 small stones, and a broken ship decoration that required 2 airlines. When I plugged it in I got 2 to work. If I pinch one then another one will come on, but once I let go only 2 continue. No matter what I do this thing only has the power to run 2 things. What a disappointment. My husband took apart the original broken one and managed to make it work (but the airflow cannot be adjusted) so now I have both of them running only 3 airlines in my 40 gallon tank. I'm very disappointed in this and I certainly won't buy this brand again.",1
Good product.,4
"It's beautiful.  Well made but our drawback is only one of our animals will use it.  So will probably end up going back to the 360.
My husband said it is a lot easier to clean tho.  We will keep working with them.  We are not giving up.",4
My fish loves his bubble wall. He spend hours hanging out in the spot were I have it attached. I love the suction cups they last a long time.,4

"Really great product for dogs with allergies and other sensitivities. It took me forever to find a dog food that my dog would take to well, given all her allergies.

"I have two dogs, a maltose and a havachon (Havanese/Bichon Frise) and they love these treats.  The maltese likes them broken into halves or quarters while the havachon prefers them whole.  These are made in China, however I have had no problems with these treats.  This is my second order.",5
My Aussiedoodle is addicted to these carrots! She loves them so much we make sure to have back ups in case one gets lost in the yard or finally gives up from being loved to pieces!,5
"These are well made, easy to put on and take off. They have extra padding in case of an accident. I used these for my female while in heat. They are easy to clean too.",5
Great toy.  Small and light weight enough for my small Maltipoo to run around with it in her mouth.  It is by far one of her favorite toys as well as a favorite of the other dogs in the park.,5
"We adopted two kittens, and will most likely be taking them to the vet at the same time whenever they need their annual shots. (Fingers crossed that they don't need to go more often than that.)  I took them both together in the same carrier that we used for our adult cat who recently died. I realized very quickly that when they're little and under 5 pounds each the single carrier will work fine, but would be impossible to use for both of them once they got bigger. I bought two of these pet carriers, and with the shoulder straps, I'll be able to carry one kitten on each side comfortably. The carriers are not large, but they'll be large enough for these two even once their full frown.",5
"Nice and bright LED strip for the aquarium! I just hooked up the timer module as well, which is great!",5
"This kitty food is a very high quality and my cats have never turned their noses up and refused to eat it. However, it has grain and meat by products and fillers. If you are the type of pet owner who doesn't want those things in a food, I recommend Blue Buffalo.",4
my dogs love this and I like it that it has real food in it,5
"My dog has multiple food allergies & is on rabbit/potato food.  I was excited to find this since it is only rabbit, no other ingredients.  It's hard to find treats he can have.  I needed a treat he would be crazy about to help with his training.  He LOVES these and responds very quickly to commands.  I love that they aren't smelly,  sticky and don't crumble.  I will be ordering more soon.  Highly recommended!",5
"I first borrowed one of these from a friend, and it worked so well, I had to get one for myself (actually my kitty).  I like how it gently encourages the kitty in the direction you are intending, but when that bad boy bolts, it holds on to him like a glove.  i've tried other harnesses/leashes, and had given up until I tried this one.  I thank you, and so does the cat.",5
I DONT LOVE IT MY CATS DO.i JUST LIKE IT BUT THATS JUST ME,5
"It was not EXACTLY what I was expecting. It's very shallow, and the 4 watt heater thing is not helpful in 20 degree weather. They recommend not using outdoors and we don't = we use it in a 14 X 14 garden shed that houses a few kitties. Not going to reorder",2
Delivered on time and product is as promised.,5
My dog absolutely loves these!  Very good price compared to retail stores.,5
"It does what it says it does and I like it, but the top section of the trigger handle takes 2 batteries and they continuously fall out. I had to duct tape it closed.",3
Great idea but my bird hates it and won't sit on it.,4
My cat loved Wellness Salmon dry food. He has a shiny coat with perfect weight. He ate this for two years but I was forced to switch to a prescription food because he has a rare urinary tract condition for young male cats.,5
"My cat loves these. I just take the sticks of processed chicken jerky, and break them into little half inch bites. For starters, it's so much better for my cat then giving him the cat treats that come in the little bags. Those are high in calories, and preservatives, plus have lots of grains. This jerky is made from meat, and not a lot of grain filler. If you were to buy ""premium"" cat treats in those little bags, you're spending a lot more money for quality cat treats, than getting a big bag of these dog treats, and breaking them up. Two little half inch pieces, are enough for my little buddy's snack attacks. So, from my cat's perspective, its a FIVE MEOW treat. Since there are no pictures of dogs on the packaging, my cat doesn't even know they're for dogs. In homes with interspecies pets, (a dog and cat), I would think you could cut down the jealousy factor, by giving your dog and cat the SAME treat, at the SAME time.

I was provided a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.",5
"My cats totally love this mouse, and after they somehow managed to tear off most of the tail, I tied it to our cat tree and they bat it around and have a blast.",5
"I was a bit skeptical of this thing when I saw the mixed reviews.  I was worried my cat would get bored with it quickly like some others have said.  However, my cat is in LOVE with this thing.  She comes running when she hears the whir of it and gets sad for a while when it turns itself off.  She has a blast chasing it every time and we get a kick out of watching her.  My husband also uses it to keep her amused when he is trying to clean and she gets in his way.  It is true that is not very random, but my cat still hasn't figured out the pattern well enough to be bored.  She doesn't care as long as she gets to chase that glorious red light and make her signature ""hunting"" noise.  Best cat toy I have ever purchased (excluding the floor to ceiling cat tree from Walmart).  Is definitely my cats favorite, just above twist ties.  We put it on the third shelf of a bookcase and it circles the whole floor of our living room from that height.",5
"My cat absolutely hates riding in the car in his carrier.  We had a 40-minute car ride coming up and I was dreading it. I ordered this seat at the very last minute hoping that it would make the ride more tolerable for the little guy and me.  And it did!  He took right to it and was so much calmer and happier for the ride.  Securing his harness to the seat was easy, and so was securing the seat with the seatbelt.  If you have a cat who hates car rides you should definitely give this a try.",5
Love it and the color is beautiful,5
"I really, really, really love this cat box!  Whoever thought of this should be really proud of themselves.  LOL!!  Some tips to note are to make sure you roll the box clockwise kinda slow, tap the bottom and roll it halfback counter clockwise.  Pull out the poopy drawer and dump in the trash.  The poopy drawer is very long and sturdy so don't worry about spilling anything.  Also, make sure not to overfill the box where it is super heavy because it will put stress on the seams and litter will seep out.  Every now and then you will have to retighten the clips that holds it together but that's only if you have totally overfilled the box with kitty litter.  It is not perfect, but it's close to it!!!",5
"And I like feeding it.  It is of high quality, smells good, digests well and easy to spoon out.  It is a regular feature on the doggie menu.",5
"Love this pink carrier for my girl yorkie, as described recomended",5
I've gone through one bottle and my dog has yet to turn away from her dog dish.,5
Would recommend these to every dog owner! Very good and easy to use.,5
Piper Basenji loves these and so do I. They are tasty AND small and perfectly suited to long games of  Find It which is really all we can play in the confines of our motor home house.,5
my dog loves them so hope it help with her skin issues,5
"I couldn't be happier with these dog cotts. I reccomend dog cotts for my growing german shepherd pups and adults.,the males tend to throw themselves on the floor and is at risk of developing water on the elbow among other problems. They are very well consructed and easy to assemble. Cant go wrong with this one.",5
Other dog foods with grain have given my dog allergies. My dog seems to really like Instinct and she doesn't get any bad reactions from it. As far as I can tell it is very nutritious and is reviewed well online. It is made in the USA and the price is good. I also like that they have matching wet food and treats so I can change it up and not worry about my dog getting an upset stomach.,5
Great for our Silkese puppy.  The size is perfect for a small dog or hard to get areas,5
"Works the same as Capstar but less expensive. I foster for a cat rescue so before my foster kittens and cats go to our shelter for adoption, I give them a tablet to make sure they are not bringing in any stray fleasbb",4
My turtle eats it and is a good price.,5
The dogs love them!,5
"Very nice quality leash - perhaps a bit too sturdy though.  I don't quite understand why the shorter 4' leash comes in the 1"" size instead of say 3/4 or 5/8"".  Also, the clip is quite large and heavy. I would have preferred a thinner leash with a smaller clip, as both our dogs are 30-35 lbs.  The options for 4' colored leashes were limited though, so this was what we ordered.  I like the shorter leash for hiking trails where there are a bunch of people (which I do often).  With a 6' leash I'm constantly pulling them back in by bundling up the leash in my hand.  I'm not keen on the retractable leash style for two dogs, and I prefer that my dogs stay close anyhow.",4
"This is one of two canned dog foods my ultra picky chihuahua never tires of.  Although not cheap, it is much less expensive than some of the canned foods of comparable quality.  Lots of meat, not just sauce or veggies.",5
Best box ever for multiple cat homes.,5
Great.,5
Our companions love these. Exactly what we wanted and fast delivery,5
My dog has allergies to just about everything but this food is great. He has enjoyed it and also his itchiness has cleared up quite a bit. It's nice to save money by ordering it from amazon instead of from a pet store.,5
"My cats all love these, but they're constantly falling apart. (The fish, not the cats.:) I've mended them so many times that there's no more fabric left to mend! I suggest buying the bananas or cigars instead.  Those hold up much better!",2
"I do not like the meat flavors of dog toothpaste out there. Chicken, beef, gravy?!? Yuck! This one is mint. It actually freshens my dog's breath while I clean his teeth. I apply a pea size dab on one of those nubby brushes you put on your finger. Then I brush my dogs teeth. He loves eating toothpaste, which I am assuming is safe to ingest in small quantities as my dog has never gotten sick from this. Sometime it takes up to 3 or 4 dabs to get to all his teeth because he likes eating it so much. So it all works out...for everyone. He'll sit there and let me brush his teeth while he's trying to eat the tooth paste. Fun times. No struggle at all.",5
Nice and cheap food. I only use this for my feeder minnows. Not sure about the long term nutrition of this.,4
"I don't know about you, but I'm always in need of storage and my garage suits my needs. These containers allow me to keep stored items in the garage safe from critters, water- and the prying eyes of my nosy redneck neighbor who loves to come be a looky-loo every time the garage door is up and I'm working out there. Not that I've got anything to hide- it's just aggravating.
Anyway, good price on the 6-pack and Prime's exceptional delivery (which would've been pricey because of the size).",4
"this is a sturdy, easy to assemble stroller that we use for our cat. the harness clips into the seat so we can open the hood and had no problems at all. enjoy!",5
My dogs love these chews.  Both of my doodles are soft chewers and they chews last them several days.  They will tire of them and then go to their toy box and retrieve them days later.,5
"I purchased the Wellness CORE canned for my highly allergic and dehydration-prone dog in order to try it out. I had reviewed the ingredients and liked that the first ingredients were fish (Salmon, Whitefish, Herring, Mackerel, Salmon Broth, Salmon Meal) and believed it to be a higher quality canned food than my dog's current canned food diet, which is Natural Balance L.I.D. Sweet Potato and Fish.

My dog loves any fish-based wet food, so she well eat either with gusto. Although there is nothing necessarily wrong with the Wellness CORE, I was not super impressed by the quality, smell or appearance. The Wellness CORE is grayish and appears thick (less moisture). This may be due to the types of fish used in their formula. By contrast, the Natural Balance has a lot more moisture, probably due to the use of fish broth as the first ingredient, and is orange in color, probably due to the amount of sweet potato in their formula. Considering that the Natural Balance also has fish for 4 out of 6 of the first six ingredients (Fish Broth, Ocean White Fish, Sweet Potatoes, Salmon, Potatoes, Salmon Meal), has more moisture, is made specifically for allergic dogs, and is $10 (30%) cheaper than the Wellness, I have decided to stick with Natural Balance.",3
We toss these in the pool and our german shepherd loves to retrieve them!!,5
This Stuff is great for in between cleanings,5
Went by the description but way to big for my beagle. Order smaller than the chart,2
"My three year old Boston Terrier LOVES this dog food.  She has lost weight, and her coat is nice & shiny.",5
"A year in and this thing still works great. The cat loves it and when hes on it, it warms up nice for a comfortable place for him to relax. When hes not in it, it cools down a bit to save electricity and to keep the bed just a little warm for his return. A+",5
"Pretty good, a bit small, but works to keep food from going on your carpet or other floors and making more of a mess.  Thinner than I would like,",4
"I filled it with water, in accordance with directions. Within a day or two, it had all these gross little flies coming out of it. Contaminated soil, I assume. Check other reviews, I'm not the only one who had this problem.

Don't know if cats like it because had to be thrown out. Very dissatisfied with this product.",1
"Super mat that kept our porch kitties warm throughout the cold winter we had here in Charlotte, NC. My sister-in-law has one for her cats up in northern Indiana...try one if you have any cold weather at all in your area.",5
Didn't really work that well for all my dogs. Just one of them. I have 4 dogs and it seemed to only work on my terrier/shepherd mix.,3
"Great for keeping seeds from flying everywhere. We have owned several of the vision cages and the pros outweigh the cons.
Pros: This model is perfect for our two conures. We purchased a second cage for their 'season time' so they could have their own space. Great for keeping seeds and such in the cage. The acrylic base allows for unobstructed views for the birds. Great bowl covers and feeding bowls. It took our birds a few days to get used to the feeders on the floor.
Cons: Not the easiest cage to clean. Lots of nooks and crannies on the base provides hiding places for sugar ants. (we have a serious problem in this region). A bit of a pain to assemble.
Our most recent one arrived with a broken base but was replaced within two days. Second one was damaged too. Not well packaged. Do NOT buy from Amazon.  After learning of the second broken cage they offered to waive the shipping fee and would allow me to PAY for another one at the same cost.",4
Losses power and sharpness quickly.,3
"After going through many different food brands, this is the only one my senior yorkie will eat daily and consistently. When I got my second dog, I started him on this and he loved it. I tried buying another food that was on sale for him and he barely ate it. If both my dogs like it and I'm satisfied with the quality, it's a winner.",4
"Was perfect for keep the litter box out of the way, it also helps keep the litter from being all over.  I wasn't worried about covering the box, so I left the door off, and it works great.",5
"Been great for our pup so far! Took them on a plane for vacation, easy to pop up along the way if our little guy was thirsty. Solid material, easy to wash, no design flaws that I have come across.",5
"Indestructible even for a 90 pound Staffordshire....love the old, despising the new. UPDATE:  Wouldn't recommend for Staffordshire dogs...apparently the toys just are not meant for BIG DOGS.  After 4 days of play, the top is entirely missing.  Very disappointed as KONG used to be really good.",5
Works well and is well made.,5
Have not used looks good,4
"Purchased more than one - this works GREAT!  Easy to use and lightweight, I keep one in my backpack at all times.",5
Small so not comfortable to hold but does the trick when I want to look through my dogs coat.,3
Dogs liked the taste. The consistency was liquidy not at all firm. made a MESS. Would not buy again.,3
No Comment,5
Perfect solution for a messy cat.,5
This product was well made and designed. It will come in handy on short or long rides with your pet.,5
"Very nice quality set of jingle bells.
Dog is still working out the process of using, but the product itself is very nice.",5
Nice puppy dog chew.,5
"This is not so much a product review as it is my story about my experience diagnosing my dog's urinary issue. (I'm sure it's a fine product, but it didn't - and couldn't -- work for us, read on). About a year ago, our 10 year-old French Bulldog started peeing in the house for the first time in years.  She is a spayed female and we had put her on Proin at around age 6 because she would pee in her sleep. It worked well up until recently.  The vet said it was probably a UTI and gave us some antibiotics.  2 weeks later, no better.  Urine tests and cultures came back clean.  The vet continued the antibiotics.  2 weeks later, no improvement.  Tried a different antibiotic, this time for a month.  No improvement.  The vet said it was probably behavioral and we should try increasing the Proin.  We did for a short time with no luck.  Went to 2 other vets.  Same story, same treatment.  It's been 3 months.  Now she would go in the house, but was having trouble when she wanted to go. She started to walk funny.  The vet thinks it might be something with her back or hip.  Prescribed pain Meds. No effect.  Another new vet. This one asked if she had had an ultrasound of her abdomen yet.  She hadn't, so we had one done.  A small tumor was found next to her urethra, restricting the flow of urine.  ""It's very common"" the vet said (apparently not common enough for 3 other vets to diagnose).  At this stage, there is little that can be done.  It's inoperable, and we're told it becomes metastatic in most cases..  We can try chemo or radiation, but they give a best case of adding a year or so...  A year filled with doctors visits and my pooch feeling sick.  We decided to try a drug called Peroxicam instead.  In 20-35% of cases it can sometimes halt or reverse tumor growth.  If peeing becomes more difficult for her, she will have to be put down before it becomes a total blockage, which would mean a painful death.  Hopefully this review will be helpful to someone who is struggling the same way we did.  Love them.  They love you unconditionally.",5
"I call these treats, little green cheerios, for bunnies. My rabbits really like these treats, just don't feed them to many or else they don't want to eat their food.",4
"Yorkie used to like them, but is refusing the last package I ordered.",3
All my rescue dogs went crazy over these- the smell is something else but they LOVED them !,5
Very durable toy. My dog loved it. There are two large tubular squeakers inside (not the smaller disc-shaped ones) and they stitching on the toy was done well. My dog rips all of his toys apart but this one took him awhile. I've re-sewn new squeakers into this twice and it's still in good shape.,4
I do alot of camping with my dogs.  This keeps them flea and tick free.  I could not live with out it.,5
"Purchased 2 of these for our 75lb dogs (lab/pit mix and husky/ GSD mix) The only issue is the water. Our Husky mix is a sloppy drinker and splashes all over. For this we have to clean the water out from under the bowls every time we change their water. It does help keep some of it from the floor, so that is a plus.",4
the cat loves the taste of the water when used with the foam filter on the pump this filter lasts a lot longer.,5
My guinea pig loves these! My vet advised to find something not filled with sugar so I really appreciate that the base is timothy grass and other grains. This works for both the advice I was given and the happy dance from my guinea pig!,5
Not popular with the dig I babysit.,3
So these used to be great but they changed the design.  They are now trapezoid (smaller on one side than the other) which makes them a real PITA to fit in our drinkwell (steel pan version). We have to really jam it in there to make it fit.  Not sure why they changed the shape of the filters.,2
"Dogs like them. They prefer bully sticks, but these are a close second.",4
Nice big can of flake food.  My fish swarm to the stuff.  I end up mixing it with dried blood worms and keeping a smaller can that I just refill from this one.  Great Stuff,5
I mix about 1/4 can of this classic Chicken and Rice entree in with the Purina Savor dry kibble and my dog loves this stuff but he won't touch any of the stuff 'in gravy'.  I'm not sure what's different but gobbles this down and left the other sitting in the bowl. He is a big active boy and is always ready to eat this but not the gravy.,5
"My dogs LOVE this. I got it for my 16 year old pom. It is very wet, so good for dogs that don't like chunks. My dog ate this after her surgery and did well. Got her to eat more!",5
"As noted by other reviews this collar is stiff as a board. The only reason I could use it is I did not need it immediately and I softened it some. The way it was packed, well, it was tied together in the middle, strange. I would not recommend this collar unless you have time to waste to get it ready for use.",3
I purchased three of these for my dogs when they ride in the car.  I am an overprotective dog Mom & always worried about what might happen if I was in an accident or if the doors were opened and they would get out unsupervised.  These safety harnesses have eased my mind about those issues.  They miss being free but now I have peace of mind.  They will adjust.,5
"These are nice little treats and my dog loves them.  Amazingly, so does my cat!  He gets in line whenever someone opens the treat jar.",5
"I have used this type before and they are great.  Easy to adjust, comfortable for the dog.  I purchased the large for my fox terrier who weighs 18lbs and it is just right for her.",5
"I have tried so many odor and stain removers and wanted to like this stain and odor remover since it is recommended by Jackson Galaxy, but it does not seem to deter the cats from urinating in the same place on the floor. After using this product several times I cannot smell the urine, but I guess the cats can.",3
"I saw this toy used on ""My Cat from Hell"" and I knew my cat would like the toy because he loves chasing toes and hands under covers. The only bad thing is, he is a rather large cat and sometimes sits on the toy while it is on and it makes a loud clicking noise and sounds like the motor might give out. On the upside though, the toy seems to recognize him there and moves the toy away which is really neat. Our new kitten (6 months) loves it too and will go into the other room and stalk it, then pounce. Good quality product for a great price.",5
Really cute bowls. Love them!,5
"i love this item , my pup just loves the tast , he follows after it after the droper is enpty,  he knows the box when he see's it, when we tell other people about this item, thank you so much for your time,",5
Fast shipping and great product!,5
"Very easy to get treats out when you need them quick.  Also easy to shut so you aren't dropping them all over the ground.  I had a clip on pouch with drawstring closure and it would fall off my waist when hit while training or bounce off while running agility course.  It was hard to close so I would leave it open then treats would spill when I bent down.
This works much better...never falls off and closes easily.  Washed it out easily as well.  Would highly recommend this item.  Wish I had this when I was training agility.",5
"There are much better ways to manage your dog such as the Gentle Leader and similar collar alternatives, and harnesses which take all the pressure off the neck.  Whether it's to address aggressive behavior or just unruliness, please find a solution for you and your pet that can do no harm!",1
"Simple seatbelt -- simple effective design, simple to adjust and use. My dog is now (safely and happily) confined to the back seat. I use this with a harness.",5
"I purchase a similar item in stores and loved it. The features on this leash I prefer is the thick gauge leash and completely reasonable price. The one I got in a store was substantially more expensive and ended up getting frayed/chewed over a three month period. This one seems like it holds up well to naughty puppies much better. The only thing it is missing is that the other leash had a metal part at the junction of the two ends that attach to the dogs to keep them from getting tangled as they criss cross. Not the end of the world, but with the thicker gauge you have to sort them out if it happens three times or so. The poop bag holder is also a big harder to attach because of the gauge. A traditional key chain ring doesn't really fit, mine came with a free one but it broke when I was trying to attach it. But for the price I can totally live with it.",3
Perfect for people how make their own pet toys. For christmas I make my pets a variety of toys for there stocking and this is great for that. I tested every squeaker when it came in and every single one works!,5
"I loved this bubbler when I first received it. It comes with everything you need to set up in your aquarium and the changing colors are great. My only complaint is that it gets dirty really fast and you have to scrub it with a brush to get the gunk off. So, in scrubbing the algae it actually takes some of the color (white) off too. It wouldn't be a big deal if I didn't have to clean it every 2 weeks and that is when it starts to look really bad. I definitely recommend the products just maybe one of the other ones instead.",3
"Quality is fine but it is realky, really small. My 6 lb terrier is squished in it.",2
"This is the second tree I've bought. I had one a couple years ago for another cat I had (before a coyote got her). She LOVED this thing and once I got it, I never had a problem with scratching my leather furniture. Maybe I just got luck, know knows but it worked for 2 cats at one point. Now we have a new one and I immediately knew I needed to get this again. Price is awesome too.",5
My 8 month old lab ate the balls and then proceeded to chew up the chuck it tosser.  She is very rough on toys.,3
"Absolutely essential suction cups with clip to keep air hoses or wires in place. They get slimy in water, but easily cleaned off. Never use detergent!!!",5
Very good and plenty of them. Awesome price.,5
"I have a furminator and this brush both. I like the furmintator better because it gets more hair off my cat. My cat likes this brush better. Guess which one we use more?

My cat goes absolutely nuts for this brush and enjoys using it. It does get some hair off of him, so I appreciate that. You can twist the brush and peel the hair right off.

I knocked off a star because the twisting function is great except about five of the plastic bristles got bent and are now permanently stuck inside the brush. Overall it doesn't affect the use by much, but it's annoying.",4
Dog loves them!  Wholesome treats for dogs!,5
I bought this sweater for a dog that I rescued. Mary Jane had nothing to wear in the cold so this was perfect for her to put on and keep warm when she was running around outside.,5
"I now find our cat in his heated cabin every cold morning and during the day sometimes.  She didn't like it until I covered the back door with a towel.  Cleo is a small cat, about 8 pounds, and old.  She seems to like the fit and the heat is just enough.  This would be too small for a large cat.

It would have been 5 stars if it didn't have two entrances.",4
"i am posting this from my cats point of view- she only liked a few flavors. it is good quality food. and i have a very picky eater- so she likes what she likes. and i just gave the cans she didn't like away because it isn't worth the hassle of returning them for money back.

i gave 4 stars as it arrived on time and was the correct product, but i won't be purchasing again because Ms. Whiskers isn't into it.",4
Mixed review! Ive been buying these for over a year. This batch seems to be much smaller than previous and my dog was less interested in them. Not sure the reason. Will buy another to see.,3
My chihuahua had the squeakier out in an hour.  I won't buy again.,1
"ehhhh, I do not know why they put glue inside the bowl to hold down the product paper. My Sulcata got his poor little legs stuck on it and I had to go at for about 45 minutes with a razor to finally get only some of it off because it was so adhered to the bowl. Other than that it is a good product.",3
Perfect! Really great products,5
great love it,5
It works when it wants too. Sometimes it will beep but the majority of the time it will not hear my dogs bark so it won't beep. Will not recommend.,1
I love this toothpaste! It smells great and my dogs love it! What else could I ask for! It also seems to work very well compared to other dog toothpaste brands. I've tried them all and this one seems to keep the teeth the cleanest. My dog has a rare tooth condition that requires we brush his teeth every single day and he has to go in for dental cleaning about every 4 months so we we buy a new tube of this toothpaste every couple of weeks.,5
My dogs love Grandma Lucy's products.  They are a great option for daily meals and all you do is add water.  Dogs lick their bowl clean.,5
A little tall but perfect for a Zen tank,4
Red looks handsome on a black dog.,5
HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS ON MY LEUKEMIA AND FIV KITTIES-WORKS WONDERS ON THEM! WILL ORDER AGAIN-CAME FAST,5
"I have a miniature dachshund and he destroyed it within a few days, but he enjoyed it while it lasted.",4
Each cow ear is huge!!,5
"Destroyed into bits and pieces! Although I will say it took longer than other toys did, but in the end the outcome was the same.",1
Great stuff.  Helps with my Chihuahua 's dermatitis and he also will eat it.  I have used for about 2-3 weeks and do see improvement in my dog's skin issues and scratching.,5
Dog use to like them. Put a few in his toy when I left the house and came home to find out it made him throw up. So won't be buying again. Not sure if it he threw up because of the treats or something else. But won't be taking another chance,3
"CANT SAY MUCH IT JUST DIDN'T WORK ON MY DOG,(SHEPERD)",2
"Very easy to fill,  and my birds love it. I love this feeder. Very high quality. You.cpuld even paint it if you wanted.",5
Dogs like it a lot.  Holds its shape under their weight.  One is 60 lbs. and the other if 100 lbs.,5
"Surprised by how tough it is. Our lab destroys most toys within hours. This one has held up for a very long time, and he loves playing with.",5
"Sometimes even the best dog will decline to take her pills. Antibiotics can be pretty bitter, but Pill Pockets make them go down easily!",5
"very cheaply made fell apart as I tried to put it in the cage, saved most of the balls. for the price not good would not by again.",3
First food to finally stop my poor dog from scratching itself to death!,5
"I did a bit of research before making this purchase.  They are a little pricey at about 20.00 for a can.  I had my doubts that this would work, but decided to give it a try anyway.  I have cats that will get up on my kitchen counter and I couldn't get them to stop..  Cats tend to do as they please and no amount of taking them off the counter would slow them down.  I ended up ordering 6 of these.  All but one of the cans was easy to get set up.  I had alot of problems getting the top on one of the cans because they don't come assembled.  But, I can say with confidence that this product works!!  My cats no longer get on the counters in the kitchen.  The spray coming out of the can is harmless, but the cats do not like it at all and will not go anywhere near them.  Cats are smart and honestly all they have to do now is just SEE the can and they don't go near the place that they are sitting.  The can of spray lasts several months and the refills are not that expensive.  I highly recommend this product to keep your cat away from places that you don't want them.  It's very effective and worth the money.",5
"My dog was only interested in this after I filled the center with treats, and after chewing it a few times the edges became so sharp they would irritate her mouth. I know they're supposed to help gums but this was cutting up her lips and snout.",1
Snacks are a lot smaller then I thought they would be. Will not buy again.,2
"Happy with the bell, SOOOOO over priced. You can very easily make this for about $4 with craft store items. It arrived in an envelope and a thin plastic bag with a card with directions and two screws. We do use it and yes my dog uses it properly, although sometimes she just like to play with it to hear it ring. Very cheaply made, but a good loud ring and easily attaches to the wood part of the door. We used comand strips as we live ina  rental and didn't want to have screw marks",4
These bags are awesome!!! I honestly purchased them because they seemed like the best quality for the cheapest. I have a few dogs so I usually go through them and end up spending a bit. Green is my favorite color so naturally I chose these for the color. Lol. But they turned out to be pretty good bags. I really like that the roll on the inside is cardboard instead of plastic.,5
"Too big for my chihuahuas ( 2, 5 and 9 lbs).",4
"I unfortunately do not have the right dog or the right yard for this Havahart wireless fence.  Well, my younger boy sheltie would probably do well with it, but he sticks to me like glue when outside anyway (he's a scaredy cat and he sees me as a beacon of safety).  My older girl sheltie is another matter.  We didn't get far in the training for her.  We tried, but it became clear that a wireless system won't work for her.  It's likely because she's a sheltie - our regional sheltie rescue will not adopt out any sheltie to a home that does not have a physical barrier fence because a wireless fence isn't good enough.  With the sheltie breed's strong herding instinct, they're good at ignoring the collar's corrections to chase after whatever needs chasing... this is very true for my girl sheltie.  When a neighbor dog barked or she caught sight of a squirrel, she didn't give a hoot about the collar or about me trying to train her.  We've had her for 5 years and she's always been this way despite our best efforts - if I'm standing right next to her she usually behaves pretty well, but if I move away or turn my back, she's all about the barking and chasing.  Fortunately, she comes running to us when she hears the sound of the puppy treat jar being rattled.

As for the yard, our property is 2.5 acres but it's mostly heavily wooded.  The woods creep up closer than 40 ft to the house in some parts so the fence didn't work there.  Also, we live in a rural area where there are coyotes who injure or kill neighbor dogs, and a wireless fence doesn't keep the coyotes out of our yard.  (Even with a physical fence, I don't leave my furkids outside unattended because of this.)

If you have a dog who doesn't have a strong herding/chasing instinct and a non-wooded yard that's at least 40 feet away from the controller in all directions, this Havahart fence might work well for you.  It didn't for us, so that's why we have an inexpensive fence made of steel fence posts and wire fencing - this works for our shelties and it blends into the background very well.",3
Shipped fast but my rabbit has no interest,3
"Had one of these for our ferret.  He looked adorable in it, but didn't like it at all.  This one is for our teacup chihuahua puppy.  The fit is perfect, and he loves it.  I wish we could select color though.  I have two red now!",5
I bought this so i could get another rat to keep the one i already have company. It is built well n easy to clean. There is plenty of room for them to get their exercise.,5
"This is a precious dog coat that really keeps our miniature dachshund warm. Very good quality, durable and washable. So cute to look at too!",5
Fast shipping from overseas. Used this to connect a pump to a desk top fountain,5
"I've had this light for less than a month and while sitting here it just exploded. No water came into contact with it or anything but it just shattered. Took me an hour to get all the glass out of the tank and refill it back up. I'll be ordering another light from another provider in the future.

Update 7/18/13: After some other competitors lights exploded I went back and decided to figure out what was going on. It appears some water had splashed up on the bulbs and shattered them. I take back my review and have since purchased a set of these (found them cheap) I'll rate these again after I've used them for some time.",3
Irked great,5
"My power chewer dog, splinters these bones.  Causes her to get sick.",2
"Trying to find the correct extension to add a panel to this three panel (including the gate panel).  I need the EVEN extension.  And I need white since the fence is white.  This fence works great, but need the extension for a better fit.  A better design would be to make the panels interchangeable rather having to order ODD or EVEN.",4
My dogs like playing with the ball but there favorite thing is to make it squeak. The squeaker broke within 15 minutes of play.,1
Cats like it and that's what matters.,4
"This product was supposed to be red based on the image, but it was not. It is blue. Also based on the image one would assume there was no squeaker, but there is. Product image was misleading. My dog already had a whole in it in about 15 minutes and she wasn't even doing anything more than sucking on it. If she had truly been playing with it, that would be normal, but she wasn't.",1
"Twice the product at half the price. The only difference I see is sometimes there will be bigger worms than in the smaller containers but since I have the bottomless pits known as gourami and molly, they love it",5
"This is a great toy, strong and durable.  My lab loves it, when he finally gets to the stuffing I just pull it out and he plays with the outer cover.  It takes him quite a long time to get to the stuffing though about 6 months.",5
"My husky put a hole in the cover within one night, but company provides excellent customer service and quickly sent a replacement cover as per the warranty. With a strong chewer bed will work great if used while supervised, but won't hold up to unsupervised use.",2
Tried for over a month he didn't care for taste saw no improvement in skin it got worse will go back to omegease,2
Great price.  Great product.  Have raised over 30 kittens on it so far.,5
this toy is cool and original. ships fast. my vizsla loves it. also she hasn't even put a hole in it with her razor teeth,5
"This product should not be used on furniture.  It destroyed my leather chairs and couch, it could not be removed without tearing the leather.  They will now have to be recovered or replaced.",1
It's made of real wood and metal screws and is a perfect fit for my 75 gallon tank. You don't have to worry about paint chips coming off. This is not pressed wood with a cheap coating. It's the genuine article. There is a ton of storage space below and the two doors in the front fit and close perfectly. I couldn't be happier and highly recommend this stand!,5
"My last Flexi Leash lasted more than 10 years of daily walks with a dog who loves to pull. I think the only reason our old one died was trips to the beach where salt water and sand got inside. The new one seems just as sturdy and well made. I love that it has a ribbon lead instead of the old style cord, which can be quite dangerous if it wraps around your finger or legs when the dogs takes off unexpectedly.",5
Great.,5
My puppy loves her new car seat! Perfect size..easy to secure in car. Nice quality! Thank you for the prompt delivery....,5
"Well packaged, good condition, arrived quickly.  The lettering was perfect and the hardware is good quality.  Needed this to replace a smaller one, my puppy is growing up.  The collar is easy to adjust and the snap works perfectly.",5
I have 7lb dogs and give it as a treat. They expect it in the morning.,5
This was a life saver! I have a 125 pound dog. He's 11 and starting to have some trouble jumping out of the truck. He was hesitant to use the ramp at first but after some convincing he uses it all the time. It's very light but strong.,5
I have two Boston terriers and a pug and this ball is the one that they pick to play with. They like tennis balls but for some reason they like to pull the fuzzy material off the balls so I don't buy those for them any more. These balls are great they have really good bounce and are very durable. Will definitely buy more of these!!!!,5
"I am using this for my 55gal red ear slider turtle tank. Have no complaint on its power or noise level. I would like to see a better way to carry unit, and the handle on the top I would not trust to carry the weight of the filter filled with water.",5
This works great!,5
"Really nice quality, true to size",5
"Best dog shampoo ever.  I have tried several, this one is nice and foaming to apply, rinses well and leaves your dog's coat smooth and smells good for days!  It is hard to find but Amazon always has it, good price and delivery.",5
"Since I got this product for my 2 German Shepherds it works great!, bayer is a great company and has great products.
They never got any type of bugs.",5
"Most amazing litter disposal system ever. This is great. I empty the litter box ever 3 days into this contraption and then i empty the contrraption ever 2 1/2 weeks. So much easier!!!

If you have a litter box try this you won't be disappointed.",5
"they are crazy over this treat. When I grab this in my hand, they are all trying to be a good boy or girl. they just love it!!!!!",4
Looks amazing. Fits well and easy to use. Fetty approves. Will get this again for my next tank.,5
My cat loves this! Great investment for her entertainment.,5
"German shepherd delight! My 2 shepherds love these bones I have never had any problems with them eating these ham bones they have been eating them for many years  So juicey and meaty, they  absolutely love them, I got mine at a better price 4 for 18$ but it's nice to know I can get them on amazon...",5
It is pricey but it's worth the price. It takes my dog (7 month old lab) a couple days to eat one. They are made in the USA which makes the price worth it and the braided twists seem to be a favorite for my dog- and it makes them last longer,5
My cat pretty much hates this cat food.  She has to be very hungry to eat is will never buy again,1
loves em,5
"Somehow, someway this little thing has managed to survive Kane's wrath!",3
"My new kitten just hit 12 weeks old and was tortured by fleas. I didn't want to use a cheap shampoo that I wasn't sure would help her, and I wanted something as non-toxic as possible. This was my first purchase of this brand, and I'm pleased to say I wasn't totally disappointed. (the smell is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars)
My experience:
Definitely follow the directions and do NOT wet the fur first.
Yes, the consistency of this is nearly like water, so be careful applying it. It doesn't go far. One bottle bathed two cats, one of which has a TON of fur, the other, not so much (kitten).
The scent is horrid. I hated it, my cats hated it. BUT...IT WORKS!!!! (And their fur was VERY soft after.)
The fleas died instantly. My older cat only had three or four go down the drain, since I had given him a bath a week ago when I noticed my new kitten had fleas. When I bathed the kitten there must have been two dozen dead in the tub. After a good towel and air dry, I combed through the fur and found a few more dead.
It's now the day after bath day and I haven't seen either one scratching or biting at themselves. I think this shampoo may have done the trick. *just a word of advice from experience: do wash their kitty beds and de-flea (LOL) the house as well, or the shampoo will only be a temporary fix. I actually shampoo my carpets with dog flea shampoo to help! Sergeants gold...works like a charm!
I'll definitely be buying this again!!!",4
"I was in hopes in that it states it as being automatic that it would detect the constant yipping of the dog.
Unfortunately that has not been the case.
It seems to only be effective if the dog is barking for several minutes not the constant yipping intersected by a loud bark.
So have moved on to another product.",3
"The two vertical bars are sturdy, but the three tube bars slide so dog can get out. Was very disappointed in this Pet barrier what a piece of junk should have throwed the money I spent on this out in the street for all it was worth!",1
Okay product,4
works,5
Durable as expected. But very very large and heavy for my 80lb mix border collie.,4
"A real nice clean setup for food and water. My puppy won't use it, maybe when hes bigger.",4
Lasts for months. Super warm and just bright enough to give a subtle nightlight,5
"As someone new to the saltwater hobby, this was a bit confusing to set up with the poor instructions but once I got it figured out it was amazing to see how much CRAP this thing pulls out of the water",5
This is great for dog food.,4
"It is perfect for our Belgian Shepherd puppy who doesn't bark, but she does ring this bell when she needs to go out. It has a clear tone, just the right amount of volume for our back door. A pretty sound, not irritating. It was easy to install.",5
We've had one that's lasted through two big dogs and is still unbroken(maybe a little dirty)  I don't know quite what the fascination with this is but dogs love it.  I stuck an extra tennis ball in one to give a little more challenge.,4
"Great for tiny dogs, doesn't add weight to their collar.",5
GREAT,5
"Doesn't have corn products in it.  My basset has very sensitive skin and ""Taste"" seems to work for him. A bit expensive but worth it - along with a mixture of avocado.",5
Our dogs love these.,5
"This is an all-plastic scooper, except for the two springs that close the jaws.  This makes it rust-proof (except for the two springs that could easily be replaced if needed) and allows me to keep it hung outside on the far side of the gazebo with no fear of weather damage.  The plastic rinses very clean when that's needed.  The grip and spring action is an excellent firmness, making it very easy to use by just allowing the spring pressure to close the jaws and to hold them closed when loaded.  There is enough spring pressure to pick up even in grass, as long as you use a bit of the appropriate wrist action to align the jaws.  The jaws themselves are a little over 6"" wide and will open to just a bit over 4"" from tooth to tooth.

All of the plastic is quite heavy duty, and when used as designed I expect it to last a very long time.  Having said that, I stand about 6' tall and over 200 lbs, and the excellent length of this scooper is about the length of a cane for me, so I find that I have to resist the urge to use it as such when walking.  Since the hinge pins are also (non-rusting) plastic, if I were to start to make a habit of leaning on it as I walk, then I would not expect those plastic hinge pins to last very long.",5
"This toy is adorable but so very tiny! I know it is for small dogs and I have an eight pound Yorkie but it can't be more than a few inches long. She has toys much larger that she enjoys that are made for small dogs. There is nothing ""wrong"" with this toy but beware that is very tiny. Good for a little puppy or tiny dog. Molly prefers toys with a little more fluffiness and depth to them. She doesn't play much with this toy unless I engage her and try to toss it around and have her fetch it. Had I known how tiny it was, I would not have purchased it. Still, as I said, no real issues other than the size.",3
It is exactly what I needed BUT I ordered an X-large according to the measurement scale and it is a little too big for my dog. When I get some extra money again I will reorder a large. Thank you,4
I purchased this item in addition to the flake food I normally provide. These pellets float on the top and the fish seem to like it.,5
"super cute toy , but read the sizes first, i thought it would be way bigger (my fault) - my pup still loves it",5
"WARNING! This product contains CARRAGEENAN, a thickening agent made from red seaweed that promotes tumors and cancer in animals. The cans are also not BPA-free which can lead to health problems, as well. There's been quite a bit of research done on this ingredient(most if it ultimately advising pet owners to steer clear of it). The only studies that claim it's safe for pets are, of course, industry funded. Most canned pet food contains carrageenan, even the high end brands. Search online and you will find several petitions to remove it from the market because of its associated health risks. I no longer purchase foods with carrageenan (for either my dog or myself).  I just hope the damage isn't irreversible.

It's upsetting and irritating that ""premium"" pet food manufacturers would sneak a cancer causing ingredient with no nutritional value to their unsuspecting customers. We buy their products because we believe them to be unquestionably safe and of the highest quality. We love our pets too much to take unnecessary health risks. Maybe they'll take notice and change their formulas when sales drop.

Some quality brands that are free of carrageenan are Nature's Variety Instinct, Weruva, Fromm, and Lotus. I have given my dog both Nature's Variety and Weruva and both are highly recommended (although, unfortunately, neither company uses BPA-free cans).",1
My cats enjoyed receiving this for Christmas. I like that it's all natural as they tend to chew on their toys. Would recommend.,5
"My 12 year old Golden/Lab mix loves it. She was on Wellness dry until her teeth started getting sensitive. At her age she needs nutritious food to keep her healthy, not all the fillers that are in the cheep dog food. I use Wellness for all my pets diets.",5
We've had these for all our dogs. They are soft and easy to get on an off. They wash well in the machine and last forever! One of our dogs wears her 10 year old one and looks sharp. We bought this one only because our dog ran through a fence and tore the rim off the top. Get one!,5
I am never without these.  My two poms get one every morning. They jump around and get so excited when I go near the container. I have read that they may be made in China.  My dogs have been eating one of these a day literally for years and they are seldom sick.  I buy other treats too but this s their favorite. A little pricey but my pups are worth it,5
"These are my fav dog treats.  I have a 5-pound toy poodle who has a tendency to have bad teeth.  I don't want anything that can stick to his teeth.  These are light, airy (with pockets of air inside), and packed with flavor.  They are small enough to give during the day (for going to the bathroom outside, etc.) without being too filling.  I keep them in a basket hanging on my hat tree and they never get soft or spoil. Love, love, love these!  And so does Bilbeau!",5
"I bought this when trying to get our cat to stop jumping up on the dining room table. Whenever it was on the table, even if it wasn't turned on, he avoided it. I could definitely see putting it on the counter as well. The only problem is when you're at home and needing to use the space - can't have it turned on then :)",4
I gave my miniature poodle her monthly bath that she gets before applying her Advantix. She didn't seem to mind this. It smelled good and she seems to be scratching less (itchiness is a regular problem for her).,5
"I hedged a little on paying this much for a cat ""toy,"" but knew my Maisie would love it. I never could have thought this one up, but wow!! does she adore it. It's definitely worth the money. Maisie loves laying on it and playing in it. It is her ""safe place,""  and we leave it spread out in our great room. Her favorite thing is to stalk her Da' Bird in and out the holes, as well as other toys. This has to be the best thing I've ever bought her. She knew right away it was hers and set to marking it. She no longer snags our carpet because she uses the Ripple Rug. I've had it 6 weeks now and she's still playing in it like she did from day 1. This is a truly great toy and very durable. I can't thank SnugglyCat enough for coming up with it.",5
These work nicely and are not too loud or snippy sounding that will upset my very shy yorkie-poo. I would highly recommend using these for a nice smooth finish.,5
"For a freshwater tank, works for me great.",5
Nice.  My puppy loves them!,5
useful for rainy days,4
The dogs love this brand.  A little pricey but when it's on sale it's a good price for a high quality food.,5
My dog just loves these chews. It's the first thing he wants in the morning. I think they help keep his teeth clean in between cleanings at the vet. You save at least half buying them from Anazon versus the big pet supply chains.,5
love this item,5
"Did nothing for my cat's as far as behavior. It gave him sores around his neck, I don't recommend.",1
3 corgie approved. .,5
"I wanted to have a harness for my cat during our move, so that we could let her out of the car during our pit stops. It took her awhile to get used to it -- she kept rolling around trying to scratch it off -- but with some time she got used to it. She definitely couldn't get it off, and that's what mattered! I also liked that she didn't choke herself when she strained against it. Whenever I had to reign her in, it was just like a sturdy brace around her upper body. It doesn't dig into her throat or chest.

However, I got the small/medium size for my 8-lb cat, and it is WAY too big. The XS would have been much better. But it still works okay for when I need it.",4
Great toy/activity and great on price.  Keeps my birds busy and will actually last for a while.,5
"Draw string is not stitched in at all, it really slides down, making it difficult to close.",3
"Take a close look at the bottle.  It says ""super strength.""  Whereas I had to use 2.5 mL of another water conditioner for my 10 gallon tank, I only have to use 0.5 mL of API.  That is huge, especially now that I've switched to a larger tank.  This bottle is going to last me forever, as long as the fish live that long.  So far, they're okay.  The super concentrated stuff hasn't killed them yet.",5
Nice brush and works well on small dogs too!,4
I have a very smart . Therefore I had to reduce the amount of recommended pumps.,3
"It took a bit of getting used to, but our puppy now loves it! Every time I pull it out he goes crazy and can't wait to play :) we use it at dinner time to keep him occupied while feeding him! Two birds one stone",5
Good supplement!!,5
Great toy! My year and a half old boxer loves it!!! He has had it for months now and it still has not been destoryed (KONG FOR THE WIN)! I would recommend to anyone who has an aggressive chewing dog,5
"Keep the hair completely off the carpet and seat until the zippers on the sides broke.  I am very disappointing, we travel a ton with our dogs so wee use it frequently and my dogs aren't hard on it, they are English bulldogs so they don't really move a whole lot yet from just zipping and unzipping we lost the zippers on the side.  I will buy a different one in the future, very bummed, if the zippers were not cheap I would keep buying this product.  originally I gave it five stars until zippers broke.",3
"High quality design and lead is the perfect length for a toy breed when neighborhood cruising. My dog is a rescue and came from his foster family with a harness that you would think he would prefer due to it's simple thin straps. Not so. He *wants* to wear the Puppia and refuses the other now. I'll be purchasing more in different colors because he loves it.

I love it too because it's easy to put on. The strappy harnesses confound me for some reason. They get twisted and generally I fumble with them. Not so with this combo. Simple on, Simple off.

Great product at an outstanding price = Happy pet and owner!",5
This stuff works!!!!! Put these anywhere a pet goes that you don't want them to and they'll stop going there for sure. We put one outside our bedroom door so the cats wouldn't wake us up early in the morning and now we sleep well. One cat wouldn't stop p-ing in a certain corner of the house and once we put one of these there she stopped right away. Even when they run out just the presence of the sprayer stops them from approaching. They last quite a while too.,5
Our dog loves this noisy ball!,5
"Awesome!!!! I want more!! Different designs please! I use a feminine pad, teen size for a liner and there are great!",5
Got this for my Russian Winter White hammy along with the Kaytee Ceramic Critter Bath for his sand baths. :) He LOVES it. He runs into it and spends so much time rolling around in it and digging in it. Best money I've spent in a while!,5
"Works great in my 2.7g betta tank. You can't understand just how dirty a betta fish is until you replace his gravel with white sand. I run this filter twice a day at full flow for about 15 minutes. Each time it launches an amazing amount of poop and other debris into the water column. He hides safely, and I run the filter until the water and sand are absolutely pristine (using Purigen). Every other day I'll push the flow to the lowest setting and run the filter for an hour or so.

I will NEVER go back to gravel. The quantity of pollutants that it holds is neglectful. Sure you can vacuum it, however, a ridiculous amount of waste builds up and pollutes the water in between vacuumings. I believe I've found the ideal setup.",5
"My 10 year old lab service dog LOVES this bed! I bought it for my office at work. Very nice looking and very comfy with great support for her old joints. She is very happy with it and gives it 5 stars! I got a L and she is an 87 lb lab, she could have done with a size bigger, but I put it on top of her old office bed for anything that hangs over ",5
"My kitten loves this so much it is hard to get her to come out of it! Such a simple idea, we all know how cats love boxes, but this is wonderful for them. Also add the ""Ethical Slotted Balls"" by Ethical to the mix and your cat will go crazy! This is not for a LARGE cat, say over 6lbs or so, cause the hole is not big enough for their heads and the length is not very long for big cats, in my opinion anyway.:) Could be wrong and I am sure someone else has bigger cats playing with this. Look at all the reviews. Anyway, love this.",5
My GSDs love these!!!,5
My dogs LOVE these!,5
This is my favorite bag holder!  Withstands getting wet on the beach and full of sand!,5
"Stinky, greasy, hard bits of big & small bones that smell like chemicals.  I threw in garbage.",5
"Our cat loves to bite into these. I thought they looked large for cat treats but she has never refused these, though she is sometimes indifferent to other treats. They seem reasonably nutritious, so go for it.",4
puppy can't get enough. loves it,5
I can't believe I didn't buy these earlier!  My dog loves making these squeak.,5
"This spray removes more stain (vomit, urine) than other stain removers. It also works on dog messes. The enzyme breaks down a special protein found in cat urine that makes it a particularly difficult stain and odor to remove.",5
our cats love this!,5
"I bought this as one of my cats had a severe UTI and I was concerned about it coming back.  This product, even when mixed with their regular cat food (while transitioning) made them both throw up numerous times.",1
Makes a great gravy that my dogs love!,5
dogs love it - always fresh. easy to measure - nice large size which last a long time.  Arrives fast and fresh,5
"Have had this for a several weeks.  Works great, love the two tone warning method. My dog adapted to this in only two barking tries.  She barks twice and gets the two warning tones. The tones distract her enough and she stops barking.  She has adapted by teaching herself to growl loudly, fortunately not loud enough to annoy the neighbors. Two issues, but not bad enough to impact my review, buy extra batteries as my dog wore out the batteries almost weekly at first.  My experience is that the collar doesn't prevent barking only controls the duration and the number of barks. The batteries are inexpensive.  Second issue is if you have a second dog close by and that dog barks it will set off your dog's collar.  I just remove the collar for these times.",5
cats are eating it,5
My dog loves this!!,5
"My dog is an almost 60 lb pit/lab mix.  She fits in the bed nicely and there is still some room left over, maybe enough for a 15 lb dog to be in there with her if they both like to cuddle close.  It definitely seems smaller than advertised since my dog lays in this bed curled up and takes up most of the supposed 40"" which is fine for us, but may be a problem for others.  I believe one of the other reviewers gave some measurements.  My dog loves to snuggle up against things so she definitely LOVES the bolster.  She will even willingly leave the couch to get into this bed sometimes, which is one of the reasons I got it in the first place (to get her off the furniture).  She went to it immediately when I put this bed next to the chair, so I took that as a sign she likes it.  On the other hand, I am already regretting the lack of flexibility in cleaning this bed.  I probably missed this in the description, but the interior of the bed is some sort of imitation sheepswool or something.  In other words, everything that can stick to this bed will stick to this bed and be impossible to vacuum out.  We've had it for 5 days and have already been on my hands and knees picking pieces of bully stick out of the fur.  Not my favorite pastime.  My washer is definitely not large enough to wash the whole bed, not that I would want to unleash that type of debris on my washing machine, so you would probably want to take this to a laundromat.  For me that's a pain in the butt, it may not be a drawback for others.  The price is incredible, about half the price of other beds I considered, and my dog does love this bed, so I consider it a good buy.  I was considering a second one for downstairs, but I think I will choose an easier to clean bed.  Please make one with removable cover!!",4
My yorkie loves them.,5
"This is a darling sweater.  I use it for my Shih Tzu puppy, and get many compliments about how cute it is.  Easy to get on and warm enough for 30 degree, sunny Colorado weather.",5
My dog uses the crate daily and enjoys it more since I added the Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed that fits inside it.,5
"This was a great buy. It's not too heavy, but I didn't expect it to be. Serves the purpose on our pup's collar and is very cute!",5
Great bell for keeping track of my dog outside. He is still learning to stay in the yard and out of the corn field. We need to be able to hear where he went so we can call him back and it has helped a lot to correct him to get back in the yard before he leaves it. The large bell wouldve been too large for our 65 pound large Boxer.,5
Dog loves them!  Keeps him occupied and out of trouble.,5
"We use this for 2 cats, holds enough for 5-6 days.....perfect for summer weekend getaways",5
Smaller than expected,3
Catahoula Leopard dog is an average chewer.  Solid Nylabones hold up just fine for her. On this one she was able to start breaking down the green plastic within a day.  I would not recommend or leave my dog alone with this bone.,1
Runs smaller than advertised,3
My dog just takes them off,2
Awesome,5
Seems to work for our dog.,5
"My cats love this as much as I do. It keeps them from dragging dirt (or whatever the grass is in) out of the bowl and gettin it everywhere. Its super easy to maintain and grow. Now it keeps dying though, because my fattest cat loves to lay on top of it like its yard grass.",5
Worked too well or I need a bigger dish.,5
"Actually, all my parrots love this food. Parrots can be as fussy as cats when it comes to their seed. Amazon price for this product is great.",5
This toy breaks easily and turns into smalls pieces of cloth that are easily eaten by my pup.,1
"Food is good - we've used it for our Great Danes for years.  Price is reasonable too.  My only quibble is they are slow to ship, so you may not receive in 2 days like with other Amazon Prime.",4
"Such a simple design, but our cat is obsessed!!  Will continue to buy.",5
"these fit very well, work as they are supposed to. very happy with these",5
"so far its working great - doesn't burn ears and dogs don't really fuss when I go to use it on them - I don't however, pour it into the ear I just use a cotton ball and soak it - works better and no waste nor does it get all over the place when the dog shakes her head",4
This and the EVO dry have been a life saver for my older cat. She loves them both and it really agrees with her tummy.,5
Love these crackle balls in all sizes. Will definitely buy another on very soon! My Boston Terrier enjoys this ball in every size. He loves to chew an to chase balls,5
"Purchased two of these beds in size Large, a little over two years ago and find they have been well worth the investment. It took a few weeks for my two Boxers to warm up to their new beds - probably because I didn't remove their older beds.  Two years later, both dogs are quite comfortable on these beds and I often find them lying completely outstretched, in deep sleep.

Both tend to retreat to these beds whenever I give them a long lasting chew - I assume because of the support under their elbows as the hold onto their treats.  Thankfully, the cover of this bed is easy to remove, washes beautifully, and is easy to replace. After two years and multiple washes, this cover looks as good today as it did when new.

My dogs are 60lbs and 80lbs so the large size works well for both...they even manage to cuddle together on one bed from time to time. Because they like to cuddle, I considered purchasing just one of the XL or Giant instead of separate large beds. In the end, I'm happy with separate beds - especially given the footprint - they take up a lot of space. I can more easily place two smaller beds in my family room than I can one huge bed.  The only thing I might do differently in hindsight is buy the less expensive version without the headrest...my smaller dog never uses it and my boy, only rarely.

So, while I initially had concerns about spending close to five hundred dollars on two dog beds, I have to admit that I got my money's worth. There is no sagging, I have not needed to replace or repair the covers. When clean, the beds looks new. When I have to move them around they are easy to lift (unlike other dense foam products). Most importantly, both of my dogs really get restorative sleep on these beds. Highly recommend!",5
"Our dog, a Belgian Malinois, can destroy almost anything. This wheel is still going four months later. She loves this toy! It came in powder blue not pink, but oh well.",5
"I have a small dachshund, he is 12 pounds. This does beep, but it does not keep him from barking. Had to go back to the next bigger size in a different brand. The mint box is very tiny, it's for little bitty dogs and even though he's sensitive, this didn't deter mine from barking when excited.",3
"The self-warming pet crate pad is wonderful.  It's machine washable too.  The corners are ""split"" so it'll fit well in a crate, however I bought it as a window perch pad.  My cats enjoy looking out the window, so I thought this might warm them up while bird watching!  The pad is very soft and flexible.  I have 4 cats and 3 of them instantly loved it.  I had another brand of a self warming pet pad and it made a fairly loud crinkle noise every time the cats stepped on it, this one, thankfully, does NOT do that.  Excellent price and fantastic find!",5
We have 2 chows.  One will eat anything and the other is the picky eater.  Picky eater had no interest in this.  The other devoured his chewy within an hour.  Will not re-buy as this was one-6-inch stick and felt it was rather costly.,2
"So happy with this litter box! I can see why some people have posted that they even forget to clean it. It controls cat box odor and it just looks nice. I mean, as nice as a cat box can. It does take a lot of litter to fill, but that is not something I mind.",5
Super cute,5
"Suggested sizes are way off. Ordered by size chart and even measured my dog several times and the neck was still about 1"" to 2"" too large",3
"Very cute on my dog! fits great, awesome quality.  She got it all muddy one day, I threw it in the wash and it came out good as new.  It seems to be more comfortable for her then other collars as well.",5
"I have a betta and needed a feeder that could reliably dispense as little as a single pellet of food for each meal. This is the only one on the market that seems to fit the bill, and it's extremely reliable. I wish it had a greater capacity (fourteen meals is not a lot if you feed more than once a day), and I wish the construction were a bit more premium (it's plastic throughout and feels a bit cheaply made), but I'm still giving it five stars because if you need something that dispenses with precision this item is, if you'll pardon the pun, the only big fish in a very small pond.",5
"I adopted a kitten and due to supply issues, had to change her food the very first night she was here. It caused bad diarrhea that got progressively worse over the next few days. I ordered Forti-flora and the minute I put her on this stuff she was already having better, firmer poos. I worried about the taste but she LOVES it and even tried to eat the powder in their packets. After a few days, no more diarrhea. I kept her on it for 2.5 weeks and now she is completely healthy and happy. This stuff is amazing.",5
works great for vacations,5
"Great balls my dogs are crazy about them, thank you!",5
"really well made, takes a beating",5
"These are great if you choose to NOT declaw your cat.  I couldn't do it, as he does go outside, and it just seemed too cruel to put him thruogh. We place them on his front claws only, and it has saved some of the furniture.  I say SOME because he will eventually ""claw"" them off and we find them through out the house.  Still an improvement on his previous behaviours.  Friends have tried these, but do not like them.  I recommend!! And we try the differrent colors with the seasons (my husband's idea!)",4
Sooo accurate it's crazy! My tank is 100 healthier compared to those little baby strips.,5
everything was prompt and as advertised,4
"light weight, easy to fold.",5
"i saw a cheap price and got it. it's 50% dust with corn and seeds. not a good diet for rats

this is junk for squirrels",1
"These clippers feel nice and heavy in your hand and I was initially impressed with the quality of the clippers - until I started using them.  I started in on my poodle mix and the clippers effortlessly trimmed down his head and front legs, but that was it.  Just stopped cutting.  So my dog now looks like a sheep.  It's kinds cute but not really what I was going for.  Disappointed and returned.",1
"After trying one of the tube style adjustable barriers, I threw it out and tried this one. Instead of it being a 3 person install (just to get it as tight as I wanted), This is a one woman,woman, somewhat laborious job. Stripped wing nut included, I think it was a 45 min install. All of which is WAYYYY less time I spent in the tubular barrier. With this barrier, you can screw it to the desired height and support. The tube ones, I can't even describe what a hassle they are! Just buy this ine. You'll thank me later.
And you're welcome",5
Hoped it would have been more durable and longer lasting than like tennis balls and found out differently when my Lab had the first ball torn to pieces within minutes of receiving it.,2
"This is the only brand I will buy my dogs are healthy, happy and beautiful!",5
"Someone complained that they wish there was more of a variety of colors but the pic clearly shows different patterns of purple. I purchased these because I was tired of the typical ""pink"" everyone gravitates towards when they have a female. Love these clips and the different patterns. Solid craftsmanship and no loose threads or detachments.",5
"I have had 3 Vittles Vault containers. I have the 15 lb size for the cat food and have owned that for 2.5 years. I had the large (65 lb) stackable but it was too large for what I needed so after a year, gave it away and bought this 30 lb. stackable. This is the perfect size for the dog's food, is easy to store, and seems to keep the food fresh. I use the containers inside so cannot attest to how they hold up to pests. I have had no problem with cracks at the top, but the lids do not go on easily. It sometimes takes me several tries to get the lid to line up correctly to close. I can see how these might crack if tightened when not lined up correctly. (If the lid were easier to line up, I would have given it 5 stars.)",4
I bought these for my Wahl Bravura clippers; I wouldn't attempt a grooming session without them. Excellent purchase.,5
"does not work, my dog able to remove it in a second or too, first time took longer, but now it almost instant :)  good material, but bad design",2
"This is the perfect Dog Harness for my Mini-Poodle Person!  I read A lot of the reviews and spent quite a bit of time on the decision to make this purchase, as I was not feeling sure about the sizing, and a friend has given me a similar harness (another brand) that was not to my liking due to how it fit.  With this harness, that was certainly Not the Case.  The fit is Perfection!!  I am going to be buying a few more in other colors, as I LOVE, Love, Love this product.  My mini-poo is on the tall side, and he weighs 13 pounds.  The medium is absolutely perfect for him, as if it was made just for a dog his size, which I suspect it actually was! ;)",5
Good.,5
"I really like the vision cages. I have 3 of them. This cage is very sturdy and roomy. I love how easy the grate cleans up and that you can just dumb the debris from the bottom tray into the trash. It is a VERY clean cage and in general VERY easy to keep clean.

It is pretty difficult to put together tho. I am a petite women and it took me about-at least 30 mins. With the clips and the food doors being the hardest.",5
"Pit will devour this within 30 minutesBut our terrier Took longer. We used it to ease her anxiety when left alone. Unfortunately, she ate the whole thing in one day and it was too much for her Because she never stopped",3
"Unfortunately, my dog hated this. It got so bad that I had to actually pour chicken broth on it to get my dog to even take a bite. This must taste absolutely awful for my dog to prefer starving to this stuff.",1
great,5
My cat says it is purrfect.,5
This is my cats' favorite flavor!,5
"Works rather well, made very well, looks as if that it is indestructible.  Easy to twist off & fill, occupies dog for quite some time.",5
"I was surprised to find shells and small rock pieces within the sand but that is probably a lack on my part for not reading the packaging. The sand is smooth, white, and looks nice. A little testy to aquascape with but most sand is. I recommend rinsing the sand first for ascetic purposes but it is not a necessity.",5
"I had ordered their older model and my Great Dane pup loved it. He isn't a ""power chewer"" but he definitely can chew the heck out of things. The first one began to show red after about 3 months so I researched and found this ""new and improved"" one. I hated the larger price tag but based on reviews I ordered it, that was on June 16th and a month later the end is nearly chewed though and completely unusable not to mention unsafe. My dog doesn't have free reign with the stick, he has supervised playtime with it as a reward. So this shouldn't have happened according to their own product description. My dog hasn't chewed through his KONG this fast! As far as their ""guarantee"" goes, I haven't had anyone contact be back and it isn't listed on Amazon as being guaranteed so I wouldn't bank on that happening either. Just not willing to throw away anymore money on a product that twice has not measured up to all the hype....",1
"My 2 cats love this tree. Their favorite place is in the hammock. I'm so glad I bought this for them. I believe I will eventually have to rewrap the posts with sisal rope, but that's no problem.",5
"Excellent harness, I really like it.  It is easy to put on, fits her really well, fits as expected.  Good quality.",5
"My Annie usually won't try canned cat food, but she did surprise me by, after a bit of investigation, gobbling it down.  The portion is exactly right for a meal for her.  I give her a portion in the morning and one in the evening and she's doing very well with it.",5
Some carefresh lately has been smaller pieces causing more dust. But this one is the larger pieces and much better.,5
Works great. My dog loves it & so do I.,5
"Oh, how I love this sprayer. The installation was super-easy. Then sprayer hose attaches and detaches very easily, you just line up the holes, push it on, turn clockwise and that's it. No leaking. Then to remove you just turn it counter-clockwise and pull straight off. Once the sprayer is on, it gives you multiple options for how you want the spray to come out. My dog was very relaxed with it and it did such a good job of rinsing her. Cut way down on bath-time. The gentle plastic shower sprayer head allowed me to get her face and head cleaned easily by holding it right up against her. It's the little things in life... and I'm just thrilled with this sprayer!",5
I like this product because I can pump a very small amount for each of my Chihuahuas. They are only suppose to have 1/8 tsp each. There is no dripping or leaking which I've experienced before. I know the product is superior because it's wild caught fish and there is no strong odor.,5
"So, I have one finicky indoor cat and three finicky feral kitties. I must have spoiled them along the way some how, because they won't eat just anything. I'm constantly trying to find things to feed the ferals and my indoor kitty that are healthy and won't break me financially.  I stumbled on the reviews of this particular dry food, and ordered it to try out on my ferals.  My indoor cat was addicted to the crappy Friskies I was feeding them (every time I dished out the food for the ferals, my cat begged for some, even though he gets a much better quality food - he wanted the junk food instead). So I wanted to get the Friskies out of the house and get my indoor cat rehabbed off it.  Once I started feeding this to my ferals and they seemed to enjoy it, I let my cat have a few tidbits, and he loves it too.  Will be switching him off his brand of dry to this, along with his canned.",5
"My 14 year old cat wants nothing to do with it.  She much prefers the cardboard-type and an older and shorter sisal rope type post.  Turned out to be a waste of money, even after trying to gain her interest in many ways (laser light--which she loves but even it on the post didn't interest her, catnip, etc.).",2
"These are incredibly cute! I purchased the Pack of 2 - Girl Power..and each one has been adorable on my cat! The bow comes off after some time (usually last 3 to 4 months). Though in my experience, collar accessories always come off after a few months. So I like the ability of purchasing two at a time, especially since they're so affordable. I haven't had any issues with her comfort, getting caught on things, the collar not snapping off her neck, etc. Maybe because she isn't the most active cat and is past her kitten-like curiosity stage, but they work really well for her.",5
Yes and I've used it before It has basically given me a new dog. It's the real stuff Bovine liver powered and it works when you follow the directions.,5
Works good on my carpet and I use it all the time.  Sometimes I will put it with another product when the stain is really bad.,4
My puppies love this toy.  Keeps them busy. Will buy others. Inexpensive.,5
"Confirmed with customer service today that, Small Pet Selects, cannot guarantee their products do not use GMO's and toxic pesticides.  I wrote them a kind letter, requesting that they consider using non-GMO seeds/products.

GMO's are proven to cause cancer and early death.",1
My one cat is a food snob and will only eat this. She gives me slow eye blinks when she eats it ( I love you in cat language ) so of course I will continue to buy it for her. My other cats will eat anything but prefer the pate. Oh..I love this preboxed packaging as they consistently come undamaged in shipping. Photo of Mitzy illustrates her contentment with belly full of this product.,5
My weim LOVES this football!!  He is 13 but acts 3 when he has this in his mouth and running.  Finally a product that that will last more than one afternoon.  I would highly recomend this product.,5
Will not stay on. The hyperthin elastic tie is too fragile to be knotted tightly.,1
"I bought these so we would have spare balls in case we lost the orginial one. I like that they are smooth and easy to clean off.

"Thank you Cat Attract! Yes, I do with it was a ""natural"" litter, similar to World's Best, but this litter has saved my relationship with my kitty. Poor guy was having a hard time and was not using the litter box when we first moved. However, when you have to wipe up poo and pee everyday when you wake up and when you come home, it's hard not to resent your furry friend. After switching to this litter, the accidents slowly decreased, and now we're back to full litter box use. I like the 40 lb bag over the 20 lb because I have two litter boxes, one which is a Catit Jumbo, so the 20 lb bag doesn't last us more than a week. However, the 40 lb bag is not conducive for carrying, so if you live in a walk-up with no elevators, stick with the 20 lb.",5
Small dogs especially love to dig out toys from the log!,5
"My cats love a good catnip toy, and out of all their toys this is by far the one they love the most.  The catnip is super potent, it smacks you in the face when you open the packaging. The banana holds up to their abuse and doesn't rip apart.",5
I would have given it five stars if even one of my five cats would have used it. The product is made well and is extremely easy to put it together. I guess my cats are spoiled with their hidden hollow tree.,2
I have a 14 year old dog that out of no where just started having a hard time holding her bladder while asleep.  This has been a life saver and a laundry saver.  I had my little girl in diapers before this.  Now they have been packed away for nearly a year now!,5
My dogs love them and they have had no gas/bowel issues/etc. Just wish they were cheaper but as a treat who cares.,5
Great!,5
Just what I've been looking for to put in toys I make for my little shih tzu.  Well made too.,5
"Cats turn their noses up at almost everything except FF gravy canned food. The gravy chicken is their favorite. The box was a great bargain, wayyyyy cheaper than buying per can at the grocery store. I will never buy cans at the store again! Because getting it this way is such a fantastic value, plus you don't have to schlep it out of the car- it comes right to you!! how can you beat that??",5
Puppy really likes it. I would buy another I do not like being told to write a review that is a certain number of words,5
"We have two of these now, indoors only.

They allow our cats access to litter boxes in the cellar w/o having to leave the cellar door ajar.
We've also installed one in our bedroom door so it can be kept closed, too.
(We keep the temperature lower....and a/c'ed in the summer!)
Good price for a great option!",5
My 1 year old 60 lb akita/pitbull mix loved this bone but it did not last longer than a week and the pieces that broke off were much larger than rice.,3
"My cats love this, and it helps get mats out.",5
"This is the first liter mat that has actually kept the litter from traveling though out the house in my cat's paws.  The mat really collects any liter carried out by my cat and I have tried tons of mats.  I love how it folds to release litter which makes it easier to empty in the trash or back into the box rather than having to haul it out to the trash outdoors.  My cat did not mind walking over it.  The size is perfect and the design is unique.  I now have ordered an additional one for my daughter who just got a cat and another one for my cabin, for a total of 3 mats.  Well worth it for any indoor cat!!!",5
Esthetcially pretty and seems to be well made. I have the collar in the same pattern. However it does not work at all for no pull on my 60LB Boxer mix... returning it.,1
"I'm disappointed with this costume.  Not b/c it's not cute (I was really excited about it), but b/c the headpiece is made for a very small dog's head, but the torso piece is way too big for my 40lb dog.  Unless you have a small headed chubby dog, this probably won't fit.",2
Bought this for my fat sheltie so we could actually go on walks without the collar slipping over his head.  this fits perfect!,5

"When Carefresh changed their bedding, I tried this for my Syrian ""Teddy Bear"" hamsters. It absorbs urine well and absorbs the smell, too.",5
My two babes go absolutely cray for these treats! And I love that I can feel good about giving them all natural treats that also support their joint health. It's a win-win-win!,5
"Bought one that worked for awhile, then it broke. Got the second one and it didn't work at all. No buzz beep or shock. Junk junk junk. Such a bummer this product doesnt work unpredictably and puts peoples pets and others in danger as a result.",1
"I have this taped to the inside of the window by my front door. It's bright and easy to see. Just right in the number of cats you have in the box. After a year of use I had to rewrite the number of cats in the box  but that might be just the marker I used.  Love it, it gives me a sense of comfort. I got one for a friend too and she loves it.",5
They love it! And I love that they are doing well on it. One with food sensitivity is no longer itchy and losing hair. He's not biting at his feet anymore. We are on our 3rd bag and it is a favorite here.,5
"I bought this toothpaste because I could not find the regular brand.

I started using the paste and my dog Darby developed renal disease and my dog Hampshire developed UT issues.

While research diet changes, I found that this paste has excessive amounts of phosphate that causes kidney/renal failure in dogs.

The top 3-ingredients in this toothpaste is phosphate.  In addition, my dogs did not like the paste. I regret buying this paste and I absolutely do not recommend this paste.

Ingredients:

phosphate, sodium copper chlorophyllin, sodium hexametaphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate,",1
DO NOT BUY- I got a thermometer gadge to go with this bc it says it heats up a lot and that didn't help at all. It only went to burning hot and cracked the tank and wood underneath it. And I had to put carpet on the inside of cage bc the glass was too hot for my snake to actually touch. Eventually i just gave up and went back to a heat rock. It had melted to the glass tank and then was so brittle from the heat it put off it just snapped in half when trying to take it off.,1
"Great quality dog bed, durable material; very happy with purchase. $ but worth every penny!",5
My puppy was having some tummy upsets.  Wellness products were recommended and my dog is healthy and happy.  This is really a top quality product.,5
Dogs love them--use sparingly and only as a treat,5
lasted about 3 months only used it once every two weeks,3
"I bought this along with K-9 Advantiix II and this cheaper,  less well known brand actually lasted a month while I found a few fleas after the two week mark of applying Advantiix.  It's extremely hard finding a good and lasting  flea,  tick,  and mosquito protection for my dogs. Capstar worked immediately but is only made for that.  I does not work for longer than 2-3 days.  So it's honestly a complete waste of money unless you can afford to waste like that. But probably not an option for owner with multiple dogs.
I've run the gamut of natural remedies and they fail miserably while making my dogs smell like some old shoe water juice or something. Very pleased I found an affordable and effective treatment.",5
Don't waste your money. It won't suck enough to make a difference. I get more out of the pond with a basket,1
"My bird isn't scared of too many things, but he was scared of this at first. It's bigger than toys I normally buy for him, however he has adjusted and really enjoys preening it!",5
This stuff is a piece of junk. Isn't even worth $2 and they sell it for $12.. It is not a frisbie. Just a piece of nylon thing..,1
"These plastic balls, about the size of a tennis ball are the perfect size for smaller dogs who aren't the kind to rip and shred. We have three chihuahuas. They enjoyed the squeaking, but only one of them is playful enough to actually play with the balls.

If you have dogs that have stronger jaws, I suggest you get something harder (like a dog tennis ball), but if you are dealing with smaller dogs who enjoy playing and squeaking, these are ideal, plus they are cute for humans to have to look at.

Fun, soft plastic",5
My puppies love this.,5
"It works like it should, but does not eliminate cleanup.",3
Love this thing. My son bought this for his cat and I loved it and ordered one also.,5
Good!,5
"Fast Ship, Excellent item",5
"Yes, it could use more padding. And when looked at the picture it looks like it has alot more padding then it truly does. But i bought it because it was cheap and im trying to train my dog to not chew up her bed and to stay off my bed. Im folding an old comforter to make a bit more cushion and then we should be set. She already like it with the comforter she barked at me when i tried to take it downstairs from being upstairs. She said she was comfortable.",4
My pup thinks this stuff taste great! And she doesn't have dry itchy skin either!,5
Our dog loves this food!,5
My dog loves this thing!!! She loves it so much I had to get two because the only way I can get her to give it back is to have another one ready to throw.,5
I love this one!  Works great!  Smells great!,5
"Great pooper scooper.  This style is available elsewhere, but the natures miracle brand seems more durable than others I've seen.  It works well.  We put a poop bag on the end to act as a cover for the scoop and then use a grocery bag to put the waste into.  I can usually do most of the yard with one bag, and this keeps the plastic scooper clean.  If the waste is very soft it does not work very well and isn't totally effective at getting deep into the grass.",5
"So I think I read every single review on here before deciding to buy this litterbox house. I was a bit worried about shoddy construction or if the inside of the box got wet. Well, I purchased it with the Iris Open-Top Litter Box as suggested and it works great! It was super easy to put together and looks so nice and not cheap at all! My cat loves to kick around her litter, but the shield on the Iris box keeps the sides of this washroom from getting wet. So easy to just open the door and remove the box to clean. If you're on the fence about this one like I was, you should definitely purchase it!",5
"What can I say, my cats love it, all cats love it. That is why I buy it in bulk.",5
"I really like these small bowls. I put one in the car, truck, and RV for my dog. They are so easy to use and they are collapsible. So they don't take up that much room. We take our dog every where and I always had to hunt for a cup for the little guy. Now I don't. They are made from tough like rubber material. I really like the clip on the end so I can hang them up. I got these on a discount.",5
I had one for about 1 week then returned it. it was very loud and it shot millions of tiny bubbles into the tank and making the water look cloudy. I played around with the water level but it still made bubbles. The bio wheel was awesome but it spewed water all over the lid on the filter. I have this tank in my room and i could not sleep with it on. If you have your tank in a living room and baffle the flow with a plant or something like that then you're good to go. This was not a great filter for my needs but it's a overall okay filter.,3
"There is not a description on the heatpad that says it already comes with one of this, so I ended buying it unnecesarily. Some how, this was also too small and when trying to fit,  it broke a little.",2
These tags are the VERY best anywhere.  They are so durable that I only need to replace one when my dog buries it or loses it.  I completely recommend these!,5
Each one of our kinds love their toys. We fill them with dog treats or on special days a little Peanut-butter. We place them in the dishwasher and the clean up is fast and easy.,5
The size is way wrong and to return it will cost almost more money that I paid for it so I'm stuck with a useless item made for a dog the size of a stuffed animal...no way to contact seller to do an exchange..not happy. If you buy one make sure you triple the size. My dog wears a size small in petco/petsmart shirts and a medium in walmart shirts. According to size chart on tag she is a large dog....shes 14lbs...so size is insanely marked. If it was a large it would be perfect and good quality item just upset there is no option for company to make this right other then them stumbling upon this review and reaching out..,1
"My 6-month old Goldendoodle loves this toy. It extends her feeding times to about 20 minutes, and--it's only day 3--but she gets excited when she sees the toy come out for mealtime. She figured out how to spin the toy by her second meal, but the bone inserts are still challenging. The toy's only negative is that it's not that easy to clean. Ideally you could disassemble it to hand wash.",5
"Works great, easy to use. And holds enough food for a weekend away, with the dogs in a pen..:) I still had neighbors stop by, to check on them. But didn't have to worry about feeding them..:)",5
very well made. firm thick foam. supportive for large dog. back rim for resting and head rest. open enough for stretching out. quality fabric. alittle expensive but i've wasted money on several others that did not hold up.,5
Dogs love these,5
received,5
I have purchased this item twice now. Good size. Good absorption. Good quality. Will buy again. Good value too.,5
"My finicky dogs love the chicken stew.  One dish feed one dog twice, so it is a fairly good value.",5
"This is a well made collar, but too big for my Greyhound's 13 1/2 inch neck. I adjusted it as tightly as I could, but I can still fit my hand under the collar. I am afraid she will walk out of it. I had to remove the tags in order to adjust it, so I guess it can't be returned",3
"This is my dogs favorite food!  The price was less than at the store, how could I say no?  A real deal!",5
"Had to trim down my Wheaton Terrier, so I opted to switch to this food, which my dog loves! It's only been a couple of months, but with spring here and more outdoor time, plus cutting back on portions I think this will be a good starting point.",5
decent quality leather,5
great,5
Good quality.  But runs small.  It would not fit our puppy.,2
It has survived my 2 play crazy pups!  They have chewed on it.  Played tug-o-war.  And yet it lives on.,5
"Very well made, fits great. Love the color!",5
my rotties are still chewing on there bones,5
"I have a 7 month old Bengal kitten and a 6 month old Russian Blue kitten. I elected not to declaw them, which means I need to provide several good outlets for them to scratch and climb. They've been trained to only scratch kitty furniture and not my furniture. I ordered this beautiful cat tree because it was very reasonably priced and seemed to have plenty of good places for them to scratch as well as perch. They immediately wanted to play on it even before I got all the pieces out of the box and started assembling it. Assembly was very easy, except the pictures in the directions are slightly misleading, so if you have a picture handy of this item fully assembled to use as a reference, that helps quite a bit. It comes with an Allen wrench to tighten the bolts, and the only other tool needed is a Phillips screwdriver for the bottom shelf where the hammock is attached. Fully assembled the cat tree is 5 feet tall. Once it was fully assembled, I quickly realized the cats will not use the hammock. I may just leave it off all together. They don't use the ladder either, they just jump into the second level instead, but I'll leave the ladder on for now because it looks cute and it's another area where they can scratch if they choose to. I only gave this product 4 stars instead of 5, because, while this is a perfect sized cat tree for my 6 pound kittens, I think some of the pieces will be way too small for them when they grow to be 10 and 15 pounds. There is no way a 10 pound cat will fit comfortably in the little cubby hole or the bowl-shaped cat perch. That is my opinion, but I hope I'm wrong, because everything else about this cat tree is great. A cat tree of this quality and size would be  $150- $200 at PetSmart or Petco, and I couldn't resist the price.",4
What I like the most is that my older cat loves them--as long as it is the easy to digest Pate' version.,5
The XL rope is HUMONGOUS!! Our dog loves pulling with all her might on it. It is easily 2x her size (in length) and she was just recently weighed in at 65#.,5
"I only purchased this brush because my dog recently chewed up his La Salon Essentials curry brush which I liked.  I gave this one a try since it was lower in price.

My first observation is that the rubber on this brush, compared to my first curry brush, is a very dense, hard rubber with some mild flex.  My dog seems to respond better to this brush probably because it has a more massaging/back scratching effect because of that harder rubber.  Whatever the case is, this brush removes his shedding fur amazingly well.  His fur, short fur, was flying off with this brush.  Also, since this is a hard shell brush, I found it easy to hold and use.  The strap is quite small, only 2 of my fingers can go through it.  However, this is a non-issue since the rest of your fingers will be supporting the rubber sides of the brush, making it quite comfortable to use.  The fur seems to collect quickly between the brush bristles but its very easy to remove since it tends to come out in one chunk. Even the color serves a purpose, making it easier to locate when I leave it outside.

Such a simple design, and yet so brilliant.",5
"Helps my dog's feet a lot! My dog does not lick it off so that is good, it is all natural so it would not hurt her anyway.  I use it mostly when we go hiking to protect and condition her feet! I have found nothing even close to being as good! I highly recommend!",5
All API works great.,5
Quick shipment!! Great product. Excellent experience. Thank you !!!!!! :),5
DOGS LOVE EM,3
"Maybe other cats love it, but our cats did not.  The quality of the ingredients is high.  Doesn't seem to be different than what we were feeding them before in the ""no grain"" category, maybe a bit more expensive, but our kitties prefer other brands.  We won't be buying again, but this doesn't mean that your kitties won't love it.",3
Really helps get the mud off,5
"Might be helpful to some dogs, my dog seemed unaffected and I ran 2 of these at the same time in a small home",3
"Pros:This is the nicest looking cat tree I have ever seen!  It it not one of those tacky looking eyesores that are most cat trees.  The 'fake carpet' in my opinion is a plus as the thickly carpeted trees look awful to me.  The material on this cat tree has a furry quality to me that is super soft.  My two 5 month old bengal kittens love it and fight over who will get to be the 'king or queen of the mountain' on top!  The tree does jiggle a bit when they are jumping on or off of the top level, but it's pretty stable.
Cons: I do wish the top level of the tree was larger so both cats as they get to be adults will be able to sleep on it together. it is perfect for one cat.  Also, neither cat seems interested in the hammock or the two cat 'houses' yet, but that may change as they get older.  I may remove the hammock as it is not something most cats feel safe in as it rocks back and forth and is hard to get in and out of.",4
My little 4 month old Maltese puppy LOVES this toy. She has major A.D.D. (lol) and this is the only toy that captures her attention! Thank you!,5
"I have four kittens and they love this stroller!  They look forward to their daily walk everyday.  They jump up into the stroller as if it say ""let's go"".  They sit and watch and smell the smells outside.  They are all indoor kittens and they are so pleased to be able to get outside and enjoy some fresh air on nice days.  At first I thought that this was too much money to spend on a pet stroller, but I researched others and this was a great deal!  I am so happy that I bought this.  It is really the greatest gift I have given my kittens so far!  It even helps me get my exercise which is great:)",5
"The birds have picked on the toys but have not tried climbing on it yet.  Not sure if they will use it or not, but it looks good in the cage and it's large, thick, and good quality.  it's a good buy.  Plus once they tear up the toys it will be easy to add new ones onto this mat.  We have 2 Cockatiels.",4
"I got a size small for my American Eskimo (originally got a medium but it was too long) a few months ago, and he made my baby such a handsome fellow! I wanted to add a bowtie just for fun. It's great quality and I can definitely see it lasting for a long time.",5
"Works great, the instructions to put it together suck. But if you are a half-way intelligent person you can figure it out just by looking at the picture. My cats love it! Doesnt fit exactly how I thought it would so it wobbles a little, but we aren't worried of it falling because of how tight it was just to put it up! Deffinately think its worth the $100 compared to ones half the size for double the money.",5
Works as described,5
"HORRIBLE product. Is making my dog so sick. She throws up every time we give her these or the Alligators. I WONT RECOMMEND and will sue your company if my dogs health doesnt improve.

Also, its been less than a month I bought these and CANNOT RETURN THE PRODUCT.

HORRIBLE.

*edit* affer writing this review, I contacted Amazon and they issued a refund.",1
Good product,5
it os easy to clean it. I love it.,4
"We bought this harness for our German Shepherd in our cars. At first he was not a big fan of it, but it kept him stable through all of our driving situations. The harness looks like a little Kevlar vests for dogs, you can tighten the straps around the neck and around the girth to adjust to your dog. Our German Shepherd has one of the larger sizes, so there's a little bit of extra strap for larger dogs. Like I said before, we first put the harness on, latched him into the seatbelt mechanism in the car, he was not a big fan of it. However, now he associates this Harness with going to the dog park and going to our friends house. He knows that every time we put it on him he's going somewhere, and he gets really excited. He puts his head right through the whole and let's us strap him in and tighten everything up. He then jumps right in the car where we hook him into the seatbelt. The whole car ride he stays secure. I know that if I have to brake or swerve, he's going to be safe in the vehicle and not get injured. Every dog owner needs this for their dog.",5
"These lava bites weren't quite as solid as some I have purchased from other pet stores. My chinchillas had chewed this product into tiny, crumbly pieces in a short amount of time. I had purchased these lava bites thinking they would be more durable for my pets. Im not for sure, but maybe pet stores have changed the material used for these chews. I will stick with safe applewood for my chinchillas to chew to keep their teeth filed down properly...",3
"These are absolutely the best beds for the price! We have four that we use around the house, on the decks, in the dog run, as well as when we travel. Wash up wonderfully and easily!",5
"I don't think I've ever left a one star review. However, this deserves it. Even when trying multiple different angles, it is nearly impossible to read the level of the tiny red line. Saying ""Nearly impossible,"" is being generous. I simply couldn't read it AT ALL unless I got a flashlight and stood at the exact perfect angle...and then, it was with squinting and frustration. I threw it away.  I purchased a JW brand that's magnetic and works great. The main part goes on the inside and a little round magnet goes on the outside. It's strong enough you can grab the magnet part and pull it around to move the thermometer on the inside of the tank. Amazon carries it (link below) but I think Petco had it cheaper.

Cat loves it!!,5
easy to carry - stays in the car so I never have to worry about getting water to my 2 pups.,5
Have been using this for about a year with no issues with my dog.  The worst part is that after you put it on you have to be careful that they don't stain your furniture as they are greasy for the rest of the day.  Have read about bad side effects of this med but both my big and small dogs have had no bad reactions.,5
EXCELENTE,5
no problems,4
"This is a great product!  I've used it for several years, and just recently bought a new container because the old one finally lost its potency.  My kittens were batting at the container and sniffing it as soon as I pulled it out of the box, before I had a chance to unscrew the top!  I rubbed some into their cat condo and scratching post, and they were entertained for a couple hours until they happily fell asleep from exhaustion.  I really like this product because I store their toys in the container with the catnip, keeping them infused with the scent, so my cats never get bored with their toys.",5
"My box turtle is so picky.  Thankfully, she seems to like this better than a lot of the other turtle food I have bought.",4
Our dog loves these!!!,5
Our cat loves 80% of these toys.  She is 7 weeks old.,5
This is great! My extremely picky Goldendoodle will now happily gobble up his food with this on it!,5
"Significantly narrower than my other folding wire crates, but plenty tall enough for my 60 lb dog.  Fits easily in the back of the minivan with plenty of room for the other dogs, and keeps my escape artist safely confined when the tailgate is open.  Very satisfied with this crate and good value for the price.  It was recommended by one of my dog-training friends and I'm passing on the recommendation!",5
"as my 6 pound chihuahua pup (from a corrupt breeder) ""evolved"" into a 16 pound ""chug"" (chihuahua pug mix) aka designer hybrid aka mutt... i've had trouble finding appropriate totes/carriers for the not so little (but lovable) guy.  the dimensions of the large size seemed perfect for his ample (tho not chubby) body.  nevertheless, what the mfr does not tell you is that the 20"" length refers to the top of the bag, not the bottom (a critical measurement in the world of dog totes...) which is only about 16"" long.  hence much smaller than you think and definitely not a bag that provides any elbow room for a 4 legged friend over 10 lbs.",2
"Leia our little Yorkie likes this OK, I think she would like it better if it squeaked, she likes the squeaky toys the best.",3
"As a cat-mum of two, this product is a must-have for any household where the pets occasionally have 'accidents'. This gets the smell out instantly without harsh chemicals.",5
My three Parakeets love this food. Keeps them healthy and there feathers are brilliant!,5
Love the animals filtered water,5
Thanks!!,5
"I have used Feline Pine for years and have six cats and would never use anything else. The new company has changed the product and is not the good product it used to be, so I did a search for regular pine pellets. I found the exact same thing under the name of horse bedding at Southern States and also Tractor Supply where I live and it is only 5.79 for a 40# bad. I was so excited, I even called the new Feline Pine company. I let then know I was very disappointed that they have ruined a great product that I had used for years, but also wanted to thank them because now I have found the horse bedding at 1/4 the price I was paying for Feline Pine. Try some stores near you and ask for horse bedding pellets!!!",1
Took it in the new car on a 2000 mile trip and the dog drank out of it when she wanted and she is a large 100 pound dog and she was able to get her mouth in the bowl wit I'm very happy with it.h no problems.  The bowl didn't tip or spill on the whole trip.,5
"This brush was the least effective of the 4 I have tried so far.

The Love Glove removes more hair.
http://www.amazon.com/Love-Glove-Grooming-Mitt-Cats/dp/B002USK6X6/ref=cm_cr-mr-title

The brush bristles are too short to be that effective.  My long haired older cat gets matts and tangles now especially along her legs.  The hair is short on legs but this brush did not get those small tangles out.",4
"Glad this is avalible, I hate fleas",5
My cats enjoyed playing with it.,5
my cats loves this so much I bought 4 to put around house. He stopped scratching furniture after this!,5
"Fed this to all 6 of my dogs for years, they loved and it they are healthy as can be. My only quarrel is the price but it's to be expected with animal products.",5
Great puppy food! I really liked the small kibbles and the ingredient list.,5
"such a great smell on the yorkie, and keeps her fur soft",5

Ok, now the review: I love this product but my 6lb rabbit barely fits through it in the tunnel shape. At the correct width (he is not overweight) it is not nearly tall enough to be comfortable for him. He will squeeze through it to find his food but would never sit in it by choice. He LOVES tunnels so I ended up putting wood blocks underneath the sides to raise it up higher and he likes it much better now.",3
The dog and cat seem to love it.,5
"Great bone, but my dogs buried it and lost it,",4
"Product arrived today.
Machine had food residues and the manual had stains.",1
"Is very good and yes is strong material...
Puerto Rico",4
I double up my bags. These are the first bags in a while that my cats haven't torn through both! Thicker than other bags Ive used and seem to be sturdier.,5
"Got this for bike rides with my 50-pound pit. The top screws off all the way (I initially thought it flipped off but stayed connected to the bottle, but it comes off entirely); the cap is shaped so that my dog can comfortably fit her snout and drink. The design makes it easy to pour back what she doesn't drink into the bottle. Cute color, a nice sturdy aluminum. Good buy!",5
Nice Poop Bags!  No longer need a scoop!,5
Bought 2 of these. They are ao easy to use. Dogs don't seem bothered by them and it is great seeing them at night. The light is bright! Love that they are rechargable.,5
My 2 cats love these. Good price in comparison to other pet suppliers.,5
"I've had this Cat Tree for over two years. I was able to put it together by myself, with their tool included. This is the best investment I've made for my cats! They absolutely LOVE this tree. Both my cats are over 12 lbs each and there have been no problems at all. It's extremely sturdy and well made. If I purchase more cat towers or trees, I will only purchase Armarkat! Absolutely a 5 Star product!

Update 12/18/15:
Four years later and this tree is still going strong. I now have 3 cats. My newest is a Rughugger Munchkin that flies up an down the tree. All of my cats are strickly indoor and declawed. None of them have any problems and love it so much, I purchased a second Armarkat tree, which they also use and love. I put these together myself. These are very solid units. I'm very glad I went with Armarkat brand.",5
Awesome product!  Works as advertised and will continue to buy from Amazon,5
"Great product, dogs love it!!!!!",5
"Dog likes it. Smells good, and seems to work great. Soft fur and no dry skin.",4
"first for the human side: easy open cans, low odor, solid food comes out of the can easy. Dog side:  Goober has been a special diet since being extremely sick. She had a bacteria infection from the dog food we allow in the market from China.  She has been eating refrigerated dog food from the grocery store.  My last bags had mold, not too fresh huh.  For the last month we have tried every food on the market.  This is the winner.  She is a huge mixed hound dog, but I bought the little cans for a test.  2 cans at first, and she tipped over her bowl looking for more.  2 more cans.  I can not express how great it feels not to throw away your money for food the dog won't eat and find something grain free at the same time.

Edit: spelling issues",5
The cat never leaves it in the winter. She even demands we move the food dish to her. Queen kitty loves it. Very easy to wash. Even with cat barf! Unzip and wash or vacuum as needed. It maintains heat well and we haven't had any electrical worries.,5
"I love this collar, it is very bright and made very well. It is double the thickness of all my dog's other collars and looks great on her.",5
I hide foraging treats all over this thing. Hes been hanging out on it and swinging,5
"I have 4 cats and one of them is a picky eater.  Since cats are obligate carnivores, they must eat meat.  This particular food is pretty much flaked fish and they love it!  I will most likely be buying more of this since I can't find this handy 18 pack in stores anymore.  Individual cans - yes, super convenient 18 pack - no.  Hooray convenience!",5
"Purchased this to prevent my 20lb french bulldog from getting sunburnt.  Ordered a medium.  It's snug, but fits well and so far no issues.",5
cat loves it.,5
Thanks!!!,5
My dog looks almost exactly like the dog in the picture and this mussel was too big. It fit perfect around her neck (with some adjustment) and the  circumference was right. But the length of the mussel part was too long. I ended up taking a pair of scissors to it and trimming off a good 1/2 inch. I then used a lighter to melt the end so it doesnt fray. It fits well now!,3
These are excellent clips. Very convenient and easy to switch from collar to collar. They are strong. I wish I would've got these years ago.,5
"The dogs LOVE this stuff.  It makes a big difference in their energy, coats and poop.  Would definitely recommend!",5
This play pe arrived on time. I have been using for over a month and it is working great.  As others have said if you have an active puppy you will need to close the top of the play so he/she doesn't knock it over to get out,5
Easy to us and a great product!  Will Definitely order again!,5
"Soft and nice looking but it was thin and never stopped shedding, even after a couple of wash and dry cycles.",1
Excellent product just received yesterday started using on my dog with commands for her to learn big difference in her obedience already,5
Nice product.  Keeps the water cold for a few hours.  but weirdly i think my dog prefers his water at room temperature.  I would still recomend and it would proably be good to keep canned food fresh for longer.,4
"My cat loved it, but I didn't know it had animal by-products... Probably won't purchase again.",4
"I bought this for my cat as he hardly drank from his bulky, 3-liter  waterer, which provides water for weeks! I guess the water gets stale and he likes it fresh, so I still had to place an additional bowl with fresh water that I change every other day. This waterer is a nice color, and the bottle screws on which makes it easy to refill and set up. There is a plastic mesh/strainer in the bowl, just between the mouth of the bottle and the actual bowl, to control the ""flow,"" I think. It's a nice size for small cats and dogs, doesn't tip over easily, and it doesn't take up any space either. However, my cat still prefers his fresh bowl of water, and only drinks from this waterer on occasion. Oh well, at least he won't run out, if I forget to refill his regular bowl!

Update, 7/4/08: The hole for the water to flow from the bottle to the dish is small and lower than the dish itself. Hence, it only automatically refills the dish when the water level is very low, and remains low (around 1/3 of the height of the dish) when refilled. I'd then have to tip the bottle forward a little to properly refill the dish to the rim. It's not a big deal, but if you're planning to be away for a few days without a pet sitter to check in on your pets, I'd recommend getting a larger/different waterer.",5
"My pets love these. They are very durable. My pet plays rough with toys. These toys are made to last, and are played with frequently for long periods of time",5
Our dog sleeps in this at night and it's PERFECT for travel also. Great quality and very functional.,5
Good brush!,5
Like that it is bright orange for visibility.,5
70lb dog in 100 degree weather... Seems to be helping,5
This bag is great. Its high quality compared to other bags I had. Its very roomy so my dog has plenty of room. I use it in the car.,5
"This jerky looks and smells good enough for humans.  The long, flat stick can be broken, which I don't do because that would sadden my dog too much.  She wants the whole piece.  Yes, it's good.  Super good.  So good, that when we were down to crumbs, I sprinkled them on her kibble and she finished off her bowl so that not a fleck remained.  Amazing, because she never licks that bowl clean, not normally anyway.",5
Dogs love them,5
work great,4
"This step is perfect for our 4 lb Maltese. He uses it about 200 times a day.
The unit was easy to assemble. The product blends well with our dark chocolate furniture.",5
"My girlfriend likes these a lot more than our other leash.  Since we've had this one, she's ordered a second one.  She has told me its because of the padded hand hold.  I do agree, it is much more comfortable.
Being adjustable is a great feature.  I can keep my dogs close without having to wrap the leash around my hand or arm.  Something very bad could happen with it wrapped around a limb.
It doesn't stretch, has yet to fray, and the handle is stitched well.  Our last leash came apart at the handle.
My only complaint is that the adjuster on our one leash snapped.  The leash still works at full length, but there's now a jagged edge.  Also it can no longer be adjusted.  I don't remember how it happened but I think it was a strong tug with the leash fully extended.  If you keep it somewhat retracted, this shouldn't be an issue.
Otherwise it's a strong purchase.  We have two 60ish+ lb Labrador retrievers and it works very well for both of them,",4
Very sturdy and durable. Seems like it will last forever. Both the cats and small dogs love it!,5
My two babies (mini dachshunds) love DentiStix; and I love them because they help keep their teeth in better shape!,5
Cheap quality. The cushion on the one I ordered had another dog's hair on it.,1
My dog love this toy!,5
"Bought this as had purchased Puppia before and really like; but no sizing information in inches to order correct size.
Halter is still best but PetSupermarket has their own brand if can catch in stock that is cheaper and almost as good.
She wears them our in a year anyway so we will buy there from now on.",3
This toy was very entertaining! He chases it around the house for hours!,4
"I purchased the ""drinkwell original pet fountain"" from Amazon four yrs ago. It worked well but was a monster to clean (nooks and crannies), and our rural well water meant it needed cleaning often.  Recently moved and brought it out of retirement...started right up and stays clean much longer with town water. The cats (2, large) love having it available again, and I love not being meowed at to come turn on the faucet fifteen times a day.
  I change the water everyday, being as the resident felines like to play in it.",4
Love this little power house!,5
"So far, works just as great as I would expect.  No complaints.",5
This is my birdseed of choice and I mix it with Pendingtons fruit and seed for wild birds and boy they come in droves.  Love it,5
"It took a few days for him to figure it out, but my kitty now loves this thing.",5
Helps my aging cats,5
quality food,5
"Good food, my cat loves it.  It's a little expensive, though.",5
The cat with allergies I got it for doesn't use it. My other cat rubs against it occasionally. Worth having it around for such a cheap price.,4
Great toy for cats of any age.,5
"Super easy to use, and my cat loves it. The thin tines get down and sweep away matted hair, and the push-button mechanism to clean it is incredibly handy. If your cat tolerates brushing at all, they'll love it.",5
Got it thanks,5
"After years of using Frontline, now in the toughest environment - Hawaii - I'm so grateful I've discovered this Cutter product.  It works immediately.  Overnight my two Corgis stopped scratching.  Frontline, the product the vets have put us all in bondage to, is soooo second rate and doesn't last two weeks in this area.  Bye Bye Frontline.  Whoo Whoo Cutter!!!!
And sooo affordable.  Finally!!!!",5
"I'll put it this way: My kitties enjoy watching ME spin the ball around the track. They will lay there watching the ball go 'round and 'round and when it stops they look at me like, ""well, get in there and spin that ball again"".  (And I usually do what they tell me to do.)  The scratch pad in the middle is well used, however.  For that reason alone, I feel it is worth the purchase since that means less attacks on my innocent furniture. The toy is a nice size and of substantial weight so it doesn't move all over the place when being used as either a toy or scratching pad. I do enjoy playing with it in the way I was directed to by my boys and they enjoy unleashing their claws on the scratch pad, so overall, a good purchase.",3
"Fits great on my small dog (24 lbs). Her puppy collar only went up to 12 inches, so this is a perfect fit at 10-14 inches. It is easier to walk her with this Martingale style collar since she will stop at the end of the leash when it starts to tighten up versus her normal collar where she just kept pulling and strangling herself without trying to stop.",5
This must be really tasty. I bought 2 bags for the new kitten joining our family this weekend. Decided to see what my 2 year old thinks of it...he loves it and given a choice between this or his dried chicken breast treats he goes for the kitten food. He has always eaten the Before Grain Salmon dry and I stocked up but we only have 2 bags left and am hoping this is a sign he will like their adult recipes too.,5
Our cats love it! Feathers do come out pretty easily but are able to be shoved back in.,4
"the crate is great but the tray is very cheaply made. My other kennels have thicker, more sturdy trays. I will order a metal tray to replace this.",3
cats love it,5
Product as described. Good Value.,5
"I have a maltese. He hates the grass, looks at me like what do you want me to do here. Lol whenever it rains or snows this is perfect. He goes straight to it without a problem. Have used everyday for about two months. I was worried about the smell and washing it. Smell is nothing more than a reg pee pad, so if you smelt that then you will this. However this doesn't leak or drip when you pick it up. I throw mine in the wash every night when I put him in his crate. Wash it and throw over shower door to dry. Haven't had any issue with washing machine smelling or clothes smelling. But I guess if you had a baby and used cloth diapers it would be the same? Just guessing there lol oh, and it still looks same as when I bought, holds up well.",5
"It's a great fogger, doing its job well. I purchased this over a year ago and had it running constantly ever since. The motor just now started to make whining and buzzing noises, louder than usual. I'm suspecting that it's beginning to wear out, but it's lasted much better than some of the other foggers I've used like the repti-fogger by zoomed which pooped out after 10 months of constant use. Yes, my equipment gets cleaned regularly so it's not the build up. Overall it's a great product for the value!",5
"Good coverage, fits well.  Does not vacuum easily so you have to take it out to wash it every time you want to clean it.",4
"My prior Chi had a Bungee Cat that she loved, kept it after she passed.  When I got my new pup, I didn't want her playing with it so purchased this one.  Well, it's a must have, she loves it and it's her favorite.",5
Sprouted well.  Didn't live long.,3
"I use this for my Satin rabbits that I am breeding - it seems to do a good job and they don't seem to mind it.  If I use it faithfully, I have a lot fewer problems with ingested hair.  This is much easier to use than a brush!!",5
The fellas seem to like it.,5
Our dog loves these kind of toys.,5
"Ive been trying out several different probiotics, so Ive seen a big variety of whats out there, as well as which brand does what best. There are several criteria points that should be met with a probiotic, so those are what I will discuss in this review.

Firstly, a good probiotic will have several different strains of good bacteria, which is what helps soothe upset stomachs, as well as working as a strengthener in several key areas. Huma.ne uses only three different strains. This isn't a case of more is better and actually some will warn against formulas with a lot of different strains, since the specific probiotic might not reach therapeutic levels. A handful or so of different strains should be good and likely won't crowd each other, since many probiotic strains prefer different parts of the dogs body. I definitely prefer around five so that my dogs are getting the most out of the probiotic, but three isn't bad.

Secondly, it is recommended that a dog get between 1-5 billion CFUs per day. Huma.nes probiotic gives 500 million (pre-packaging) per treat. My dogs are the medium dog size so they get three treats a day, which means they are getting 1.5 billion (or a little less due to some deactivating after packaging). Thats a decent amount, but again I prefer a little more just to offset the possibility that some would die off.

I do like the added calcium benefit, as well as this product being wheat and corn free. I cant comment on seeing a change in bowel processes, since my dogs were already on probiotics before I tried this out, but I haven't noticed any changes in an adverse nature either. I think this product hits the marks on what it needs to be, even if I would prefer a little more. It definitely is a lot better than some other products Ive seen. I would recommend this to others.

I received this product for free or at a discount in return for an honest review. Please note that I am not a dog nutrition expert and wrote this review due to my own knowledge and online research.",4
Good price and loved by my cats.,5
"Great. Long lasting, my dog loves it.",5
I have a large black lab and this black rolled collar looks great and provide a comfortable fit.  I have purchased Hamilton collars for all my dogs and the collars outlive some of dogs I had for 16 years.,5
My bed is extremely tall...the staircase is Perfection.  My small dog loves it and my medium sized dog is finally able to make it on the bed without assistance.  I can not see a big dog using it...but you never know...every dog is different.  This set of stairs works perfectly for my home!,5
One of my dogs died fro pythiosis this year so I did some research and decided this product would be both great for skin allergy issues and GI protection. My dogs are getting nice shiny coats and my newly adopted pound puppy with skin problems is regrowing hair where there was none.,5
"Having owned a lot of animals in my lifetime, I'm not new to retractable leashes. Many of the ones I've used in the past were of pretty poor quality and would either break after a small amount of use or the button would start jamming. The leads on the ones I've used in the past were also thin. This BonaFido Retractable Leash is much nicer! The lead is made of nylon so it feels similar to your average dog leash and the clasp is somewhat small (which is useful for my dog since he's only 5 lbs). I can't say how well this leash will hold up to a large dog who might have a lot of strength, but it works well for my little guy who's a puller. This leash is also pretty lightweight considering that it's retractable and it has a good grip to the handle.

Most of all, I love the colors offered and that it includes a waste bag holder, which is already loaded with bags. The e-books included with this leash are useful as well, especially for those who are new to owning a dog. Overall, the only negative thing I can say about this leash so far is that for some reason the BonaFido logo in the center of the leash is upside down on one side, yet right side up on the other, which looks a bit strange. I'm guessing that they're not typically like this. Either way, the leash serves its purpose well, so I'm happy with it! Please be advised that I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",5
As long as you have a lid on your tank to keep the heat in it is an ok heater. I am using it in my 5 gallon tank and it heats the water a little. Maybe it would work best on smaller tanks.,3
This product works fine. It does take away the urine odor.,5
Durable..,5
"My cats absolutaley love the dragonfly. I was afraid they could break it quickly but this dragonfly is very strong. My five cats love it and play with it. The color is bright and looks like a real one.
I really recommend it , you will probably have a lot of fun with your cats and this toy.",5
Love these. Comfy fit for the pups. I would recommend.,5
Not as good as I expected.,5
Great product,5
Works well..but only a day,4
"My dog is part Akita and part Lab, which means she has a serious winter coat on her. This particular brush will take out her undercoat and is so gentle while removing it that she sometimes falls asleep. Combined with another brush, I will get out all her excess fur to make her cooler for summer months and have her shed less.",5
"Be patient. My kitten had a hard time with this at the beginning and didn't use it. But as he got older and as it is his only way to get dry food during the day, he figured it out and now he's such a pro after 2 months I need a harder puzzle b/c it barely slows him down!",5
runs small,5
"Material felt cheap, and my dog got irritated skin using it. Returned.",1
"Watch out for  this Purina product.all  of my
dogs got diarrhea",1
My cat practically lives on this thing! She has completely stopped scratching the furniture. She seems to know that this is specially for her and uses it exclusively for scratching and for sleeping on.,5
Ok,3
"Very easy to wash, low speed on warm - put in dryer for 20 minutes and hang dry. Have big dogs and they still look like new.",5
"Kind of a pain to deal with, but so are kids. That's why I'm a dog mom.  

Would give 5 stars if they included more plastic thingies that keep the barrier from rattling. Right now I use wadded-up Kleenex because I'm classy like that.",4
The sizing is very hard to understand on both Amazon and the company's website. It was way too big when we received it.,3
The larger cans were a better deal! Still my cats' favorite food!,4
my african grey was not impressed with this  had to get another with seeds in it to mix for him to eat  he does not like carrots at all and it is loaded with carrots,3
ok but bits and pieces.,4
"I bought this one and the red  one same size for my 2 yellow labs.
They love it and carry it around with them and love chasing it.
It is fun for them on a hard surface and to chase out in the yard.",5
my snails love these. one month in and they look healthy and happy.  I have 2 in a 5 gallon and 1 in a 1.5 gallon,5
"Big fans here! I read a good write-up of this particular flavor --it's supposed to be lower in calories than other dog food/canned varieties and it's grain-free, which my dogs need. They love this stuff. I just pop the can and they come running...and there are 20 meatballs in every can so I can split it easily!",5
"This is very sturdy and well made. Sometimes it's just nice to have both of your hands available. I can use my phone and actually bring my coffee on morning walks now. I can hold an umbrella and my phone. I can stay dry with my umbrella and pick up dog poop. I'm a dog sitter and walk dogs often, this thing is going to come in handy. I also love the fact that you can unclip from waist and clip the dog to a pole if you're going to run inside to grab a coffee or pick up take out (something I do often). No more unhooking the dog to run the leash around a tree and back through the looped handle, risking the dog's safety. Since I'm a dog sitter, not all the dogs I watch are predictable. The colors are bright and as described. The waist is adjustable and comfortable. I will eventually buy one for small dogs as well. Great product that will get a lot of use by me.

*I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.",5
No so good,2
My Doxie loves this kind of puzzle! He loves to pull out the cups and find the treats underneath. Great rainy day activity.,5
"This collar is the best!  Wish I had bought it first.  I had an adjustable collar, but it would loosen up a little if my dog pulled on his leash very hard.  The last straw was when he ran after our other dog.  I pulled him back, and his collar just slipped off.  I was standing there with a leash, a collar, and no dog.  Luckily my husband was right there and grabbed the dog before he ran off.  When I went back in the house, I immediately ordered this collar.  It fits perfectly and does NOT loosen up.",5
The crate is great but came without the pin/spring door hardware. I was given a discount to purchase them myself but the sizing of pins made this a big pain!,3
"The holes in the wand are too fine, and did not produce very many bubbles. The bubbles it did produce were at each end of the wand.  I tried positioning it both, parallel and diagonally on the tank.  I ended up poking holes in the tube with a needle to get it to release bubbles.",1
2/4 of my cats like to chew on string and well they chewed it to death a little while after I got it. The squeak the mouse makes almost sounds like a real mouse. Kind of cheap but my cats liked it.,4
my parakeet loves it!,5
even tho this is more expensive it is worth it.. my puppy poops much less.  I tried switching her to something else and went back to this food.,5
"Cats love this, tear it up quickly! The price can't be beat for the fun they get out of it.",5
"My  dog LOVES these squeaky plushes! He will work away, worrying the little stuffed critters until he gets them out of the box. Then he likes to have me throw them. He chases and retrieves the items, though he doesn't yet have the ""bring it back to me"" part down. He really enjoys them, and I like having his toys be part of the Christmas decor!",5
Our toy Yorkie loves this ! It's very durable & has lots of spaces to stuff snacks ,5
"Works great in my small, 1 gallon, bird bath. I like the adjustable flow. It definitely attracts more birds.",5
Tags came in small Ziploc bag with ring to attach to collar.  When I first pulled it out of the bag the tags were already scratched up by the ring.  They coating scratches very easily.  Also one of my dogs has already lost her tag.  The ring was very cheap as well.  I am disappointed and would not reorder the tags or recommend them to a friend. However I asked to have dog's name on front and phone number on back and they did that. Shipment came in a timely manner and wording was correct on tags.,2
"After less than 6 months of use, my previous brush started falling apart. In hopes of finding something better, I searched the dog grooming articles and forums.  ""Chris Christensen"" was frequently mentioned as one of the best dog brushes on the market, well worth the extra cost, they said, so I ordered one.  When I opened up the box, my first thought was, ""It does look well built but I paid all that money just for this?""  However, as soon as I started using it on my Coton du Tulear (a small white dog in the Bichon family), I was amazed at how much smoother the polished antistatic pins moved through his hair and how there was almost no broken hair in the brush when I was finished.  My dog seems to like it a lot better.  It takes me half as long brush him.  Also, there isn't much reason to use an antistatic spray before brushing.  I wasn't sure which length brush to get.  The 27mm length is a little longer than necessary for my dog but I can't see any downside to the longer pins other than the slightly higher price.",5
While this product does not cure the problem it makes it easy to at least clean up my girls face under her left eye that leaks a lot...,5
"But, they do eat and play with these! They seem to like the dried fruit that is mixed in. I also watch them chewing up the pellets.
However, the plain Lafeber's Pellets? They ignore them. If they do touch them, all they do is throw them to the bottom of the cage.
So, I love these! Anything to mix up my 'keets diets. They otherwise hate everything but millet and seed.",5
"I use it correctly and it works great. We have 3 inside outside cats. Have had no fleas. A tick gets a ride in sometimes but it is disoriented , moving but, can't attach itself to me or the cats.",5
"I have a 2.5lb chi. It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be but it's as described. Fits her just right but if she were to move in to snuggle under, the blanket would probably move out of her way. Feels great though. Good quality.

Not a good match for any pet over a couple pounds.",4
My cats love the formula in Special 33.  Well worth the price.,5
As advertised.,5
Had to buy two - Mocha loves them (chocolate lab) - inside outside doesn't matter!,5
"With four cats I used to clean our two litter boxes twice a week and absolutely dreaded the ten minute ordeal that would ensue, not only that we were going through one economy sized bag of litter (think they were 25-30lb bags)once a week.. So after reading the reviews i bought this and I can say that all the positive feed back is nothing less than true. I empty this box daily as it only takes a minute and While I certainly don't look forward to emptying the omega box I don't really mind doing it either. WE've also cut back on litter use by about half. As a tip Getting a diaper genie and keeping it by the omega box will make emptying easier and keep the smelly used litter contained until garbage day, you can find them on craigslist dirt cheap, and just use garbage bags, not their pricey refills.

I bought the large one, because I have a heard of cats, and I'm glad I did, I can't imagine how small the regular size is after the screen is installed. The lid is a seafoam green and the base is greyish. Assembly is really easy and instructions aren't needed though they are included. the opening is large enough for my big male tabby to fit through and low enough for the 2 month old kittens to get in as well.
I'm not sure why so many people are upset with the clips...i thought they were just fine and considering the price I wasn't expecting clips of steel. Besides it being a bit large I can't think of a single con to this box. Buy it now! you won't regret it.

Update-July 2012- 10 months with Omega!
I'm still loving my Omega box! Since having it I've told almost anyone  I know who has cats about this box and the people who took my advice always get back to me and tell me how they'll never go back to a regular litter box again!  I have noticed a few cons since owning it one being that there is a ton of litter outside the opening from my cats going in and out-easily double what they used to track out with a regular box.
 The other being that my grandmother asked me to one of these for her, I had it delivered to my home so I could set it up for her. It arrived about a week ago. I think they're getting a little cheaper with the quality, there was bits of unfinished plastic stuck in certain parts and the drawer does not sit quite correctly or as nicely as mine does.  I guess they had to cut some corners in order to pay off the fancy iridescent logo that is now on the lid. It appears that it works just the same (as I showed her how to use it once I brought it over) but I'm a little disappointed with the inconsistent quality.",5
Perfect...love the smell...no more bath chasing...,5
"We usually just give the dogs the kids old comforters when they get new one's, but this time around I decided to order them their own blanket. First off, when I opened the package, the dogs had no way of knowing it was theirs....but somehow they knew. They jumped up on me, and followed me downstairs waiting to see where I was going to put it....funniest thing you have ever seen. Put it in their doggie bed, and they immediately snuggled up to it. It is still in one piece, although I have yet to wash it...but it is soft and the dog's love it so much, they have yet to use it as a ""tug-o-war"" object!",5
"I can't believe I waited so long to buy these. Best $20 I ever spent on my pup. He's a 70lb pit/lab mix with terrible grass allergies (I got size L). We've tried everything and managed to get it under control through an array of medical and natural remedies (grain free diet helps, coconut oil, but also antihistimines and an allergy medicine specially compounded for him after a blood test....having a dad who's a vet helps). I used to think dog boots were for prissy dogs, but once I got these, we'll never go back. Dogs are exposed to so much--harsh concrete, hot temperatures, dirty chemical runoff, and so much more. This has helped my dog reduce his itching and licking his paws, and I'll definitely be using them all year round. Thank you!!",5
Works awesome!,5
The toys are not exactly what it is pictured (though pretty close). There are a couple balls and white mouses and no catnip baggy. So far my cat loves all the items and plays with them all. good assortion of cat toys I would say.,5
"I highly recommend clicker training, and this is a good clicker. It's easy to hold. I put it on a coiled key chain so it's always on my wrist when with my horse.",5
"My dogs only get bathed with Earthbath. I love the scent of this one too. No itching, no strong smell once rinsed out, and most importantly it gets them clean!",5
"We recently rescued a lab mix and she is our first dog in 10 years.  I don't know if it is because we are much older since we had animals but we are much more focused on making our doggie happier.  Our children were home when we last had dogs and they tended to them.
The squirrel dude is one of only two it  treat items that have lived up to our expectations.  Not to mention our dog, she loves it and will play with it for over an hour.  It is really durable and touch.  Our dog is a strong chewer and it fills the bill perfectly.  Thanks so much",5
"I liked the idea behind this one.  My dogs, both pit mixes, really like the individual Nylabones and ""fight"" over possession of them.  I thought a double would help them with their friendly little tug-of-war matches.  In reality, though, they preferred the tired and true versions better.  It's not a bad product.  My dogs just weren't as interested.",4
"This is good in theory but I couldn't contain my puppy, I think it might be my bath tub but she kept pulling it off super easily! She probably weighs 20-25 pounds",3
"This product is a lifesaver! The company is awesome, great customer service, and a whole line of amazing products!",5
"Super large kennel! Easily assembled and does its job. Seems a little flimsy so if you have a dog that likes to chew on the kennel it might get damaged. It fits our  6 m/o golden retriever puppy and miniature poodle perfectly with toys and a large dog bed. Similar products run about $80 so it was a pleasure to find a good product for a super reasonable price. I would buy it again. I feel like as long as your dog doesnt like to destroy kennels, then it will last a long time. I would even feel comfortable keeping a cat in there short term is very roomy and the plastic bottom comes out for easy cleaning.",4
"I use it to help keep my elderly dog's appetite up, but it also seems to keep everything moving smoothly for her.",5
I don't care for the smell of this pet cologne at all. Smells like an old ladies perfume. Very floral but not in a good way. Not the clean fresh scent that I was expecting.,1
"My new kittens didn't like this food and didn't eat it at all for about a full 24 hours. Maybe they were just getting used to the new kind of food from the old owner who was feeding them regular cat food. They still don't eat alot of it considering. I think my girlfriend keeps filling them up on kitten treats. They eat it, but I can tell that they aren't really crazy for it. I guess I just bought this thinking that they would be fighting over it. I will continue buying it though since they both look really healthy. They do have worms currently too, so maybe thats what it is too. I will know more after we deworm them this next weekend.",3
Works fine.,5
First one broke on the first use but company was great with the return process & I received the replacement pretty quickly. Works GREAT!!!,5
Excited to set this one up tonight,5
My dog loves these. they last a while.,4
Dogs love them and it is a nice way to put healthy treats inside.,5
"So far, so great! No fleas, ticks, heartworm, etc. Use on all 3 of our small dogs (2 chihuahuas and a French Bulldog). They play in the field by our house and don't bring unwanted hitchhikers back with them. Plus, my vet recommends it",5
I have purchased a few of these over the years to give as gifts and everyone loves them.  They are very easy to take care of and truly beautiful.  The shrimp usually live about 2-3 years but I have seen one where the shrimp reproduced and its around 4 years old.,5
"The item was as described and arrived on time without any problems! I would definitely recommend this product and this seller! I bought this for my sisters 100 pound lab/Shepard mix, but, my 13 pound miniature dachshund ended up stealing it and running around the house with it ... And then he managed to bring it up to our bedroom and putting it with his pile of toys!! Both dogs really loved it, not to mention they went crazy when it squeaked!! I think this size is great for larger dogs, but, I also think its great for the smaller dogs that think they're bigger than they really are! I love Kong toys!!",5
Arrived quickly.  Cats like it. Metal container keeps it fresh.,5
cats do well on this.,5
"UPDATED
We adopted a rescue dog in April via Soi Dog and Posh Pets Rescue. Our Juniper was a street dog in northern Thailand, who was rescued from unspeakable conditions in the illegal Thai dog meat trade.

She is skittish and very sensitive to noise. We live in lower Manhattan. Enough said.

First we tried a martingale collar, but she pulls so much that she lost all of the fur on her neck. Then we tried a standard step-in harness, which was better, but she still pulled a lot - enough so that the fur on her chest was rubbed off in the harness pattern. Our trainer recommended the Easy Walk.

While skeptical, I ordered one and received it the next day. Our walks are completely different.

Now Juniper walks next to me, is very calm, and doesn't frantically race ahead. The leash, even when short, is generally loose. Even better, her walking radius is slowly expanding, which in NYC requires crossing some big streets. She still gets nervous, but not as often or as intensely.

After just two days, hubby and I are convinced at the efficacy of the Easy Walk harness. The difference in Juniper is remarkable!

**After a couple of weeks she had chafing and rubbing on her chest/shoulders and her armpits. First we adjusted, then changed size, and then went for the Deluxe.

None have been perfect, so hubby just ordered one from Walk Your Dog with Love and we will see!",3
Only thing that actually helps my dogs breath and teeth.,5
I've been buying these for years! This deal is cheaper than pet food suppliers and if you have Prime - even better. My dogs get two a day.. once after their morning walk and then after their late walk. My kids love them! And they love the variety even better.,5
Works for the catit BUT it's not the actual replacement for the flower catit,5
Best stuff out there period,5
"I got this ""Used like new"" and was horrified to realize some dog's urine was in the tray!! I washed it, but fricking gross!  The kennel was ok, a little short for it's  width,  but fine.",2
my dog doesn't care for these.  would not buy again,2
I bought this for my Belgian Malinois who had an annoying habit of barking incessantly at 5 AM sharp every morning. It worked like a charm and now I don`t have to worry about the constant 5 AM wake up calls! Safe and effective. Very well constructed and has concise instructions. The collar can adjust to fit fairly small to very large dogs. Even fits well around my 15 lb Cavalier King Charles.,5
"It's cat litter.  It clumps.

Actually, it's less dusty than others - only time I have an issue with it is when I'm dumping the bucket into an empty litterbox.  It's not bad then, just  some.  I don't have any problems with clumps not forming.  So wayhey, we happy.",5
"We recently added a geriatric cat with some chronic digestive issues to our household.

Without being indelicate, let's just say that sometimes his solid leavings in the litter box aren't exactly solid...and don't exactly make it all the way to the litter box.

We keep a supply of these arrayed *around* the litter box, which helps reduce the clean-up workload following one of his ""episodes"".

The large size increases the chances that his leave-behinds will end up in the pad and not on the floor. Very absorbent, and a good alternative to the soiling we'd otherwise face on the floor.",5
my dogs are very happy with this food!,4
"Good quality product, but runs very small.  My two 6&1/2 pound chihuahuas wear size Medium; size Small was too small - I could barely close the velcro adjustable section around their chests!  Ordered Mediums for both, and this size fits very well.  It is difficult to find vests/harnesses that fit small breeds correctly, but this product is well worth the money for the health and safety of my two little ones.",5
My very spoiled kitties love this.  I've been having trouble finding it in a big batch.  Very convenient and fresh.,5
"I was hoping for relief for my dog, but no change in her road trip symptoms unfortunately.",1
Good,5
"I have an old farm house with a kitchen leading into a pantry which leads out doors. I put this double door kit plus the matching telescoping through wall kit through the kitchen wall into the pantry. Then I used a different single door kit through the pantry door to outside. it worked great. I ended up buying a little longer threaded rods in place of the long screws maybe because the wall was too thick. It went through plaster, wood lathe, sideboard, then stucco reinforced with wire lathe. The double doors stay shut almost all the time, even when windy outside. Two Minnesota wnters so far and still on the original flaps even though used several times each day by energetic cattle dog.",5
Great bowl! Easy to clean!,5
"I have a very picky 13-year old German Shepherd who refuses to swallow his pills, and these are PERFECT! All 4 of my dogs love the taste of the chicken flavor, and I'm so happy not to have to wrap their pills in cheese. Please don't ever discontinue these - Awesome product and the dogs give them two thumbs up!",5
Very nice colar very happy,5
My cat loves it! Keeps her occupied! She even uses the center scratching pad. A winner!,5
Our cats love it and it's MUCH less expensive & way taller than the ones we saw in pet stores. We wanted to get one that's really tall & this one is perfect.,5
"dog had it tore apart in no time. don't really blame maker totally, but better quality materials could be used. bought it on sale and you get what you pay for.",3
Purchased this for my budgies to give them a better diet. Put a small amount in some unsweetened applesauce to get them to try it.,5
Does the job when needed.,3
great price,5
I love the concept but the zipper pull on the outer cover came off and disappeared the first time I washed it-grrrrr,2
"These are generally a good set of bells, with many snaps at various places so you can adjust the overall length as well as go around various doorknobs/latches/items.",4
"Used for my dogs graduation from
Physical rehabilitation , this graduation cap stayed level & on his his head . Well done!",5
My boys just love them and this is well worth the money,5
"Excellent quality materials and construction, but it is too stiff and not soft to the touch.",5
"I've owned several larger Marineland power filters and my ancient made in USA models worked reliably for 10 years or more. The wee Penguin 100 is a based on a similar design but during the past 2 years I've gone through three of them on my 10 gallon tank. They're fussy devices and need to be kept reasonably clean, especially the impeller assembly. As long as you use fresh filters and keep the impeller and pipes clean, it does a great job keeping the water clear: colored medication, algae scrub downs, etc., are cleared from the water within an hour.

Filters are expensive, especially at your local pet store. My larger Marineland units could use reusable filter frames. No such luck with the small filters used in the Penguin 100. However, these filters easily last a month and, if bought in 6-packs at Amazon are less than $2 each. Also, the less expensive AquaTech #1 filter cartridges fit this machine.

THE GOTCHA: My first Penguin 100 bought the farm after less than 2 years and my second unit died after only 6 months. So I bought a third one from Amazon and it suffered intermittent motor shutdowns within the first week of owner ship! So I'm done with Marineland and switched to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AquaClear-50-Power-Filter-110-V-UL-Listed-Includes-AquaClear-50-Carbon-AquaClear-50-Foam-AquaClear-50-BioMax/dp/B000260FUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AquaClear 50 Power Filter - 110 V, UL Listed (Includes AquaClear 50 Carbon, AquaClear 50 Foam & AquaClear 50 BioMax</a>. No problems with the AquaClear after  six months and it even restarts after power blinks!

When this thing works, it's a great filter for a small tank: cleans well, quiet and easy filter changes. The gotchas are pricy filters and serious reliability issues.",1
I bought these for my pet rats. I thought they we're going to be like food pretzels. They are just wood sticks and they did not touch them,1
"My dog has a very sensitive stomach. If he goes too long between feedings, eats anything different, or if the wind blows in a different direction... he will have tummy troubles (vomiting, gurgling, skipped meals, etc.). The vet put him on pepcid which seemed to help, but I had keeping him on medication long term. We tried one of these at bed time every night and they work great! Only time he has had trouble is one night when we forgot! :( So happy we found these!",5
"I am FURIOUS to have spent over $200 for this item.  Aside from the fact that it was not that easy to put together, and the ""included"" air pump is useless, I am beyond angry over the fact that when I took my 15 pound shih tzu for a walk/run with it, the right rear wheel kept coming off the axle... the stroller nearly veered off into traffic.  In addition, other writers wrote about how the stroller smelled horrible - I also had to let it ""off gas"" for a few days before putting my dog into it.  I tried to fix the wheel, to no avail.

One good thing though:  I'm glad I bought this through Amazon because returning the item was pretty easy and I got an immediate refund.",1
"I would have gave it 5 stars but the picture shows the color wrong. Mine showed up a very light green but the quality is excellent.

UPDATE* It's been on dog for months now still looks like new..except dirty..which helps the color look darker.
UPDATE* 5 years still holding up great!
UPDATE* 6 years and starting to finally show wear. Still in very good condition.",4
"My older dog has neck pain, and this made it possible to still use a leash for walks.  He doesn't mind it, and it appears comfortable.",5
This mat was an excellent purchase for my cat as I have to place her bowl up on a shelf so the dogs cant eat it and it kept sliding off and smashing below.  This works perfectly for the space I needed and keeps her bowl in place.  I was a little worried about the scent as was mentioned in another review but it passed my sniffer (and I have an acute sense of smell!).  Great buy for the price!,5
"I've been using this for my 6"" yellow bellied slider for about a month now, and she absolutely loves it.  The ramp could be a little longer, and you have to cover up the open part of the tank (mine would pull herself up and out if I didn't have it covered), but overall I highly recommend this tank topper.  I've tried the floating docks and always had to return them because she'd sink them - but this gives her so much more room to swim around, and she fits in the basking area with room to spare.  It fits my 20 gallon tank perfectly. Completely worth the money.",5
dogs love these and they last a long time !,5
Keeps my pup clean and no odor associated with it,4
"Kennel has nice features, although it is darker than the photo shows and would get hotter if left in sunlight. Reviews reporting dogs chewing through the fabric should be dismissed; it's the owners' fault, not the kennel's (or the dog's!). You'll also need to provide your own bed and/or cushion before you can use this, however.",5
"Pup loves it. Good quality, at least for a chihuahua ",5
"Cat disliked it,it died soon after it grew",1
"OMG most durable ball, and has outlived countless! My dogs destroy balls and this has lasted many months!",5
"Cats wouldn't eat any of the four flavors except the beef, and at that point only out of desperation (I think). Previously ate Fancy Feast, Pro Plan, and Science Diet (chunks in gravy), but they would not touch this stuff. My cat actually kept scratching above the food like he was trying to cover it up in the litter box.

I always thought Whiskas (and Friskies) were low quality, but I thought maybe I was just being a brand snob. Maybe so, but either I was right about the quality, or my cats learned how to read and they're brand snobs, too. In all fairness, this is probably fine if this is the first food you give your cat, but I guess mine are spoiled.

Also, Amazon wouldn't allow me to return this even though I bought it through them. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought a whole case. Live and learn, I guess.",1
"My cat didn't like this, it made the water gross, and the grass didn't grow very well anyway.",2
"My dog LOVES this toy! I got this and a regular rope toy (the kind with frayed ends) when the cat peed on all of the toys in the dog's toybox (evil cat!). She is an aggressive chewer, and has earned the nickname ""Captain Destructo"" because she rips everything to shreds in seconds (flimsy rubber balls, stuffed toys, etc.). In a few minutes she was able to find the weak spot in the toy and pull out an end that was tucked in, but after a month and a half, she is still working on unbraiding the toy. She hasn't even touched the other rope toy, which used to be her favorite kind. Overall, I'd say it was a great purchase, and I'll be getting another when this one is too tattered.",5
"I have raised two dogs almost exclusively on Purina Pro Plan. They both never seem to get tired of it. They are active, at a healthy weight, smart, and never sick. The focus, sport, and savor lines are all great fuel for healthy dogs.",5
"Only use tall sided boxes like this to prevent accidents.  This shiny surface keeps the clumping litter from sticking and makes clean up quick and easy.  I like Cat's Pride light weight, no dust, lightweight.  Try and use unscented litter for your kitty's sensitive nose.  A clean box has no odor anyway.  Enjoy.",5
Just what I needed.,5
"Just got this today! So much better than the cone of shame! My puppy is a border collie about 22"" from had to tail and 30lbs. I got a large long and it fits good!",5
I really love this collar! So cute.,5
a good buy for the money. Love the sizee,5
My younger cat loves it wish I didn't have move it but she likes it,4
"I bought this for my elderly mini rex rabbit so I could transport him to the vet for some minor medical treatments. The carrier arrived fully assembled and comes with a removable food/water dish. The top part has a little storage unit and it also comes with some stickers to put your pet's name on. I think this carrier is a great deal. It's sturdy, easy to carry and has plenty of ventilation. I just put a little blanket inside of it before I put my bunny in to keep him comfortable and from slipping around in it. I think this carrier would also be great for chinchillas, a ferret, or small cat.",5
"Our Hamster uses her bath, she mostly digs in it.... I guess she flops around in it too but she is a dwarf and so she fits in there pretty well but doesn't have to much space.",4
I have had 2 of these less than a year and the cot material started to fall apart. I would not purchase this again. It is a waste of money,1
I get so many compliments when out walking my girls with their pretty pink hankies.,5
Fast shipping. Sturdy. I use it for the dog to potty indoors as a super large washable mat.,5
I love it but for some odd reason my dog (a Bichon Frise) refused to use it even though I I should him a few times how to use it.,5
"Works well, very easy to use, and seriously, my litter trash can is no longer smelly as before.  Highly recommended.",5
Looks great.....but the turn screws are so cheap and pop out constantly,3
"All three cats seem to enjoy it.  While it's expensive for a piece of wire and rolled paper, it's less expensive than other toys that may hit or miss.  This definitely went over better than some of the more expensive toys.",5
"Nice vest, well made, and the fit is adjustable. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a more fitted, durable harness.",5
"If your dog has strong teeth (regardless of size), don't get. The plastic isn't edible. I got this as one of my puppies gifts for Christmas and he ruined it within 10 minutes.",3
I have had two poodles for many years and they both have loved these.,5
Have to say Ms. Priss is not liking this brand as well. My Siamese does not have to much hairball problems. She's actually never thrown one up either until this food. I think I will donate this to the wild cats running around and find something a little better for her digestion.,3
"Chicken is not a favorite for this kitty, though adding Instinct's Raw Mixer is a winner.  Would like it best if they used BPA free cans.",3
OKAY product. The seam where the head attaches to the braided ring is weak and rips easily. The ring itself is of solid construction and will likely last a long time.,3
Neither of my dogs will touch it. Went to do a return and the cost of returning is as much as the product was so I would get nothing back. Make sure you want it.,1
"It was better quality than I expected. My little Chihuahua LilMan loves the softness, and the thickness, great color too.",5
You get what you pay for.,3
My puppy LOVES this bone. It does not break apart and is not messy after the first few minutes of licking.,5
"Recommended by a vet-tech for use around a stressed out cat that eliminates in inappropriate places, this product seems to help. We had two instances, wherein the cat still used a throw rug for her toilet, but it seems to have aleviated the problem for the most part.",4
Small but I still love it,4
No good for dogs,2
"Miss Helen loves them, so I would say they're yummy. It sure freshens her breath.",5
Very nice!  One of my cats likes to use it for a bed!,5
"I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.
Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they won't touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.",1
"Although I'm sure this is a great food for dog, I have 2 extremely
picky furry kids and they wouldn't even try a bite of this food.",3
Love the leash.  We got the leash and matching collar for our Blue Heeler puppy Harlee.  She has gotten compliments on the colors and polks dots at the vets office.  The purple is just really pretty.  The length is good and the hook works flawlessly.,5
"Great price! Skip petco and petsmart with their overpriced cage. This is a great quality cage and sturdy. The double doors gives you an option of which door to use which is great when your finding a place for it. If you'll be using this as closed cage it will be easy to clean, no maintenance needed. I also bought the Amazon basics padded pet booster bed and it fit perfectly, affordable price also.",5
Item came exactly as pictured and seems to work great. The fish seem happy too. Easy to measure doses in the cap.,5
Too expensive for just 20lb. went back with the original formula 40lb Bag. Though there were less dusting it did nothing for odor. Need to clean entire thing weekly vs 30 Days due to poor smell control. I got the marineland ammonia neutralizing zeolite blend to mix with litter & solved the odor problem.,1
This tower is sturdy.  Arrived in a big box. Only had to assemble top tier.  3 bolts already in place on tier.  I just needed a drill or screwdriver.  2 minutes and I was done.  Awesome.  My cat weighs 12 pounds and she's comfortable.,5
"Bought this mid-December and after a couple of weeks of normal wear during walks and runs, the black lining around the neck hole completely unraveled. Having to purchase a new harness already since this one is not sturdy.",1
"What can I say about tubing, it was very flexible and worked well for our aquarium.",5
I've used Advantage II in my cats for long time. Excellent product.,5
"I have 3 Shih Tzus that I love dearly and am happy to report the great results with Whimzees.  I buy the small toothbrush ones for my 2 younger pups and 1 extra small bag for my elderly Shih Tzu ! The XS Whimzees are more easily chewed by my oldest and the small are perfect for my younger pups. LOL  !!!  The only problem I ever have with the Whimzees is if I run out
before the next delivery.  Love  the Whimzees !!!",5
Fits very well and works wonderfully! Very good quality and beautiful color.,5
"I have a yellow lab and the blue color of the collar really pops on him. Seems very strong and good quality as well,for cheap! Very impressed!",5
"My dog is a big Chesapeake Bay Retriever, and if you know anything about dog breeds you'll know that brushing her teeth is a task to be dreaded.  However, this brush (with a liberal application of poultry flavored toothpaste) reaches her back teeth easily and she doesn't give me a bit of a problem.  Makes a tough job easy.",5
"I think these are expensive, but my dog loves them. And it eases my mind to know that they are not from China.",5
Great bowls... but they are only 1 quart not the claimed 2 quart size. I have a 2 quart one already for my dogs water bowl and was quite surprised when I opened the package and found that the 2 I ordered were half the size and only 1 quart. Didn't have any time to send back because the rabbits were in their new pen and needed these heavy bowls so that they couldn't keep flipping them and wasting all their food and water. I would have given a 5  rating if they had not lied about the size. They are great bowls.,2
Love these bowls. They have a snug fit.,5
Finally an really quiet and efficient air pump! Im getting a second one!,5
"This works! Our beagle was full of fleas after a long run in the woods. Turns out we forgot to give him the tablet. They all disappeared after he ate the tablet. We'd rather not feed the dog any chemicals, but perhaps this is better than him being bit by fleas and ticks.",5
Great addition to the cage for extra space and areas for the cats to hang out. Easily moved as conditions require.,5
Great diet for ferrets,5
This is a great pet door.  It fit the hole left by my previous door which finally wore out.  It was also an Ideal brand door.  I like the ease with which my dogs & cat can go in and out and they can see through the clear door.  The magnet works well to keep heat or cold in the house.  I highly recommend this door to anyone,5
"Kong is a great brand, but these did not hold up longer than about 10 min.",1
My cat can play with these for hours on end. Very entertaining to her!,5
nice bowls. really heavy and sturdy.,5
"I have tried many different brands of bully sticks and I expected these to be the same as all the others I have tried.  Let me explain:  We have all large dogs - 75 lbs plus. It is extremely hard to find a chew that will last longer than a minutes.  These bully sticks are as advertised:  they are  definitely thicker than any other bully stick I purchased previously.  They also don't smell too bad and of course the dogs love that smell.  I handed these out and set a timer.  My biggest chewer, my Lab Farley, took 15 minutes to chew his.  Finally success!  The rest of the dogs came in around 20 minutes. If you are looking for a bully stick that will satisfy your biggest chewer, look no further. These bully sticks are also a great buy for the price.  I have set up a subscribe and save for these bully sticks every month to save more money. The bottom line is these bully sticks are a quality treat at great price.",5
My dog loves these.,5
"This is one of the simplest, most ingenious aquarium supplies I own. Every time I look at it, it makes me wonder why I hadn't thought of the concept; it seems like something I would have. xD I found it a couple of years ago at one specific fish store, and haven't seen it any other shop or catalog before or since. Which is strange, considering how good it is. My regular handled algae scraper is a pain; of course you get wet trying to reach below a certain point of my vertical 55-gallon tank. Plus, for some unfathomable reason, the handle is hollow, which means it fills with water, and then spills it all over. This product scrapes algae well, but I've never had a problem with it scratching my glass (obviously, according to others, it's not good for acrylic tanks...unfortunately. Hopefully they'll come out with one designed for those.)

My only complaint about the thing is that it needs a stronger magnet. It would be good to be able to move it more quickly in any direction without the inside piece floating away, in which case you've got to quickly try to attract it back with the outside half, or else have to manually drag it back to the side to reconnect them before the filter current carries the scraper half off again. Also, since my tank is vertical and hexagonal in shape (an extremely inconvenient style as far as cleaning goes, but my parents bought it when I was very little and hadn't really thought of that) and can't be walked completely around, there are six corners--and you need to move carefully from one glass panel to another. Corners, gravel, objects--they can all cause it to separate. Especially in mine, because again, the parts towards the back and next to our walls can be hard to reach.

The only other downside would be if you had something on the outside of the glass that would need to be removed in order to use it. Also, it's obviously only good for cleaning the glass--but you wouldn't really expect it to be able to do anything else in the aquarium!

But on the whole, I'm really happy with the little thing. Just plop it in, drag it across the glass, take it out, dry it, put it away! And I have the small Mag-Float (it was the only size available in the store), which will work perfectly on any size aquarium.",4
great bows; very colorful,5
"perfect size for my cat.  I put it up on a shelf in my closet as she loves to go in there and sleep when I leave for the day.  Once she saw this bed, she immedicately curled up in it.",5
"These are my puppy's favorite treats.  When I offer it to him, he sniffs it, then gently takes it from me and finds a comfy spot to enjoy his ""goody"".  It's just too cute for words. So, Thank you!!",5
"I've bought biodegradable bags before that have been paper thin and difficult to separate.  I didn't have that issue AT ALL with these bags.  I'm definitely happy with the effectiveness, the fact that they are eco friendly, unscented, sturdy, a good size, affordable and come in such a large quantity.  Will definitely purchase again.",5
This is a wonderful collar.  I have never even needed to use anything but the vibrate.  I didn't have to use it more than a few weeks but well worth the money.  My dog now understands when I say something I mean it.,5
these do not work in the furbo as previous reviews stated.,1
My dog won't use it.maybe it's only for a cat.,3
Such a cute item- our dog loves it! We love watching him okay with this toy,5
cute but too small no other size available and it was not cost effective to return.,4
"Scaredy asked about my review but I don't know how to get to them.  These scissors are what I needed but when I tried to trim my dogs foot hair they just pushed the fur away from the blade and it was almost impossible to keep her still and get all the hairs I needed to cut and even trying to cut away threads on a small rug I had to grab them and saw away trying to get the blades to get a hold on them.  I just wanted a sharp, rounded tip scissors but these are a disappointment.  CAD

This previous review was picked up by Scaredy Cut and they informed me that they were sending another scissors to replace the ones that were not working well and I was surprised.  I did receive the new scissors and they work perfectly and are sharp.  I realize these things happen sometimes but I was amazed that the company cared so much as to immediately replace them. These work well on trimming my little dogs foot fur and trimming other areas. It makes a world of difference not only in the new scissors but the fact that a company could care about how the product performed. CAD",5
"Fast delivery, our Lucy loves the bites.  We like no grain products because we feel that the other is not healthy for her.",5
My two dogs love this Pup-peroni. Great treat and I like that it is 90% fat free. This size bag last us for a long time.,5
I love this tubing.  A great buy when purchased as an Add-On item.,5
"Cats have ignored it.  Even with treats instead of regular food and lots of encouragement.  It's true, they want the box it came in more than the product itself.",2
"Everything fits well; the neck and arm holes are roomy and comfortable. I took it off of him and he picked it up and brought it back to me because he wanted it back on lol. He's very comfortable and warm in it, I just wish it was long enough to cover his back. Once he wears it for a while, it rides up a lot and looks more like a tiny vest lol. It doesn't reach his belly on the other side either.",4
"This Absorbs Nada, Total waste to even conceder using this for a cat.",1
This pet pen has worked out great just wish it was a little easier to clean my puppy is still have night accidents,5
"This product works.  I have tried others and had no luck.  I recommend Advantage II to all cat owners.  We are located in South Florida and sometimes the fleas can be horrible, as my two outdoor kitties found out earlier this year.  After trying many products, this finally did the trick; no fleas or eggs for at least 28 days.  Ottis and Pepe say thank you to the Bayer People for making summer much more enjoyable.",5
Great product. One of the best dog foods made.,5
"I love this treat ball, however, do not bother putting the treat disks in the outer slots as shown in the picture.  Your smart dog will chomp them right out and eat them promptly.  If you put the treat disk, or any type of treat, really, in the MIDDLE compartment...  this will keep your dog entertained for HOURS AND HOURS. My German Shepherd chewed at this for many hours, licking and chewing until he finally gave up exhausted and sleeping with the ball still in his paws.  The  Bernese Mtn Dog got hold of a Medium size ball (he should have a large) and managed to rip it apart to get to the inner area filled with treats. One expensive dog ball, destroyed. However, this was not the right size for him, so perhaps that's why. The Coton de Tulears that I gave the small size ball to have still not finished the treat. They've been licking and chewing for 2 days now. So overall, I love this product, as long as you DON'T use it the way it's shown!  :)",5
"Our golden loves playing catch with this frisbee.  I am afraid it won't hold up very well if he lays down and starts chewing on it I am sure he will ruin it.  We already have a few marks in it.  We are not letting him have it in his toy box.  It is a little heavy.  It is not a pool or beach toys as it sinks.  He likes to catch it in his mouth so we are only throwing it short distances.  Because its soft and flexible, it is easy for him to catch and if he misses, no big deal, bounces off of him.

UPDATE 1 month later, the frisbee has several tears on the sides, its a month old.  Not happy with this kong purchase, I thought their toys were more durable.  They are more pricey than other brands so u expect it to hold up better than cheaper priced items.  Disappointing.  But it is one of his favorite toys because it is so soft and chewy.",2
ok,5
My little pom-a-poo has a very delicate neck area and this harness prevents her from choking. It spreads out the pressure from holding the leash and keeps it off of the sensitive area in her neck.,5
"So very cute,TY.Jude",5
First thing to EVER work for my speed eater.  Strong suction cup.  Had it months and it's still going strong.  It slows him down to like 8 minutes...which it used to be about a minute.,5
It's a bumper.  It works. Arrived on time. Good.,5
"My dog gives it a two paws up!  She's crazy about these all natural jerky treats.  She's even learned the words ""Chicken Jerky"".",5
" i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not influenced by anyone in any way.

These bowls really come in handy especially when you have a dog that likes to eat the plastic ones. I had put down our hard plastic bowl and our dog wanted to chew on it. Spilled water every where. So, we now have to get these types of bowls. It's anti-slip, durable and made good. This one is a little shallow. Not as much room for water, like our other one is, but would make a good food bowl for small to medium size dog.

Stainless steal is a good for dog bowls, mainly because they are rust resistant. We keep a bowl outside in the back yard for when our dogs go outside to play. We had one last year that rusted. These don't.

  Great for any size dog or cat even.

  CLEANING: hand wash or dishwasher safe

 OVERALL: It's a great quality bowl and I do recommend this bowl.  As for affordability, I would like to have seen 2 bowls for the price, so I could having a matching pair. I think the price would be almost right for a pair, not just one.",4
Perfect for my little 5 lb. Yorkies.  The comb is sturdy and fits well in your hand.,5
Pussy didn't like them... :(,1
"Not working. I bought to help with the prescribe ""prion"" She was receiving two prions a day and no leakage. I wanted to sub this pill with one of the prions, I did this and she started leaking again. I would give prion at morning and this pill at evening in place of the prion. I thought it would help with liver or other effects. Also, she will not take the pill direct. I have to mix with her meal. I bought two bottles due to all the good reviews. Guess I was fooled. I will continue to give for a while to see if anything changes. One review say it took two weeks to work. I did not think that this would be the case for me since I am still giving her prescription, just cut back.",1
These tiny treats are the perfect size for a treat ball or a puzzle toy.  Even my Chi can get it on the play now that we have treats he can eat as well!,5
This product would have been just fine if it wasn't that my German Shepard chewed this up in no time flat but thats no fault of the product. I ended up making one out of chain and that  the chewing issue.,4
"Got these for my puppy and will buy more as I forget to put one on my wrist and end up somewhere with out one.  So far, so good though.  She dead stops running and stops barking when I blow the whistle and 2 clicks means come, and it works (most of the time...... especially if I have a cookie in my hand).  Consistency is the key and remember you are smarter than they are!",5
This is impossible to use on a small dog's teeth.  The bristles are too big to fit beneath the gum line.  Thus was a complete waste of money.,1
"I have been battling cat vomit for the last couple of years.  I have tried many foods (Iams, Newman's Own, HALO Spot, etc.).  My cats would either not eat it or would vomit several times a week.

This stuff is amazing.  My cats are not only NOT vomiting, but they are eating less, drinking less and are much happier and more energetic.

Before this food, one of my cats had chronic diarrhea.  Since they started eating this (3 weeks ago), his stool has firmed up to some extent (not where I'd like it, but better).",5
"Excellent quality, will buy from again, thank you so much!!!",5
I'm sure it's good but Lucy The Beagle would have none of it - gave it to our Vet!,3
"The bags came very quickly. The colors are nice and bright. However, the only thing I am uneasy about the the thickness (or lackthereof) of the actual bags. The bags are very thin but have yet to break. I've been using them for about a month for two dogs and so far so good. I wouldn't recommend if you have a large dog who poops alot. The bags are not long enough for large poop and for a successful tied end. Overall I'm pleased with the price and the bags.",4
"This is a very compact and helpful item, but when I walk my dogs, I have two on a leash and my mind and hands are full with keeping them in line.  I gave this to a friend, however, who is a dog trainer and handler and she thinks this item is really nice (she's more coordinated than I am).  The Dog Walking Organizer is well made and looks nice but it's just too much for me (is there anything as a product that is too helpful?)  I'm sure if someone - like my friend - who has very well-mannered dogs and knows what she is doing, this item would be very handy and helpful.",4
Turns itself off constantly with just a tiny little tap. Had to get something else for night walks with the pup.,1
"Ms. Josey Wales won the ugliest dog contest in Colorado. This ""call girl"" outfit just added to her personality!",5
"very pleased!! Great price, great seller, prompt service!",5
Great,5
Healthy Good Dog Treats !!,5
"Furry kids loved this pack particularly the red and green ball. Our girl who rarely plays just loves this ball so we must get her a couple more since we need her to get some good exercise in.
Is there a pack of this ball alone? If so we so need a couple to keep our chubby girl happy and moving.",5
works,5
My two Abyssinian cats took to this scratcher immediately.  I placed it right next to our tall speakers (the cats had been tempted to scratch on the Klipsch speaker!) now they are happy to use this scratcher instead.  Good kitties!!!,5
good item,5
"Even though the bowl is large, you have to keep it filled to a specific level.  Found I was always adding water.  I returned it and am back to a regular water bowl.",1
"I don't remember if I've ordered these before, but the bones were soft and not crunchy.",3
"This is a MUST for pet owners! Works so well I just order 3 more to have around the house! I was skeptical at first, but after using it to clean lint and cat fur off our bed and pillows I am now a huge fan! Saves me money from purchasing sticky lint rollers or pulling out the vacuum. I was going to buy the cheaper knocks, but so glad I didn't. Amazing product and worth the price!",5
They can't get enough of these. I have 3 packages as they disappear under furniture but my kittens are now a year old and they still love these springs. They've never broken which I was concerned about.,5
"Absolutely worthless. It prevents the dog from opening their mouths so they can't pant or drink water, and it stretches so it's trivial for the dog to get off. Looked away for five minutes and my dog had already shredded it to pieces.",1
"so I bought this on sale, I have too cats, and basically the only part my one cat uses is the very top. its still snug for him to fit but he lays in it every evening. The rest of it is unused. The elements are just too small, I bet it would be great for kittens. I had erad reviews that had said the same thing. I should have ""listened"" . Bought it for $90, a little much for just one spot used....",3
"This bed is nice, it fit the crate we bought,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Petedge-Easy-Wire-Dog-Crate-Small-Black/dp/B003DVTPGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Petedge Easy Wire Dog Crate, Small, Black</a>, perfectly (but was not ""slightly larger"" than the crate as the product description claims, it really was just a perfect fit, which was nice!). Unfortunately our puppy has a thing for chewing on fabric... we're working on it but the fact that he has managed to chew bits of the fluff off of this bed (or perhaps out from under the bumper, or both) is a disappointment. He's not a very strong chewer right now (he's only 13 weeks, a mini labradoodle) but quite a lot of fluff has ended up in his mouth and on the floor around the crate (and no, he doesn't constantly chew on it--he sleeps quite well in his crate and has a soft chew toy in there that he likes a lot).

Overall the bed is still holding up. Perhaps a good run through a washing machine before the puppy got to it would have eliminated a lot of the free fluff (though it doesn't say if it's washing machine or dryer safe from what I've read Sherpa typically is). If that ends up helping us I'll update this review!",3
DELICIOUS!,5
"It scrapes really well if needed, but the scalloped edges make it hard to scoop for some reason. Very large though! Makes it easy to scoop a large pee.",3
Piggies love to snack on these!!,5
Lasted 10  minutes.,1
helps keep fleas off of my kitty.,5
Good product.,5
"You will never have to worry about the battery.
I have bought this ball at least 6 times.  Every time, with in the first 30 days, I will toss it and the ball will bounce and the led light will go off.
I lose the ball.",2
"not the greatest thing for your dogs to eat, but will keep them occupied for 5-10 min",3
too cumbersome and time consuming to do.,2
This fell off without real use. The hook to hang it doesn't fit right.,1
Sturdy and functional.,5
Took less than 2 hours for my 1.5 year old lab to demolish. Kong has been the only toy he cannot destroy.,1
"Works as well as you expect these inexpensive collars too work.. Which, is not that well.. Even for a medium size dog. Maybe keep fleas off of them from another dog or two, but if there are areas outside or multiple dogs around. Such as a dog park. Just as many fleas end up on the dog. Fleas just avoid the neck area.",3
My dog loves this thing. She loves it even more than a real antler!,5
Theses pads are the best. I use them for my little dog who can't always make it outside .,5
"I needed this cat food only not the grilled version. I wanted and believe I ordered the Classic version. Maybe not, I'm always ready to blame myself for an error but in any case my cats don't like the grilled and won't eat it. So I'm sitting on 1 and 1/2 cases of cat food that l paid for and the cats won't eat it. Anyone want to buy it ??",1
"Very happy with these bags. I use them at home and wanted something easier to work with than the individual rolls. This is a great tissue-like dispenser and the bags are thin but durable. If I have to use something wasteful for waste, I'd rather it be as little waste as possible :)",5
"I have a tiny pomeranian who has a broken front leg, the vet wants to amputate but we are holding off to see if the bone heals. I started googling supplements to help aid in healing and found Boneo, so far it's NOT working and the bone is being absorbed. Now the orthopedic surgeon is trying something else to see if a soft bandage will work better then a cast, I'll update this review if there is a change because I'm continuing the Boneo in hope that my dog just needed to be on it longer. My dog has been on it for over a month and neither my vet, Nor the orthopedic surgeon or any of the staff at both clinics have ever heard of Boneo. I feel very let down by this product.",1
"My ferret loves this food.  She will scratch (the floor - not me) if she's hungry and she doesn't have any in her bowl.  I heard that ferrets are notorious in not recognizing food after a certain age.  For my ferret at least, not so.  Maybe she hated her old food, but at 2 /12 I switched to this brand.  I put this food and her old one together thinking that she needed time to adjust.  However, she ate ONLY this new food and snub the old.  And just after one feeding.  And one really nice thing about it.  It doesn't smell.  This is great because she likes to hide some of the food under the bed.  Maybe for a midnight snack?  (She did this with her old food also.  That really smelled.)  Lastly, it can be left out in her bowl for awhile.  She like to eat in strange cycles and at odd times.  Some days it seems that she hardly eats at all and some other days she pigs out.",5
"So, my cat loves food, and it's not terribly hard to please her.  But, I have to be careful what types of treats I allow her since some of the cheaper brands make her barf.  These are great, and I love the fact that they also help clean her teeth.",5
"solid 10, for more things than fleas..look it up, don't miss this buy..this stuff is , WOW",5
My Chinch loves these so I guess they are good!,5
"OMG!!  I have never seen my dogs react to something like they did with this Rawbble!  I do my best to feed them high quality foods within my budget (They eat Wellness CORE and Simple) typically and there are no complaints all around.  They are very healthy and happy with their food.  But, when i get a chance to try something like Rawbble, I jump at the chance.  Not only is it raw freeze-dried meat/fish, but its 100% sourced and made in the USA.  I will be honest and say that, for me, it's too expensive for a regular diet, but for a topper or treats, I can do it.  And boy does that make me popular!  (actually, they already adore me , but ...)  GREAT stuff.  Highly recommended.",5
"The order listed this under cat food, but the picture of the adorable Boston bull on the bag is what prompted me to get this for my dog.  I am so glad that I did.

The food is natural and has a salmon base and other nutrients.  Nulu is definitely a high caliber, exceptional dog food and my dog loves it.  So do my dog's two basenji friends.  They yodel and wag their curly tails with delight.  My dog seems more alert and as others noted, quality of dog's stools have improved.  I highly recommend Nulo products for pet nutrition.",5
My dogs love this food! Love that the meat they use is also raised humanely and organically.,5
"Loved this product, was plenty of bling for my little diva",5
"My Pit Bull has had some allergies with a lot of different foods-- leaving him itchy and smelly. After spending over 1000$ at the vet to help our big guy get better-- The vet told us to try around different foods since he is obviously having a reaction. We always buy quality food with little to no grain, so this was surprising for us.

 Since I have turned his diet over to this specific brand and type (Taste of the Wild- Prairie), he doesn't smell and he has ceased from scratching. It really has been a little of a miracle for us.",5
"We like their products and they are good for our big baby, keeps him out of trouble and prevents him from chewing other things for short periods of time. We have two busy buddy bones which use the rawhide crackers. Please not the large size was not easy to find.",4
Arrived exactly as expected.,5
"reliable brand, good ingredients, dog eats it - that's all i ask of her",5
"I bought this and at first I thought it was going to work. But, after two days of using this, my cat started throwing up again and became lethargic. I discontinued using it and went back to Petromalt. Now, my cat is perking up again and getting sick less. It may work good for others, but not with my cat.",2
Perfect!  Thank you!!,5
My little chihuahua loves to play fetch. Normal tennis balls are too large for her and the dogs tear the felt off the outside. This ball is just the right size and easy for her to grab and go. We bought another one at the local pet store when both of our dogs showed interest in playing with it. Would buy again and again!,5
"My corgi would bark, look in the direction of the device and then keep on barking.",1
very well made and delivered same day as ordered,5
This was a waste of money for me as he doesn't use these just like he didn't use these either. a waste of $20.00,2
works great,5
PRETTY COLOR,5
My dog likes it. Poop is nice and it has little pieces of meat in it. Yum.,5
"My cats would not eat it, i had to try a different one. Try a small bag first too make sure you're cats like it. It's also important to gradually switch over, I started with a 20%mix. Sadly my cats picked out the old food and left this.",1
Worth every penny. My lab heeler mix.is only 45 pounds but is an aggressive chewer and when I buy large.pieces they are gone within a week. Not this one. She has been gnawing on it for a couple months and I would guess it will take.her another 3 or four months to get it down to a size I think is a choking hazard.  I will never buy from anyone else.,5
I have pets and a toddler and usually have the carpets professionally cleaned once a year.  So as you now we have accidents every now and then in between cleanings.  I have a lighter carpet and you can definately see spills and messes.  I have used the Bissell Spotlifter twice so far & both times with the spot vanishing.  First time was some muddy dog tracks.  Second time was some juice my son spilled.  I was impressed with this little machine and I'm quite sure I will be using it again soon.,5
"Works, but not great.",3
"Wow.  This really works!  I have a 15 pound, 6 year-old dachshund that I rescued 6 months ago.  He was not given much guidance in his life and he came to me as a barker.  To discourage his barking, I used pennies in a soda can, shaken right by his ear and saying ""No bark!""  It works, but it is not always practical to carry around a soda can.  The first time I tried the First Alert, he stopped barking immediately.  I made sure he saw what I had in my hand when I used it and firmly said, ""No bark.""  When he was quiet, I gave him a treat.  After a few times, all I had to do was show him the device and say ""No bark"" and he immediately stopped barking.  I still occasionally follow up with a treat, but the barking is under control.",5
"so far, so good. its hard to put on but its very usefull",4
"Cats love the shreds, so they'll keep getting them.",5
Dog likes to eat these. But I think he's just a natural born destroyer of nice things.,5
"I'm sure this is better than nothing, however it isn't really quite large enough to collect most of the litter debris. I ended up upgrading to a larger mat with the little plasticy groves to help tug and allow the litter to more efficiently come off the cat's paws. I am now using this product in conjunction with the better mat to help collect the tiny percentage the other mat misses as the cat is on it's way to roam the rest of my home.",3
"Absolutely the best for my small kitten rescues!!! Large enough for kittens, litter box, and toys! LOVE IT! Great buy!",5
"it is NOT 2 colors and is only 12 inches long
never will buy from this seller again
very disappointed",1
I have had this tank about a year now and have experienced a lot of issues with this tank. The tank looks amazing and the filtration works as expected. The lighting for this tank is another issue. About three months in the blue night lights stopped functioning and after about 9 months half of the white LEDs no longer function. There is a replacement available on Amazon. But I personally don't think I should need to replace it after such a short period of time.,2
"I love these! My dogs will not go to bed without one! It is their ""night cookie"" and I feel good about giving them something healthy for a treat. They are also a good value. MY BABIES RATE THEM A FIVE STAR!",5
functional. good value considering the price amazon sells these.,5
"My cats lost interest in this toy after the first day. We bought another cat toy at the same time, one with a wand and fabric attached, and the cats loved it...  and continue to play with it everyday. Lots of trial and error with cat toys, I guess!",2
We have a female Rott and this brush just didn't do it for us. Ended up going with a furminator which saved a lot of time during shedding season.,2
My dogs aren't crazy about this food. I have to mix something in it for them to eat it.,3
"The only thing that worked for my dogs this year.  We tried front line, cap star pill and a lot of bathes with no luck.",5
Everyone who owns a long hair cats needs this comb! This is the only thing that works to prevent my cats hair from matting. All other brushes just got the top of the coat.,5
Only canned food my picky eater will accept,5
the heavy weight is great for staying put when my pooch eats,3
"I wanted to replace my fluorescent aquarium hood with an LED light, and I heard about FInnex looking around online.  I didn't want a basic light that only had on or off.  I was really looking for something that had different lighting features, and I like the 24/7 feature on this one.  I also like that it supports plant growth.  I have a 44 gallon pentagon aquarium, which is pretty deep (24 inches), and this light penetrates very well.  When set to the max setting, it provides nice color even at the depth of my tank.  Overall I am very happy with this light and would purchase a Finnex product again if I ever need more lighting.",5
"My daughter's dog wears this daily so as she is running loose in the woods, my daughter can see her.  So far, so good.  Nioce quality, well made.",5
"As a dog trainer,  I am always looking for quality supplies at a reasonable price and this certainly satisfies that criteria!",5
"low water level, maybe a touch too low, but it works",3
This was the only harness that fit our cockapoo puppy. Every other we tried were too big!,5
"It came without the little rake,,, I guess I don't care that much,, since the brush and scrapper are fine..  It is built well and I like it.",4
"My five Jack, Parson, Russels love it.  The variable speed is the key for them to line up for a back rub!  The fact that there is no heat involved actually works better than a hair dryer, which  is never the right temp. I thought it might bother their ears and had put in cotton balls, but they shook them out, didn't need them. My Russies' have three types of coats, and they vary from tiny to normal size.  I am surpised at how powerful this unit is.  Doubt that I'll ever use it at full speed, but glad to have it just in case. Now, if they would just wait to take their turn, I'd be a happy camper!!!.",5
Very nice to use at night to be able to see your pet.  The light can be adjusted to which light you want it to be.  Easy to put on.,5
"I had been using Panacur, Nemex II an Safeguard but I had one dog that was still running thin and I kept seeing tapes in his stool. Turns out he needed the TWO tapeworm meds in this wormer to do the job. His turnaround was immediate and I saw weight gain in less than a week. All my adults are on Worm X Plus now.",5
"Gets the job done, wish it was bigger",4
puppies love these and a great price for a huge container..seems to last forever,5
"My dog Charlie LOVES balls. I bought the standard orange Chuckit and it was his favorite ball. To challenge him, I wanted to see if I could try some different kinds of balls so I ordered these:
 Chuck it Medium Wheelie Dog Ball
Chuckit! Large Ultra Tug
Chuckit! Medium Evader Dog Ball
Chuckit! Large The Whistler Ball 3-Inch
Chuckit! Medium Rebounce Ball 2.5-Inch, 2-Pack
Chuckit! Erratic Ball, Large, 3-Inch, 1-Pack
Chuckit! Sport 26L Launcher and the Medium Launcher
Chuckit! Large Max Glow Ball 3-Inch, 1-Pack

At it was a big fat THUD. Charlie hated them, I didn't know how to make them work they way they were supposed to work and thought I had wasted my money. But after a week, when I finally started to get the hang of it. The wheelie ball was a hoot. Charlie had never chased anything the like that before and he was totally thrown by it. The erratic ball and the evader started to make sense to him and he started enjoying them as well.

I finally got my Launchers and we went to the soccer field to throw the various balls as far as I could throw. Now he loves all of them, but the standard, large Chuckit ball is his favorite. The light blue balls and the whistler is hard for him to see, so we don't throw them very far when we are playing with them.

It was interesting to see how he responded to the glow in the dark. Charlie is seven years old and has ""EXPECTATIONS"" about what a ball is supposed to do. So he was actually shy about playing with it. Sam, our three year old Lab, on the other hand has ""NO EXPECTATION"" about what a ball is or isn't supposed to do. He loved it! Charlie warmed up to it after he saw Sam playing with it.

So all in all, I'd say they were a great addition to our dog toy collection. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.",5
"I can't argue with the common complaint.....it can be hard to see the difference between the shades of gray and blue. But if you are using Seachem's cupramine, and you should be, the margin of safe error is much greater than any slight differences in color. You must remember, at least in marine tanks, that copper disappears from the water by almost half each day. So without adding more cupramine, you should expect your levels to be constantly, slowly dropping. So don't be surprised that after you dose the medicine to see an appropriate level immediately after, and the next day, a much lower level. This is why you must test copper at least every day, if not more. Otherwise, your copper level will dip below therapeutic levels. But the good news is.....cupramine at least, is safe at rather generous levels above the recommended dose.  In other words....it's hard to overdose. So don't be paranoid that you can't tell the difference between two very close shades of blue gray.  Cupramine, and by extension, this test kit, has never killed a fish of mine. And it works. Just wait a few minutes after testing to read the test! Important! You will see a darker color as compared to reading it straight away. I know it scary. Suck it up, Buttercup and get rid of that ich.",4
"We really love this Sof-Krate.  We bought it for home and still have note used it to transport, but it looks as if it would be fine for that.  It is well made and gets really good reviews.",5
"The only time I used this, it didn't have much effect on my cat. That being said, it could have very well been worse without this product.",3
Not as pictured or as described. Says 3 rocks. Came with 27 very small crunched rocks.  Very dissatisfied with purchase.,1
great value.fresh. varied sizes which works well for me because my birds are different sizes as well. EASY TO STORE in zip lock bags or tall containers,5
"These cost about $5 each at my local grocery store. Pet Smart used to have them but none of them (within 5 cities circumference) carries them any more. I'm so happy to have found them online.

My cat absolutely loves these things. More than any other toy he's ever had. My previous cat (female) also loved them the most. They're small enough to be carried around in their mouths, but not small enough for them to actually swallow them. I have over 20 of them in my cat toy drawer for his birthdays and on holidays.

I don't know what it is about these things, but they're magical.",5
My cat eats these! He's very finicky.,5
"This product works well, one of my cats can get really angry and this works to calm him down.  I had no issues, didn't have to contact the seller and the product arrived in a timely manner.",5
People say bad things about jebao but I've had great luck with them. Awesome  product.,5
She loves it!!! It's chilly around here in the winter but my sweet boxer mix loves her cuddly bed. It's soft so she was eager to curl up in it from the start. There's something very satisfying and comforting about watching your best friend sleep deeply and comfortably!,5
The corn snakes like it but tend to just stretch out on top.  I'm still working out how to secure it without buying two to fasten together.,4
I thought our dog would love these more since they maid a noise. But he doesn't seem very interested with them.,3
I like this effortless pliable multi-sized lid much better than the usual stiff can covering.,5
"Fish, even betta, need at least 2.5 gallons, a filter, and a heater to live a happy and healthy life.

Fun fact: a common goldfish needs 20 gallons of filtered water to live a healthy life. With this they often surpass 10 years.",1
"Our 8 lb ball-freak Morky is crazy about his Chewy Vuiton! He doesn't destroy his things, so it should last.. as long as it remains an indoor toy. I did order another one tho' just in case ;)  Thanks, DDD LLC, I love all your toys!",5
For the right cat it is awesome. Have to have a playful cat.,5
I have to fill up lots and lots of toys with yogurt/dog food/ peanut butter and then freeze them in an effort to prevent my rescue dog form destroying my house while I go  make money so I can keep her. This is probably my least favorite. It just seems like it frustrates more than challenges her and getting food/ yogurt in it is a pain and then cleaning it is ugggg just more work.,3
This works. I've tried all sorts of other things and they don't. Just go with this one.,5
"These are perfect...good price, good size and they work! I also appreciate that the underside is a light green color...all the other brands I have used are white on both sides...and I have put the plasticized side down too many times.,,ugh. Another thing I REALLY like...they are easy to unfold...if you have used other brands, you know what I am talking about :-)",5
No stars is more like it.  This product smells so foul that we took it off several hours after we bought it.  It smells like citrus baby vomit.  So disgusting.,1
I searched for a heavy pet food bowl.  I was astonished by how light weight this is.  I didn't care if it was spill proof as it is going to be outside but wanted something heavy enough that heavy winds could not blow it around.  This is not the bowl I thought it would be at all.  I do not recommend for that reason.,1
"Too small, way smaller than listed. And now I can't return the item and am stuck with it.",1
"My dogs love to chew on these! Keeps them entertained. Especially when we have quests over. I have smaller 10-15 lb dog and 1bone can last a week, but wish my Siberian husky it last Maine 15-25mins . I like have the bones because it keeps my animals focused on those rather than on jumping or annoying the company...",5
"Using with a 125 pound Cane Corso Mastiff. She seems comfortable in it. I appreciate the handle on the top for additional control when needed. Was concerned with the stretch material at the side neck area that it was not sturdy enough for my powerful dog, though it has not shown to be problematic. That being said, we aren't walking daily and she is not an especially difficult puller or lunger. I might not recommend this for a very insistent & powerful puller.",4
runs a little big...,4
Nice carrier for very small pets. My cats are 12-15 lbs and this was much too small for them. Not tall enough for them to stand or turn in. I am not sure the screen in sides and door will stand up to cat claws. Perhaps will work for a kitten. I returned and replaced with hard side carrier.,2
Great size for my little dog and when you open the bag you smell blueberries. I give them to coworkers so they can give Lucy multiple treats without upsetting her digestive system or increasing her weight.,5
"These were recommended by the vet and I was leary whether my cat would actually eat it, since I haven't had success with similar products.  Luckily, the cat loves them.  Success",5
Perfect and does the trick.  We use it everyday and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.,5
"The digital interface is very hard to program. The amount of food released is insufficient for a dog over 50 lbs.  The storage bin is light weight and easily toppled.  The lid does not fit on very tightly, I had to taped it shut with duct tape.  It does delliver the food on time.

JCA DVM",2
My dogs love these,5
"16 inches is really not that big.  My small female sleeps in it from time to time but she looks scrunched and I believe she prefers the couch.  I have a tom cat and there's no way he could fit into this bed.  If this is a standard size I will have to get him a dog bed.  Also the picture makes it look like the sides are kind of tall and sturdy.  They aren't, and when the cat lays in it the sides flatten out.  I think overall I was disappointed in it but as long as the cat likes it, that's all that really matters. I'm not the one sleeping in it.  The cover is soft and it's nice that it's washable.",3
"Bought these for my 2 dogs, and they work great!  Plenty bright enough for night time use.  You have a choice of a steady red LED light, or flashing.  I can now monitor the dogs movement at night when they go into the wooded area in front of the house.  They never go beyond the Invisible Fence area, but it's nice to know that the dogs are still contained within the yard.  The dogs get a kick out of it too.  Because of the lights, each one of the dogs thinks it's a game of laser tag and chase each other.  It's pretty comical.

I purchased the large size collar for a 80 lb. Goldendoodle and the medium size collar for a 28 lb. mini Goldendoodle.  The size large is way-too-large for the 80 pound dog.  Because of the LED lighting string, I cannot adjust the collar smaller than 23 inches, The description says it can be adjusted to 18 inches, but I don't see how.  The portion of the collar with the LED light string will not go thru the plastic clip, making it impossible to adjust.  If anyone knows how to get this down to 18 inches, let me know.  Unless your dog has the neck the size of a small pony, I would suggest getting the medium and adjusting it to the largest length.  I did purchase another size medium for the big pooch.  Great product, great idea!",5
This is a well built item. I got the large size and it's too large for my 50# dog. He doesn't seem to really like it that much. The feeder toy works well I think my dog just wants to be lazy.,4
"The bowl is ok, but customers should absolutely have the choice on color..why would you not offer that option???",3
"Worked wonders! My cat gets very dry skin in the winter; he scratches and gets scabs all around his neck and looses quite a bit of hair. After using this product his scabs are gone and his hair has returned! Plus, he was so soft for several weeks.  I really couldn't be more grateful for this product.",5
"Been using this product consistantly for like 8 months now, nothing has ripped or broken in any way. I've recommended it to all my friends with dogs.",5
My St. Bernard loves it and it's healthy for her.,5
Birds love this,5
good stuff- you need this if you have shrimp. especially if you have baby shrimp. buy it,5
Nice cage for the money exactly as described,5
"Really nice

Great quality collar

Came with a cute blue and gold crown charm on the pale blue collar....

sadly that dropped off somewhere in a week or two",4
I love these harnesses because they help teach the dog to heal without the use of pinch or choke collars.  Healing has become 2nd nature to my dog so walking is easy and fun.,5
my dog loves this Squirrel,4
"I'm very pleased with these balls.  They are extremely durable so if you are looking for something stronger than a tennis ball, this product is for you.  They hold up well both indoors and outdoors.  I only buy the smaller ones now for my 40 pound dog because I'm worried the larger ones could hurt her teeth when she tries to catch it out of the air.",5
"Cuts very well. I love the guard that is built-in. I was very nervous about using it for my puppy, but with the guard, it was very easy. Saved $10/trim at the groomers!",5
Works with the fountain.,5
Works great but the lids were not tightened so they leaked in the shipping box.,4
"I was surprisingly pleased.  Really great stroller for the cost, easy to put together and fold up - my Maltese has trouble on long walks and loves it; I appreciate not having to carry him after he gets tired.",4
I bought the bones as a treat for my friend's English Bull dog  and American Bull dog. Unfortunately they splintered after a couple of bites. My friend's small dog a chihuahua enjoyed the bone.  I do not recommend these bones for large dogs however for medium sized dogs they are a nice treat.,4
Red Sea rocks.. Awesome food and even better that it helps nopox work better.,5
"I have two little bark-a-holics (shihtzu-pom and havanese-lhasa). I bought this so I don't have to try to scream ""NO BARK!!!"" at the top of my lungs. I learned that there are at least 2 dog whistle frequencies, so wasn't sure if this would work at all. When I first blew the whistle, it seemed like nothing was happening - they did NOT immediately stop barking their fool heads off...but I kept up with it...blowing long and loud, saying a sharp ""no bark"" and repeat. Within a week the barking has gone down considerably. Not only does it happen less often, but it stops much quicker (unless it's something REALLY juicy, like a cat taunting them from a few feet away). I doubt the barking will every disappear, but this has helped...my neighbors may even start to think I'm sane :P",4
I have used the Breeze system for years and I will never go back to clay litter. Its great for lots of cats but the pellets are so expensive and there is no alternative to them unlike the pads.,5
"This is a great insecticide that is useful for fleas, ticks and even bed bugs! The odor is not unpleasant. If the unthinkable infestation occurs, this product is an effective tool toward the battle that you we on't mind using. Adams is a solid name in ""pest death"" that doesn't ruin your wallet.",5
I bought several of these mats for my cat litters. They are great size and don't get destroyed from cats scratching on them. Catches litter and easy to vaccumed it up.,5
"Tried to go with natural products for a flea infestation, but to no avail.  At least the smell was not unpleasant.  Might work better as a more preventative measure.  I ended up bombing the house twice and washing all 3 cats with Dawn, one of them twice, to get things under control.  Next Spring we'll give Capstar and Program a shot if the fleas come back - I have read good things.",2
"Just discovered that my basset cannot tolerate this formula and that the return window has expired.  I have always purchased Hip and Joint Formula Level 1 and have been pleased with this formula.  However, the Level 1 is no longer available.  If you require a glucosamine formula equivalent to the Level 1 from Peachtree Pets, you should look elsewhere.",1
"I happened to stumble on this ear wash by chance one day. It was really the only ear cleaner on the shelf at my local pet store & the label made it seem decent. Well I'm so glad I got it!!  It is my best friend for cleaning my furbabies' (5) ears. None of them are fans of ear cleanings but this makes it so simple. After cleaning their ears once, I simply add a few drops to each ear once every few weeks & massage it around. That's it!!!  It smells amazing, cleans in a snap & protects against infections. I recently just recommended it to my mom who just adopted an older beagle with huge ears. She's uses a few drops once a week & his ears are also squeaky clean!  Definitely try this ear wash... Highly recommended!",5
Good,5
"When you open the can, it has big chunks of fish and some gravy. My cats love gravy, so I scoop out a third of the can into a small dish and break up the fish chunks and add 2 tablespoons of water to make it go further. My cats are in heaven!",5
So far so good.  The dog hasn't chewed it to pieces.  He loves it.,5
"Stay away from this garbage.  So far there has been no blood as other reviews have said, but I'm so afraid.  Nothing can replace brushing a dog's teeth, and as far as chewing for any benefit, stick to bully sticks!  In the trash they go!",1
the casts love ti just that bottom step when you have to clean droped litter,5
These clippers are amazing. I have three small Yorkie Dogs.  The clippers make it so easy for me to trim their nails without making them bleed or without hurting them. Even my fussy female lets me cut her nails without trying to get away.  The company is very solicitous and will work with you in every way possible to see that you get the right size for your dogs or cats.  There is the size chart to measure your pets nails so please make sure you get the chart and check the size before you order.  I can't say enough good things about the small little clippers. I ordered a size 4 for my small dogs. Hope that helps.,5
Sooo cute but too small I ordered a medium for my bichon and it was tiny,1
"I have two finicky cats both with allergies, so I have to be really careful with dust and fragrances.

This litter seems to work really well for them.  It's lower in dust than a lot of brands, and it's unscented so I don't need to worry so much about allergies.  It clumps well -- better than some, not quite as good as a couple of other brands, but certainly OK for me.  I scoop a couple of times a day and have had no real issues at all.

The odor control is good, too.  I have breathing issues so the low dust combined with no fragrance and good odor control makes my life a lot easier.

Will continue to order and use this brand as long as it's economically feasible.",4
wished it had door on top also,5
Super heavy duty and we'll made! I am impressed!,5
"While both of my cats are intrigued by this toy - the younger one gets more use out of it - I can't imagine what they think of the flat foam disc-shaped ""mice"".  They are cats, after all, and any object that peeks out from behind a curtain is going to get their attention, and, fortunately, the toy is solidly constructed and will stand up to plenty of abuse.  I love how decorative the little mouse house is, I think I probably get as much of a kick out of it as the cats do, I only wish the company would've kept the original 3D mouse-that-actually-looks-like-a-mouse design. Why not, at the very least, stick a plastic head on top of the foam disc, Storytime Toys people?",4
...it's a DNA kit and it takes two plus weeks...what's not to love?...,4
Perfect,5
"I have two kennels for my dog, one at home and one at the office. I purchased the fleece pet bed for the one at home and decided to try the faux fur one for the office. My baby loves it. She rolled all over it, then passed out asleep.",5
"Long lasting.  Great to take along when visiting.  Keeps my wild child ridgeback happily occupied, right there in the middle of things, while I talk and visit.",5
I purchased two ProSelect 4 quart stainless pails about three months ago.  Both have already started rusting.,1
They work awesome.,5
bought them for my Dad's dog when I went to visit him in Massachusetts as my Dad constantly gives treats to his dog.  I like the idea that they are low calories and small enough so I know my Dad isn't overfeeding the spoiled Yorkie.....,5
"Our frenchie was sometimes skipping breakfast, not eating til we got home in the afternoon.  Since adding a squirt of this stuff to her food in the morning, no longer an issue.  She loves it, and we are happy knowing this is healthy for her coat.  The pump makes it simple to ration and it doesn't require refrigeration so it could not be easier to use.  I have added it as a subscribe & save.",5
I like to give my small dogs crunchy treats for better health of their teeth. These are just right. And my dogs love the taste.,5
"This is the only food that my cats will actually eat, rather than just lick. And they have been getting it for close to a year now. Finicky cats that like their food. Go figure. And it is grain free, by product free, very moist so it's easy to serve. Healthy for my boys with their soft, silky coats. It does have some vegetables in it, which are not especially popular, but so worth the money otherwise!",5
"i have a female pitbull who has seperation anxiety problems... when i started school this fall she started peeing on the carpet on my hallway. i did everything i could to stop her and clean up the messes, but she just kept doing it. it stopped the day i plugged this thing in and has never happened again.

worked for my dog!",5
Keep the back set clean,5
"This product is very sturdy and well made.  However, it was a waste on my dog.  She will get some food in her mouth and take it to the carpet and eat.  So she is still bending down to eat.  I am sure it is a great product for other dogs.",3
Super cute on the hat is big but I have a 35 pound lab puppy and the medium for perfect!,5
"My 90 lb lab mix adores these bagles, enjoys the hardness of them and occupies longer than smaller treats, however.....by nighttime my bedroom smells very garlicky. That is the big drawback. However, I will keep buying them as he loves them and I know garlic is healthy for him. Ingredients are all healthy.",5
"I never thought about my cats' drinking habits until my aunt tried to sell me on a fountain. I didn't have to refill my cats' regular water feeder that often, but I thought they probably drank enough?

This went on sale and holds probably 2x the water that their old feeder did - and I find myself filling it up at about the same rate as before! My two cats love drinking from the fountain itself, plus the filters keep the water clean (and traps any loose fur).

Just make sure to clean it regularly (manual suggests every week, I've been doing once a month).",5
It's a nice toy but my cats didn't care for it.,1
Great item at a great price.,5
Perfect. My girl loves it. My furbaby is little for an adult six year old cat. The little grater part helps to not track too much litter out of the box. Good purchase!,5
"Great price, fast shipping. Can't complain.",5
"I tried this stuff out and it worked just fine for a few days, seemed like it was working.  Turns out, it was probably just the hydrocortizone kicking in.  Went to Vet's Best ear cleaner/wash and PROBLEM SOLVED.",2
"If you are thinking of teaching your dog (or new puppy) to ring a bell to go outside, these are a must have. These easily hang from any door and are reachable by any size dog - our puppies were only 3 lbs when we started training them (now 10 lbs), and they were able to nose / paw at them to signal that they wanted to go outside. In fact, they like using it to signal the water bowl is empty, that they are hungry, that there is a bird outside that they want to bark at - it is a pretty neat communication tool!

You can look it up on youtube as to how to teach a dog to ring a bell - it just takes some patience. You hold the bells in front of them, tell them bell, and wait for them to bonk it, whatever method they prefer. The first bonk is the hardest - once they do it, you give them a treat, and then they will definitely repeat it. You keep treating them, and eventually they understand ""bell"" = ringing the bell = yummy treats. Then step 2 is hanging it on the door, and before you let them go out to potty, you tell them ""bell"" - make them ring the bell to go outside, and that is their treat. Once they become more potty trained, they will ring the bell proactively to go out!",5
Someone failed to pay attention to detail. Sent liver treats & not chicken. My dogs do not like the liver. They are being returned.,1
Great clippers.,5
great.,5
Finally a scratcher my cat likes. good price,5
"The worst pads I have ever used!!!! I have used pads for 23 years and these are the worst ever! The padding is falling all over and uneven on every pad! I will NEVER ORDER PADS FROM AMAZON AGAIN! I am a loyal Amazon customer, and buy frequently. I should get a total refund!!!!",1
Cats love it!,5
"Doesn't work worth a damn!! I can smell cat urine all day, every day.  My whole house stinks like hell. This litter sucks. I'm going back to Tidy Cats!!!",1
My KC has over took it. SO I guess it makes a good dog bed too!,5
Great product! My Great Dane had soft stool for a few weeks then I tried this and within 3 days he was feeling much better.,5
Good product but too expensive for me with 4 dogs,4
"Too light weight, our small puppy pushed it out of shape easily causing her to be uncomfortable in a smaller space.",2
Puppies love this toy.,5
This really does work. I have 4 stray cats that come to get fed and they really made my porch stinky like cat piss! I hated that smell. I used this product and the smell went away immediately. Problem solved.,5
"Bought this toy yrs ago and my cats love it, they drag it around with them. Found this and bought it as a spare.",5
ok,5
"Not a useful toy.  Not good as a toy, and the ice/water thing is a brick.",2
"excellent collar for large dogs.  Especially for Angel, my German Shepherd who likes to chase cats.  The collar helps me keep that WAY down.",5
"The Instinct Raw Boost Mixers are a ""meal enhancement"" for adding protein to dry kibble food. We have two 14-year old cats who are sometimes picky eaters. (Are there any cats out there that aren't picky?) I sprinkled these Mixers on their food and they really enjoyed them. I didn't have a problem with them picking them out of the dry kibble - it was actually the opposite, they ate the mixers out of the dry food.

The texture is a little odd since the mixers are freeze dried. They are very light and airy. I was expecting something closer to the density of dry food in a larger format. Given how light they are, the price seems a little daunting. A bag is 24 servings (depending on the size of your cat - one of ours is 14 lbs. so the 1/8 cup recommendation is too little for him), so it's just under a dollar per serving.

The quality seems excellent. The ingredients are good - cage free chicken, and vegetables and fruit. No grains, no gluten (are cats sensitive to gluten??). I received a free sample in exchange for a review of the product. I'm not sure I would pay for this due to the cost, but my cats definitely enjoyed it.",5
Cat hated this bed. Had to throw it away since he hated it so much. The quality was fine but definitely not liked by our cat.,3
My sensitive tummy cat is finally doing really well thanks to this and royal cannin sensitive can food.,5
"LOVE this bed. It is sturdy, well constructed and my dogs were super comfy. Easy to take apart and put back together after washing. The material holds up after multiple washings (I am a twice a week washer of my dog beds).",5
"Update: bought another one for my doxie. Bought the 10inch thinking that was the size we already had. LOL turns out it was bigger. But it was all good, she LOVES it even more than the 8inch blue one. Best purchase ever! In the pictures, the red is 10inch, blue is 8inch.
Saw this at petsmart and my doxie is obsessed with balls. I bought it as kind of a joke cause it was so big. SHE LOVES IT. Takes it to potty every time. she has ripped apart the handle pretty well. But she can't tear up the actual ball cause it's so big. She loves to chase it in the yard.",5
Our dogs love them and great treats !,4
"If your pooch is a heavy chewer, skip this toy. Rope chewed threw in about 10 minutes.",2
I have say ithat is better than I imagined.  I have other people walk my dog also and they love it to.  It was money well spent.  Being able to stop her immediately has made a huge difference around her four and two legged friends.,5
"Love this training gadget. Am a professional trainer, and I find it to be a really valuable tool!  I gave it only 4 stars due to the fact that it seems to jam more often than it should...like several times per training session.  :(  But, for the good it's doing otherwise, I give it a really good rating.",4
"Our dog Rusty, gives these no stuffing toys all paws up.  I've purchased no stuffing toys locally and Rusty usually chews a hole in them and works to turn them inside out.  However with ZippyPaws Skinny Peltz toys he's yet to chew a hole in the first toy given to him several months ago.  He's still on the first of the three given to him a couple of months ago.",5
"The glass design looks nice, doesn't look cheap like other plastic-made drop checkers. Easy to set up and read.

I don't have any way to verify the accuracy, but I can say that my CO2 injected tank reads yellow, and my non CO2 injected tank reads green, so there is certainly a correlation between color reading and CO2 level.",5
"Cats don't eat it. I read the ingredients, it has nice ingredients. But it is waste of money if your cats don't eat it.",3
My 7 pound chihuahua mix loves this sweater. Very well made and soooo warm!!!,5
It works for all 3 of my small dogs.,4
"I got the collar to train my dogs not to chase my pet sheep.  It worked great once I figured it out.  The problem I had at first was I didn't know you have to hold the correction buttons down for a second before it shocks.  The beep comes first, then a second later the shock comes but only if you're still holding the button down.  Practice on the test piece it comes with to get familiar with it before using it on the dog.  The only other issue is that the receiver is very bulky for my smaller dog.  I got the ""Lap Dog Trainer"" for him and that was a much more appropriate size.  With either collar you need to have the collar on TIGHT.  The instructions show to put the receiver right under the dog's throat.  I found that at the tightness the collar needs to be at, it was too uncomfortable.  My dogs wear it on the side or back of their necks and it works fine.",5
"My cat and kitten loved it, until it broker 10 minutes later  :(  The base needs to be heavier or else it'sknocked over with one paw swat",3
"Great, durable dog toy.",5
I followed the instructions and now they are on the food full time. The one thing I have noticed is that my balding dog is getting little hairs growing in the bald spots. Also her coat is super shiny!  I'm continuing this diet for more improvements.,5
"Purrz is ancient, frail, skinny, and picky, so it was to my shock that he's so fond of this food. In fact, I'm saving the rest of the bag for his eating only! Nobody has had dairrhea from it either. Purrz says all paws up for this Iams!",5
"my fish love these (well, they eat them!)",5
"My service dog loves this food and never leaves his bowl without finishing it! and I love that I can get it on amazon for about 10$ LESS than at petco or petsmart(& save gas and my BACK having it delivered)! if you care about your dog you will spend a little more, because then you don't have to feed them as much because they get their nutrients with WELLNESS! I just wish I could use my coupons on amazon!",5
"My rabbit Cowboy is in heaven with this tunnel. This is his first tunnel experience and I have to say that he's really loving it. I was a bit worried that he might not like the crackle because most of his favorite toys don't make any noise at all. I just assumed that he would not like it, but I was wrong he doesn't mind at all. Cowboy is a very weird rabbit he acts more like a cross between a cat and dog rather then a rabbit. As with all of our animals Cowboy was a recue he was in a very small cage and used as a stud until he no long was able to preform. He was brought to the feed store that I worked at by a young man that did not want his ""owners"" to kill him. After getting the ok from the owners he became part of our crazy zoo family. He had never had toys or knew how to play, but he came around fast. I like for him to have lots for places that he can go and hide if he needs to as it can still be over welling at times given his history. This tunnel is great for just that! I like that it can be easily cleaned with a wet rag on the inside and out. It also has a dangle ball that he loves to push with his nose, so cute. The middle of the tunnel has a open circle that can be used as peak a boo game for interacting with him. This is longer then I had pictured in my head but not overly long and doesn't take up much room. The wires are sewed into a strap that keeps them in place and makes it easy to fold flat for storage or to take along. This is a fun tunnel that can be used for lots of pets and my Cowboy recommends it for rabbits.
I check back often for questions, so please feel free to ask anything that I missed and your wondering about this product.
I received Prosper Pet Cat Tunnel - Crackle Play Toy - Collapsible Chute Fun for Rabbits, Kittens, and Dogs at discount or for free for my honest and unbiased review. That has not swayed my review in any, way my review is 100% my own experience with this product.",5
"Cat did not seem interested in eating these. Fortunately, she survived the 6-hour car trip unsedated.",2
"I purchased this for my leopard gecko. It arrived broken, leaving a sharp edge. I used hot glue to put it back together and it worked for a little while, but eventually broke again. I ended up putting it in my 90-gal fish aquarium (with the broken edge buried in the gravel). It serves no purpose, but it does look nice with the rest of the decor.",2
great,5
"Heavy duty.  Works well, and great price.",5
"My dog is in treat HEAVEN. She will put her head on the armrest of my husband's easy chair to beg him to give her more.  When he tries to toss them to me, the intercepts them in mid-air better than Troy Polamalu of the Steelers!!!!",5
Cute,5
"We have a pit bull/plott hound mix who is very high energy and would probably drive us completely insane if it were not for the jolly egg.  She chases it around the yard like a nut and absolutely loves it.  Our other two dogs (also pit or pit mix) have absolutely no interest in the egg at all which actually works out pretty well for us since that means there are not squabbles over it. ;)  She is on her second egg now, the first one eventually started to crack at the seem a bit but it went through at least two years of daily rough use before it started to show that kind of wear.  As long as we are blessed to have that dog, we will always have a jolly egg, worth every penny.",5
"My 12 year old rescue LOVES THIS SENIOR MEDLEY!!!!!
I am sad that I am having a difficult time finding it for ordering more!.,
She will also eat Grammy Pot Pie, but the senior medley has the nutrients and she prefers the taste......
My dog approves this message!",4
"Tommy loves Wellness and he really enjoyed this flavor. I always buy it in the bulk (30lbs) and he didn't complain once. He actually enjoyed it so much, he whined everytime dinner was coming up!",5

I have to admit, I really like it too since unlike something like a Buster cube it's not noisy, doesn't hard my wood floors, and when my dog brings it to me and drops it on my foot it doesn't hurt as much as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everlasting-Treat-Ball/dp/B0012V1G0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everlasting Treat Ball</a>. I'm not sure I'd use this with a dog that really chews on their toys, but for my sheltie it is just ideal. The trick is simply finding the right treats to put into it. Kibble works if it's not too small but my personal favorite is any of the varieties of dried treats like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dogswell-Chicken-Treats/dp/B00066CRXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dogswell Chicken Treats</a>. I just break them up into pieces of varying sizes and stuff them into the ball. The smaller ones come out quickly, and the larger ones, well, they may not come out for a long time, and my dog will often just lick and try to chew them out (obviously don't do this unless you have a dog that is not going to chew the toy itself up!) It keeps him occupied for hours! He's even learned to bring it to me for refills or sometimes just to ask me to have pity on him and get that last treat out for him. I use the toy in many situations when he is fearful or scared, as it's so rewarding for him, that he will interact with it regardless of what else is going on. What else can I say, we BOTH love it! I bought 4 of them, so no matter how many get lost under chairs or beds, I always have one handy to fill up for him, and I always take one with me when we travel.",5
"This has a nice thick cover on top.  Quite a sturdy product.  I started off by rating it a five star product. The last few weeks have been a bit wet and muggy with a lot of thunderstorms.  I am seeing a slight build up of rust on the metal clips at the end of the cable.  Given that this product is meant for the outdoors, the clips should be rust resistant.  I will keep an eye on this over the next few weeks and update my review.",4
"We originally got this for our puppy, but he ended up getting ran over, to our horror. Our other 2 dogs are larger and older, so this food isn't really for their size. I mixed it in with their other food, though, so it wouldn't go to waste. The pieces are much smaller than they are used to, so that may be why they didn't overly care for it. They still ate it, but not as quickly or enthusiastically as their regular food.

For puppies, though, this appears to be a good food.

The first several ingredients are: Lamb, Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Meal, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Fish Meal, Dried Egg Product, Lamb Meal, Dried Beet Pulp, Chicken Fat",4
"Really helped slow down my dog, she use to inhale her food. She still finishes before my other dog who has a regular bowl but only by 10 to 15 seconds, she use to be done a full minute before her",5
Dog loves it.  Wish it had an off button,5
"I read the reviews before buying this, and the high price scared me a little....but know I see why it is priced like it is.  This thing is awesome.  My cat took right to it.  I was scared that this thing was going to be cheesy but it is built to withstand my monster of a cat for a long time.  Built well and is extra tall so my cat can stretch up on it.  It has GREAT hints printed on the bottom.  I loved it so much I bought another one!  The biggest PLUS on this scratch post is this company has found the correct material.  The cats love it.  IT is not that cardboard crap.  It is some type of high density carpet that is designed just for cats.  Congratulations to this company for figuring it out.  DO NOT hesitate buying this.",5
"My Autumn is a power-chewer, and although it took her a while to warm up to this thing, she now loves it - it keeps her busy for hours!  We've had it for quite a few months now and although the ends are a bit ratty looking there's still a lot of use left in it - well worth the money.",5
"Tried this collar after a suggestion from a friend and reading lots of postive reviews here.  My puppy was 3 months old when we started this.  There's a DVD that goes over how to fit and train your dog to use the collar.  My pup wasn't distracted by treats, etc. and would constantly rub her face along the grass when going on walks.  Sadly, even with the padding on the nose side, she still ended up with numerous patches of missing fur on her nose.  Although it did prevent the pulling (hence, more than 1 star) that she does with a regular collar/leash, it's hard to keep using it when she's missing fur as a result. :(",2
Made in the USA canine treats that your pup will love! Well packaged and prompt delivery. My pup's have enjoyed them for years and look forward to them at 'treat' time! Easily broken in half for smaller canines or even quarters.,5
Well designed casing a little to rough for my Yorkshire the bristles are made of wire think the wires should be made a little better they look like needles and it hurts my Yorkshire,3
"Our 55 pound dog demolished this on the first day. For what it cost, it should have held up a lot longer. Not worth the price, you can do better at a dollar store.",2
"MY DOG LOVED THESE. YES, I WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND TO MY FELLOW DOG LOVERS. I DID BREAK IT APART, WOULDN'T GIVE HIM ENTIRE PIECE",5
"Love this,  works like a furminator. And we can use it on both our golden retriever and pit bull. Love how it has a push to clean button.",5
My cat likes it.  Quite too.,5
"Health snack. Dental treat for dogs .they love this stuff. I cut medium or large. This pack is huge 35 sn

Didn't realize this was a bit harder plastic feathers cats don't like it,2
"It is great as a starter tank! I have never had one before so it is a learning experience. I needed to buy a heater, air pump, thermometer, and all the decor.",5
"Smells delicious! Whitens, moisturizes, and (according to my clients) it makes them the smoothest they have ever been! What's not to love? It is the only conditioner I carry.",5
Its great for walks! Love it bc I don't have to throw away the excess water that they don't finish and since it is a combo it has shortened the number of stuff I need to bring on a hike with the dogs.,5
Great price on wee-wee pads.  Not much to say about them except they're cheaper than the local store and the puppies use them.,5
"Used it as a hut and was really happy with it, my chin loves it.",5
"It does work. Unfortunately my cats do not seem to like its smell.  This makes me unsure how to rate it.  I am giving it three stars.  If you have a cat who will use scented litter, you might consider this a five star product.  My cats will not use scented litter, BTW.",3
"Great quality and the perfect length!  It doesn't tangle like my thinner, longer leash.",5
My dogs could eat these for every meal.,5
My cats love it and the emery works to keep nails in check.,5
my kittens go nut's for this toy,5
"Always searching for a good chew to keep my puppy busy when I work I gave these a try.
They are quite small, she ate the whole thing in three bites,aside the fact that defeat the purpose of keeping her busy, I just got worry about the large pieces getting stuck or not properly digested,so i decided not to give her the second one.
For reference my dog is a 6 month Labrador over 50 pounds, so maybe these chews will be just fine for smaller dogs.",3

"This review does not have anything to do with the seller.  I tried this Nut Knob and my bunnies just did not play nor interactive with this product.  Every bunny has different tastes so I hope when you purchase this product, your bunny enjoys!",2
My dogs love them.  We split them in half because they are both small.,5
My son's cat is crazy for this toy!  It keeps him entertained and I love that!,5
"This video was taken with no background noise and with the tank at full level.  If the level drops, the noise gets about 5x louder.

I am very satisfied with this product.  It's keeping my 12 gallon tank very clean and I only replace the filter every 2 weeks.  So it's like $40 a year for the filters.

I have had this for a few months and it's running just perfectly.  Read the instructions!!",5
This is the only canned cat food my cats will eat.  For some reason they only like this flavor.  We go through quite a few cans a week.,5
"My cats like, and I like it because it clumps up fast so it is easily cleaned and it reduces urine odor well.  The only con is that this product produces a very fine dust that requires daily dusting with a damp paper or cloth towel-but that can be said about every cat litter sold today so it gets five stars.",5
"I have loved these Nerf Flying Disks in the past.  They have flown great, however this one is unbalanced and always lands ""crashing down"" vs. gliding.  It is not a problem with my throwing it because everyone who tries it has the same crash landing therefore I am confident that it is defective.  I will not bother to return due to postage, however I am sad to say that I will not buy this product again.",1
"I have a cat that suffers from a lot of GI problems and this product seems to be the only thing that helps him out.  I have tried a lot of other supplements, but putting a packet in his food once a day seems to relieve him from his GI symptoms.  He can be a picky eater, but he does not mind the taste of this supplement.  In addition, his coat has become more healthy looking.",5
"I bought this along with the other two toys in the carnival theme. My parakeet uses all three! He really does move the ""mallet"" around, I know because I often find it other positions, and I've seen him do it. He uses both his beak and his foot to lift and swivel it.

Parakeets LOVE their mirrors, and this mirror is kept further away from him because of the moles and hammer in front of it. So, its not his favorite mirror, but its enough to get his interest peaked.

The moles do NOT go up and down--that isn't made clear in the description. That part is added to entice us humans to buy it. LOL  They're useless to the bird, but the mallet and mirror makes him supper happy. That's all I care. The mallet is hollow on the bottom, so it appears to ""squish"" the moles down when its really just covering them.

I recommend this because my bird goes bird-crazy over it, and its very cute when my friends and family visit.

One problem, though: the mallet came broken! It is packaged poorly--it is attached only to a flat cardboard card with no protection for all that sticks out, namely the mallet mechanism! It came broke in several pieces, but fortunately, I figured out how they went back together and superglued them. Because someone else has already mentioned this, I can't give this five stars.",4
My cat is 16 now so this is the best food for her. I supplement her with canned food but I leave down her Iames all the time and she nibbles on it daily.,5
"good and clean condition, no dirt, dust, filth, huge scratch, rip or damage on package and the product. I'm very pleased and satisfied.",5
The pate is a pretty good consistency.  I used to feed this to my cats before I switched them to a grain-free diet.,3
My dog Jack was so excited about this toy. He still plays with all of them every so often. They are easy to carry in his mouth and squeek at the same time.,5
"Really a nice, clean, neat, simple-to-use skimmer. It works very well. Seller was very prompt and courteous to provide a missing part. Skimmer was easy to install and operate, using the easy-to-follow pictorial that was emailed upon request. It's quiet and I like being able to see the bubbling action through the clear acrylic body. Would definitely recommend for the sumpless tanks out there. Works almost identically to higher priced hang-on skimmers on the market and less than half the price. Very impressive.",4
"for my groom tool kit.  So far, I have not needed it, but the time will definitely come.  It will be just the ticket!",5
"These will last forever with a small dog. My dog loves them and they don't make her stink... if you know what I'm saying. I give her a few each day and for the price, you won't find better.",5
"These are great for restraining my toy poodle puppy (that would nearly jump out the window when something caught his eye).  He didn't appreciate being belted at all though, especially when I only attached just the 1, so I ended up using both of them to give him some mobility.  So after belting him for a week, I took him for a ride and he had perfect car behavior, sat in his seat and barely moved.  For me, these were probably a good training aid since now my dog behaves well to keep from being belted.",5
My dogs love these treats!,5
"Didn't work on my pug....AT ALL!!!!
I hear it works on some dogs.  Not mine.",1
"Was really excited about getting this heat bulb for my snakes, so the light did not shine into my bedroom at night. Go to plug in and it does not work. Shook the bulb to see if I could hear any raddling and nothing. The darn thing should have worked, but doesn't!  What a waste of money. I guess I'll just go buy it from a pet store around my house instead.",1
I have two cats who are very fussy and appreciate when their drinking water is clear and filtered.  This product really does the job.  I will continue to purchase these for my Drinkwell Fountain.,5
"Excellent product, my small aged dogs love the soft baked treats as next to no teeth makes it difficult to eat crunchy biscuits. Great product",5
"Seems to help my 11 year old Siberian husky and his arthritis in his hips.  Much better and cheaper alternative to dog aspirin, I also give glucosamine/MSM in additional to this.",4
Works great,5
Can't beat these for the money. Very accurate. Better than the annoying floating glass thermometers that are difficult to read or suction cup fails and end up jammed in the corner behind a powerhead in your aquarium. I put a couple of them in my 120 gallon. Great for discovery cold spots in larger tanks. All 3 of mine work good and are very accurate. Highly recommend.,5
My dogs are enjoying these treats.,5
"This is the absolute best thing I have ever discovered on amazon! I'm still in shock, it's been 4 months and we're only half way through!",5
"My cats like the food, and it seems to be tolerated well by the one cat with the food sensitivities.  My only complaint is that they don't offer it in larger bags.  Many households, like mine, have more than one cat.  I have to order a new bag every week.  Now that Amazon upped their free shipping minimum, I may just be making a trip to the pet store every week instead.",4
"Impossible to clean, and the texture confused my cat into thinking it was a place to pee. Horrible horrible waste of money.",1
Very good,5
"Part of an attachment came broken.  We fixed the part, hopefully it holds.",3
"Took a minute for ur Bird to trust it, but he likes it.  When he feels like hanging out on a perch this one is great!  He's a bit spoiled and only wants his own cage or one of us.",5
Dogs love them...,5
Unable to use since there was no clasp where you put it around the dogs nose to secure. Unhappy.,1
"Hoping for the best with these hip and joint support pills for my 100+ lbs. shepherd. These are chewable tablets - beef flavor - that is recommended to take 2 tablets twice a day for the first 4-6 weeks, then it can be reduced to only two tablets per day. He had no problems eating them after some sniffing. Getting him to eat them was the biggest part.",4
"The pooch that I got these for , loved them !",5
"Awesome price, cant beat it. Buy it here",5
Is gentle enough to use on a small kitten and smells great too!,5
"I had a bit of a time getting small enough booties for my  little rat terrier. These do fit. I feel that they are somewhat thin and flimsy and wonder how they will hold up over time, but after a couple months we are still finding them serviceable. I wish that the Velcro hook portion were a bit longer in order to grab the loop when fastening...

For the money paid, I guess I would say that I am  satisfied with this purchase.",3
"These are perfect for helping my dogs keep their teeth clean, plus it gives them something to do for an hour or so.",5
"This Kong bear was pretty good, as it had rope knots in the toy, and it took my dog at least a couple of hours to destroy it. Unfortunately, for the price it was not a great value in terms of doggie entertainment. Once my dog rips a toy apart and chews up the sound bubble, she just walks over the toy as if it did not exist.

So even though I was fascinated with the bear, my dog was only fascinated until she ripped its heart out.",5
"This is well made and our dog has enjoyed it a lot! When time is tight, this can be a great way to wear your dog out. Also great for basic obedience training.",4
"One of the difficult things about reviewing dog food is whether or not your dog will love it.  In the case of our pug, Gus, he has shown love/disklike towards this dog food.  Day one, he loved it.  Day two, he didn't want anything to do with it.  A few days later, he scarfed it down.  So, my dog was quite finicky when it came to this puppy food.

But for dog owners who are looking for safe dog food, Under the Sun promotes their puppy food as far-fresh ingredients, quality ingredients with no corn, wheat and soy and they also skip chicken by-product meals.  Their food is potato free and only utilizes single animal proteins.

If there is one caveat, it would be the price.

But considering cheaper alternatives and what is in their food, you pay a little more for the quality.

If you are on a budget, the price of this dog food may make you turn your head, but if you are a dog lover and want quality ingredients, you may give this dog food a try.",4
"I think the food is great - my dog, not so much.",4
Finally found a hay my 3 buns love! You can just see & smell the difference in this hay! Tried at least a few other brands & compared to this they were old & dried.,5
It is the perfect way to take care of the Litter Maid.  Perfect.,5
"My cats are crazy over temptations, they hare the lid opening and come running.",5
Repeat buyer. Dogs love these . They look so good humans want to eat them too!,5
"They do what they're supposed to do.  I'm on my 4th box of 1,000 and haven't had any failures at all.",5
"This item is fake!!!! It is not genuine. Do NOT purchase from this seller. I have another EZ-Walk Harness and although it came in the correct packaging, the seams are loose and there are no logos. I will not even put this on my reactive Great Dane knowing he could easily break it and run off!",1
"Big and roomy. This is big, sturdy and perfect for my lazy dog.",5
"I have 5 cats and they all seem to like this food.  I put out dry food at night for snacking and it helps with their not being so hungry in the morning.  So far, I don't see that anyone is throwing up from it.  It is also on the truth about pet food list.  It is made with no GMO which is a big plus.  I got the low grain and grain free both and they seem to like them equally.",5
"This is the third one I've bought so that must tell you that we keep coming back.  Unfortunately, a couple times we've left the harness on when we chained our dog up while camping and he chewed through it - twice - our stupid fault!  Anyway, this thing is easy to put on and keeps out pit mix in control without choking him.",5
My 3 cats loved it and played with it.  They sat around waiting for it to be turned on.  The plastic wand snapped off within 2 wks though.,1
"We love this harness!

My wife looked and looked for a no pull harness that was small enough for our puppy. She couldn't find anything with the latch in the front of the chest, but she found this. It's much easier to use than our pups previous harness! She also likes it much better! She is only 10lb but she pulls with all her might (which we're working on) we were expecting more since it states it's a no pull but no miracles she needs training and time.",4
"I purchased one of these to send to the person I was getting my puppy from, so that she could include it in the pen with the puppies while I was waiting for him to be ready for adoption.  All of the little ones loved it, and it really helped with the adjustment to the new home, as it smelled like his litter-mates, his mom, and his first human mommy.  I had gotten one of these for my Corgi as well and she still plays with hers, years later.  It is well made and can withstand a lot of abuse from little puppy teeth.",5
Our dog did not really care for these.,3
"I wish they would have lasted a little longer.  My young German Shepard went through them in 1 day.  I know nothing will last forever, but they should have lasted more than a day.",4
"I purchased this as an added supplement as one of my ferrets became depressed and stopped eating.  While I was hand feeding him to help him gain weight, I wanted to ensure that he was getting the proper amount of nutrients that he needed from his standard diet.  Quite frankly, I can't tell if this particular product made any difference in his recovery.

It is fairly easy to work with, it is in liquid form and is to be added directly to water.  It is yellow in color and has no scent, so I don't believe it would have any odd flavor that would deter ferrets.  I don't like the fact that is states you should make their water fresh every day.  While my ferrets drink a lot of water, they have two water bottles that are full at all times and it's inconvenient to have to dump it every morning and make it fresh.  Personally, I would have preferred a vitamin that could be added directly to a food supplement, especially since I was focused on one particular ferrets recovery.",3
Gets the job done . Has sent to it not good .looks like shredded tp and acts like it guinea pigs hair had uncheck to it,2
"I purchased this to hang a canary cage. The cage is small with just one bird in it.

I saw some reviews saying the stand was flimsy. I have to argue. It's actually pretty well constructed in my opinion. I think people overestimate how much weight it can handle. I can't imagine anything bigger than a finch or canary cage would work well!

Yes, the cage will swag if you touch it. But that's common sense when hanging a cage. Even with the occasional bump from the dog, this has never even looked like it was going to collapse or tip over.

I love the look of a hanging cage and this did the trick. Bird and I are both happy!",5
"Very nice chew toy for puppies. So far, this toy has been able to withstand the abuse and needle sharp teeth of our little puppy. Hope it lasts.",5
dogs like it. can't comment more,5
"We were not certain that this fit our water fountain.  It did.  Now that I know that it fits, I will be ordering more next time.",4
Works fine. The light picks up everything so be ready to examine each and every mark and stain to rule out bugs etc.,3
Mutt Mitts are the only bag I'll use when walking by bigger dogs. The double ply thickness is great when cleaning up after my Lab.,5
This balances my dog's digestive system. Dramatic difference since we started. Fantastic!,5
GREAT PRODUCT,5
"One of my Basenji's favorite Christmas gifts.  She is pretty destructive with toys, but so far this mallard is holding up very well.",5
This is amazing!! Only thing that has lasted with my 80lb German Shepherd. She chews constantly and this has held up the best by far! She can normally destroy things in just a day or two and this is the amount of damage she's done in A MONTH. Would definitely recommend.,5
"The cats love this and try to rip it open while it's still in the package.  The little toy that comes with it is a big hit and the catnip is loved by all.  The cats use it all the time, rather than the furniture, which is a blessing.  This is the third one we've ordered and will order more, for sure.",5
"Just like with all chuckit toys, I love it. I love how there is a variety. I've used the glow in the dark one in the dark with my retriever and he seemed to really enjoy it. One word of warning... if you have a dog that loves water, do not use the balls with holes in them unless there are no bodies of water nearby. My golden would play fetch and get hot so he'd go to the pond for a swim and a drink, of course taking his beloved ball with him... he sometimes would drop the ball in the water and we only ever managed to find one that he lost in there. Otherwise, these are excellent... they fly far, they bounce high, and they are indestructible to a dog that is very destructive of his toys!",5
cat likes it,5
"I am still overwhelmed about how wonderful this filter works. I have a 125gal aquarium, but my fish weigh over 15 pounds and you can imagine what type of waste they put out! I had a lesser filter that was supposed to be big enough to work, but this filter keeps my tanke crystal clear and is super easy to clean and replace filters, etc. LOVE IT",5
True to size.  Holds up well in the washer and dryer.  Love the ring on top-- eliminates the hassle of putting on a harness.  I bought 2!,5
I wanted this to work but it did NOTHING to stop my 2 little dogs from barking. They didn't even pause a second when I pressed the button.,1
"These are some of the best mineral rocks. I had purchased a snail with holes and a crack in her shell because I knew she would die if left at the pet store. 2 weeks later, she's doing well. Most of the holes have shrank in size, and the crack is sealing nicely. Will definitely buy again.",5
My Min Pin loves this! It is well made & fairly easy to secure into my 2008 Altima. I have a happy pooch now for sure!,5
I have given my anxious dog the recommended dosage and have seen no change in their behavior. I wouldn't buy again.,1
Kitties like but a little messy,4
"It was this or buy a whole new filter. To bad they cant make a more reliable product.
Who designs so much junk.",2
"We adopted our pup, Molly, as an adult from the local Humane Society. Everyone we meet asks what type of dog she is, and when we say we don't know, the immediate response is always ""You know they make DNA tests now that can figure that out!"" Finally we got around to actually getting one. I was so excited to try it out! We had lots of guesses about what she might be, and every new person wanted to give us their input. We had about 5 or 6 breeds that we suspected could be in the mix, but were very open to other options.

Instructions seemed very straightforward. Make sure your dog doesn't eat or drink anything within 2-3 hours before the test. To make sure our pup didn't, we did the test first thing in the morning after she had been crated all night, no food or water or chew toys. You swab the inside of their mouth with these two swabs for 15 seconds each and then put them back in the plastic wrap. Molly is incredibly patient, I think this part would be extremely difficult with a puppy or an impatient dog. When you register the test online, it asks for the dog's name, estimated date of birth, and weight. I was hesitant to put in Molly's weight because I worried it would influence the results, but ultimately I decided to include it.

Turnaround was much quicker than expected. The sample arrived at the lab on 6/16 and we got the results at 11pm on 6/24. It says she's mostly golden retriever - which is not even CLOSE to the breeds that the shelter, our vet, or anyone we've ever encountered has suggested. There is nothing golden retriever about her appearance, behavior, or personality. I find it incredibly hard to believe that she is a large percentage golden. I think that golden retriever was probably just a wild guess based on her weight and the predominance of that breed in the U.S., particularly in Minnesota (our dog, by the way, is from Missouri - not sure if goldens are as common there as they are in Minnesota). I honestly would rather have gotten a result that just said ""mixed breed"" without more specifics, because we know she's not a golden retriever. There are probably 50 breeds that I would find more believable than golden retriever, looking at our pup. At this point, I think the test is probably mostly bunk.

The only reason I gave this product two stars instead of one is because it DID detect that she is 1/8 Great Pyrenees. That is one of the breeds that the shelter IDed, and it was one that we were fairly confident about.",2
These are so nice for medium to large dogs and even big cats.  I put the dishes in the dishwasher.  Our dog just passed away and this helped him.  He was 17 years old and blind and deaf - so this helped him to find it and not walk into his food and water.  Gave it to a friend of ours now and she said it helped her dog because he would get choked easy bending over his bowl on floor.,5
My 5 year golden loves them but they are hard. If i had a small dog who needed half you couldn't split them. Thats the only downfall. The vet carries them and they are soft so i will probably pay they extra money and get it from them.,3
"Puppia is a good company, which is why I purchased this harness for my 20 lb. Boston Terrier. I liked that the sizing was adjustable. Following the company's size chart, I purchased the large. Unfortunately, the harness fit my dog in the chest, but the waist strap was HUGE on him, even at the smallest/tightest size. Going to a smaller size isn't an option, because then the chest part won't fit him. I guess Bostons are just oddly shaped (with broad chests and trim waists), but this product didn't work for us and was returned.",3
Cat loves it and that's good enough for me.,4
"I mean, come ON. How cute IS this thing?
My dog is usually fairly indifferent about toys, or at least, she's an equal-opportunity-toy-destroyer. But it's pretty clear she LOVES this one, and it seems pretty durable so far, in that its squeak has lasted WELL past the usual five milliseconds. So. WIN. Would buy again.",5
"Love this deshedding tool. My cat was dropping hair everywhere due to the change of season and this brush has eliminating about 85% of that. It also works great on the dogs, too. Would buy it again and highly recommend.",5
Perfect size for our growing puppy.  He doesn't mind going on here at all.  Made of high quality metal.,5
"Great fit, easy to put on my dog, nice color.",5
Dog loves it.,5
Made the cats sick. Had to discontinue using this food.,2
Great all natural freeze dried dog food. Been using ZiwiPeak for years and it has made a huge difference in my dogs health.,5
My friend loved using this to correct her undisciplined bichon. The only problem was when she corrected him she scared a dog that he was with. We found that a can of compressed air (from stationary store works just as well),5
"My kitties figured this out quickly.  I got rid of the gray ""mat"" that went around the bottom of it - they kept knocking it off the ""center"" hole and over it would go.  They are not knocking it over as much now that I removed the mat.  I always put a handful of treats in it when leaving the house - it's always empty when I get back!  Only reason it did not get five stars is that it needs, IMO, a heavier base....",4
Worth the money.  No more suction cups losing their suction over time.  I use it for my ph probe.,5
"Great light, works just as good as the light I paid three times as much for.",4
It kinda smells weird and my kitty isn't thrilled with it.,3
These fit perfectly in the Kong Wobbler toy and my dog LOVES them! They are also small enough that you could use them for training treats if needed.,5
It took awhile for my pet to adjust to using.  I started by putting on my finger and then the tool.  My pet is only 3lbs. I believe that at first he may have been afraid of the size.  So I'm introducing him slowly. If you could make the tool a little smaller it may be helpful for smaller dogs.,4
"Waste of money. My cat ripped the bag to shreds. They were also huge and really too big for our litter box (which is not a small box). Basically a glorified garbage bag that is flatter...I would not buy again. Sifting was a joke, it didn't work, there were not enough holes and they were not placed far enough apart. No thank you.",1
"This was a little bit pricey, but then again, no store in my area stocks it, so I otherwise have to drive over an hour to get it so I guess it evens out. I would order it again.",5
"Wellness makes great pet food, and these treats are a good example of it. They're not just for small dogs, by the way. My dog is big (as in big and with a tendency to being overweight), and small treats are superb for a dog with a weight problem. You can use them for training and for keeping weight issues in control.

The price for these is also reasonable. I thoroughly recommend them for small pups and for bigger ones who need a treat that's calorie-conscious.",5
"First of all, I have to say - this is a fabulous product!! I bought 2 for my naked, sphynx cats and they love to bask in the sun and watch the birds and squirrels in the window with these sills. So, I'm very happy I bought them.

However... I was up all night with one of my kitties because she's chewed one of the protected zipper covers and ingested it, so she was throwing up and has severe diarrhea. Thankfully, the ingested piece came out and that's how I knew what happened. Sorry for the graphic story. I ended up tearing off the rest of the rubber covers for the zippers so hopefully that solves the problem for the future.

Just beware if purchasing this and your cat's a chewer. Apparently mine is.",4
"I've had all 4 of my dogs on Frontline Plus as long as I have had them. I've never had a flea problem and rarely if ever find ticks on them. I am a Vet Tech and at our office we don't sell Frontline anymore as people were complaining  that it wasn't working, but I personally have never had a problem and am very happy with it.",5
Can't go wrong with a KONG!!,5
Masks symptoms not clears up. Use curaseb shampoo to actually fix the itch.,1
Honestly thank goodness this does not cost a bundle of money. All this did with my puppy was make a total mess - he starting digging his paws into the grass down to the soil - which only made a bulk of dirt / soil into his paws and nails - plus since it's placed in a cardboard box - puppy loved to chew the box - total waste,1
"My African Grey Parrot loves these treats, plus they are very good for her in supplementing her regular diet.",5
"I've had my dogs on this diet for about 8 months, and instead of losing weight, they are gaining.  They only get 2/3 cup, which should not be enough to make them gain weight.  They get no treats.",2
I have two 40-50lb dogs who love to chew on toys. They also love treats. I was hoping these would be bigger/more durable but they literally devour one of these in 2 minutes or so.,3
"very light. and did go down to bottom finially,, I am not real sure yet if I like",3
I bought this dog house in June of last year and the roof is already bowing in. I bought this to last and now I have to purchase a new dog house for my Dog!,1
"This is a heavy duty dog bed I bought after my dog suffered a spinal injury and needed extended crate rest.  I have had it 4 months and it is holding up nicely, continuing to offer my dog comfort and support.",5
"Very cute, fit my dog just right which sometimes is not that easy to find a good fit. he is a larger boston.",5
"Our new 10wk old german shepherd/border collie puppies love this toy!  Perfect size for them.  They haven't started destroying toys yet, but are enjoying chasing/chewing.",5
My cat seems to be doing well on this food.  She is very finicky and throws up a lot.  So far this food has not caused her problems and she gobbles it up.,4
"Great pet carrier, very roomy and the cats seem to really like it so far. Might wear down over time but overall seems like a great product.",5
great,4
"My cat loves it, yes i said cat.",5
"I bought this for my 6lb bunny. It does fit and could be made bigger, but not much smaller. A little flimsy and hard to get on if you have a very active fast rabbit like mine. However, it does work fine and my bunny has never gotten loose.",3
"Awesome!!!! My puppy loves this jacket, he wears it and doesn't want to take it off....he looks great in it and he gets lots of compliments...thanks!!!!",5
"I bought this for my 4.5 month lab puppy, and she likes it a lot! It is durable, so I don't worry if I she has it and need to make dinner or whatnot, like I have to with soft toys. Half a milk bone fits inside and she likes trying to get it out. Good product for the price!",5
The pump doesnt pump and comes off easily.,1
"The machine is a bit loud, but the cats LOVE it. The laser is strong so we can use it in the day, versus a cheap laser. The hear the machine starting and they run downstairs. My friend brought her 4 year old over, and he loved it almost as much as the kitties! I have 4 cats, and 3 of them love it, the other is our older cat who likes different toys. Batteries didn't last long in this, but we used it a lot. It's a great price, if this one broke (already been dropped twice and perfectly fine) I would happily buy again.",5
fish getting more color than needed. clouds water,2
Great carbon filter. They fit well and do a good job of keeping the water clear and clean.,4
"Love all Lupine products! The only problem with the larger leash is the clip can come undone if your dog is rolling around on the ground, etc.",5
"Overall, this Tie-Out stake did its job. It held our growing puppy in the yard while we got the invisible fence installed. It was very easy to install.

I did deduct one star because when we removed it (we had only used it a month and only when we were outside with the dog), it was severely bent. However, it was still securely in the ground, so I am only deducting one star. Our puppy weighed around 50 lbs. when we were using it, so we were surprised she was able to bend it (she is now 10 months old and 70 lbs., not the 40 lbs. everyone at the rescue shelter said would be her maximum weight). Admittedly, she is a big puppy, but I still didn't think the amount of force she put on it should have caused it to bend quite that easily.",4
"Came quickly and in good shape. I have a little 9 lb. dog & collar fits. I don't think I would use it on any smaller dog because even though this is for small dogs it would be a little big for them. Have to cut off the end though, don't cut the end with the antenna in it though. Has good range and lots of power if you need it. Almost electrocuted myself on high power to test it. The kit does come with a light to test it which I was to smart to use. I've used it on low setting on #2 and it gets attention quickly.",5
"I run a dog rescue and they thrive on this food. I also have 4 dogs, all ages and sizes that love the food. All I change are the flavors.",5
I can't get them to let me even put it in their mouths.,1
in my dog's dinner.  My vet recommended a more expensive version of fish oil but I believe this is just as effective and so much less expensive.  It does stink so I am careful not to get it on my hands.,5
best flea preventative,5
My puppy loves this toy.  She loves getting the squirrels out of the tree trunk.  The squirrels are holding up to her strong teeth.  The tree trunk isn't holding up very well though.  After a few days she's done some damage to that part of the toy.,4
This only works for 2 weeks.,2
My dogs love these.  Each one gets one ear a day.,5
still have my other two great price,5
"Our Ridgeback is now a reformed puller! Yay! Walking her on this is about 90% better! Fits perfectly, she's 60 pounds and I ordered the large. Very softly lined and really makes her stop once she feels the slight pull on the leash. Great!",5
"I have 4 indoor cats and my boyfriend put the kibosh on getting any more, so I purchased this for the neighborhood strays I like to take care of.  Pretty much none of them have decided to set foot in there but I have a feeling their tunes will change when winter comes.  It looks durable and it was really easy to set up.  My only suggestion is that it definitely needs to be on a porch or set somewhere where it will not blow away because it is very light.",5
Well my dog love is. We call it Crack for dogs. My wife does not like the smell and gags LOL. I think it smells like pork rinds.  We open the bag and he comes running,5
"I bought this for our hyperactive cat to entertain him while we're out. He is food obsessed and very determined, so this toy was a jackpot. He LOVES it and will play with it for an hour or more as long as there are treats inside. He figured it out right away and I did end up covering half the hole with a strip if packing tape for more of a challenge. I wish the tail didn't come off so easily, but he actually loves that as a toy on its own too.",5
"A nice mix of seed, saw many more varieties of birds this season when using this bag. The seed might be a little too good however, as the finches would drain my large feeder in under 24 hours.",5
One for home and one for my nursing bag,5
as described,5
"These 6"" Patriot Bully Sticks truly are odor-free / low-odor. I have ordered several other brands that are not low odor and I gag every time I take one out of the bag. So from now on it's only Patriot for me. To get bully sticks low-odor, the manufacturer has to fully drain the ""stick"" of all fluids before stretching it and dehydrating it. Yep...that means they should totally drain the urine, semen, and blood. Especially the urine. Manufacturers who short cut this step will produce super stinky sticks. If a product doesn't say ""low odor"" or ""odor-free"" it means they didn't drain the sticks and they will have a stench that will make your eyes water.  Regarding size....I have 2 little Maltese dogs. One is 4 lbs and these sticks are a little big for her but she manages. My other Maltese is 8 lbs and this stick is the perfect size for him - both length and circumference. If you have a dog who is larger than 15 lbs I would suggest getting a bigger stick. If you have a really large dog, such as over 40 lbs or so, I think a different type of treat, such as antlers or pigs' ears, would be better. For smaller dogs I would highly recommend these bully sticks!!",5
"I used this on my short haired Doberman dog. I end my brushing with this and also use it on his face and paws. It does shed a bit as others have also noticed but to me it's not a big deal, I just wipe it away.",5
Love Taste of the Wild products,5
"Cosy and warm.  My cat loves his bed and he is cuddled it every day.  After 14 years, he never had a bed and I am sorry I never got him one.  He loves this bed, so I bought two!!!

People have complained that it isn't very solid, but I think it is great.  It's a bed, not a basket.  The sides are very soft, so when your pet lays it's head of the side, it is soft like a pillow.  I have never washed it (I might though) and I have had no problem with the seams or stitching.",5
dogs love this toy!,5
Cute collar,5
"My fatso loves these,  and begs consistently. I indulge her Royal Obeseness because at least it's good for her teeth",5
Great price...our dogs love this food!,5
This is my second Double Dog leash. I have 2 small dogs and 2 med/large dogs. I stayed with Mighty Paws for my second leash due to the good construction.,5
I am writing this review as the cats. The cats love it. It is like cat crack.,5
Mom's cat has diabetes and he just lays in front of it and drinks and plays!,5
Too hard for him to squeak.  Smaller may have worked,2
This is great. It holds a lot of water. Both my dog and my cat enjoy it.,5
"These are really good.  Wish they were just a tad, not much, smaller.",4
My fickel cats love it. Tiki Cat tuna (except for the one with prawns) is the only thing they will eat consistently.,5
"My Jack Russell's goto ball. Indestructible, good crazy bouncing ball.",5
My pug showed improvement within a couple of days.  I will continue to use these drops from no on.,5
"Cats approve, at least my two calicos do.  In fact I'm having to purchase more than I wanted because not only do the cats love it but the birds enjoy it and a, not too shy, squirrel happens by for samples.",5
"When I set this up, and started to use it for the first time, my dogs had no clue what was going on.  I have older dogs, so they are set in their ways and have been babied .

We have used this for a few days, but they are starting to associate the bell with going outside. When I push the button myself, they know its time to go out to potty. I've started taking their paw and pushing the button, and then taking them out, so I think it will just take a little bit of time.

The device itself is pretty neat, it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it, with the directions. It has many different tunes to choose from, and the volume can be adjusted. The paw button, connects very well to the plug in bell. I've always had it work everytime the paw buttons been pushed.

Overall, I am pleased with the results so far. Its been just a few days of using it, and no they aren't pushing the button yet on their own, but they are aware that its time to go outside when they hear it, so they are learning. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, Unbiased review. All opinions are my own.",4
cat loves,5
My dogs don't like the color when they eat them and I don't like it when I pick up after they eat them.,5
"My cat first went for the cascading trough right away. The cool part about its design is that they can't paw stuff out right away. The treats wind up slipping out of their paw and down to the next layer on the cascade. Next she went for the ping pong ball area. The balls were a little scary initially. I took some of the balls out to make her see that there were treats at the bottom, then I added them back in. I put bonito flakes in the cups. They still haven't learned how to use the cups as catapults, but they are at least interested. The little trough in the front works for paste or liquid treats. I suppose that could get a little messy, so I just used dry treats. The directions suggest trying to put water in the back ping pong ball area and floating a ping pong ball or other toy on top for play. I will try that with my kitten when he gets here next month. My cats are on the heavy side, so I'm thinking about putting their meals in here to slow down the eating and to make it more work.",5
"Pill Pockets -- my dog usually got as excited about these as he did for real treats and never refused them!! My dog is ""the world's fussiest dog,"" as my husband describes him, and he needs to take 8 pills twice daily to treat a paw infection, along with his chronic conditions. I was able to get 2 capsules into each Pill Pocket. The bag contains 30 Pill Pockets, so we went through it quickly.

Pill Pockets contain rehydrated chicken, glycerin, wheat flour, vegetable oil, wheat gluten, dried corn syrup, dried cultured skim milk, natural chicken bouillon flavor, natural flavors, sodium bisulfate, xantham gum, mixed tocopherols (preservative). I was hoping he would like something with less processed ingredients, but that didn't happen.

More details: recently, the dog caught onto my tricks -- he sometimes rejects peanut butter and has even become suspicious of cream cheese, so I bought several products to conceal pills. Here is the breakdown of the others:

Pill Yums -- came as a container of 30 ""small"" pieces, which were ~5/8 x 1/2 x 3/8"", although other sizes are available. He ate these 75% of the time, although at first he was reluctant. The country of origin isn't on the package, although Spring Pet Products is in TX. Ingredients: glycerin, corn starch, cheese powder, corn solids, vegetable oil, sucrose, artificial flavoring, caramel color, sorbic acid, calcium proprionate.

Pill Buddy Naturals -- ingredients looked more natural than some other options, but that doesn't matter since he refused them half the time. Made in Canada. These come as 2 attached pieces in a little cellophane-wrapped package, with 15 packages per bag = 30 total (which doesn't last long if your dog takes lots of pills, but would be fine for a pill or 2 per day). Each piece can fit a capsule, or 2 smaller pills (like synthroid + Pepcid) and these are easy to mold around the pills to conceal them. Contains barley flour, chicken, vegetable oil, molasses, whey protein, natural flavors, garlic powder, rosemary extract, xantham gum, citric acid and mixed tocopherols.

Pill Paste by Earth Balance -- he ate this ~75% of the time. It comes in a small container (2.1 oz, 2 1/2"" in diameter, 7/8"" high) so it won't last long, but one nice feature is that you use just enough to coat the pill, so it's flexible for anything from tiny pills to big tablets, and much easier to work than Tomlyn's Pill Masker. Made in USA. Contains wheat flour, corn syrup, vegetable glycerin, vegetable oil, stabilized rice bran, dried pork liver, natural flavor, vegetable lecithin, salt, dried cheese, dried corn syrup, xantham gum, sorbic acid and calcium proprionate.

Pill-Masker by Tomlyn -- a 4 oz. jar of bacon-flavored paste, which again was flexible for hiding tiny pills to big tablets. However, he turned his nose up at this consistently. No country of origin on the label, but Tomlyn is in TX. This is also labeled as appropriate for cats, so if you have to give pills to multiple pets, it may be helpful. Contains Brewers dried yeast, glycerin, lecithin, vegetable oil, salt, spray dried liver powder, cheese powder, natural flavors, arabic gum, sorbic acid (preservative), calcium proprionate (preservative), sodium acid pyrophosphate and Rosemary extract.",5
"it just doesn't work well on my pug who is about 27 lbs.  First I tried the lg and that rubbed the fur raw on his knee joint (back of)  now this x lg  seemed better but started rubbing upper leg by his chest.  also if you have to halt the dog while while walking forward its fine.  However if you halt the dog from in front of him it pulls against his neck and head and tries to come off. One should be careful because a panic stop could potentially injure the dog, in my opinion.
  I am back to his original harness that is a nylon strap type and it works fine.  Here I thought I was giving him better comfort with the puppia.  Note...these things showed up after 2-3 weeks of use.",2
The best buffer because it only raises the Ph without raising the carbonate hardness...,5
Runs very small but quality material!,1
"Item delivered on time, was as described",5
"This is a very well-designed product! The button is large and bright enough that it is easy for pets to notice. The treat compartment behind it for use during training gives pups a good association with it. Best of all, it is not made as a jingle bell on a ribbon or other type of potty bell which a puppy can easily mistake for a new toy to play with. Our puppy uses it only when he has to go potty, using his nose or paw, and otherwise ignores it, which is ideal. The instructions are clear and helpful. We have the chime on a different level of the house than the button itself, and it still works and can be heard from either level (the volume can be changed and the tones are cute and adjustable). It is maybe a tad pricey for a potty chime, but compared to the potty doorbell products out there we've found none better than this. A very satisfactory buy.",5
Superb set of blade guards/combs,5
Very good product,5
cats seem to enjoy it,5
"I have a small size for my Yorkie so I knew I needed a size up for my Cairn Terrier.  This is way big on him, and the small is too small.  We need an inbetween size I guess.  But the quality is great.",3
"Too many hard large pieces (feet, hooves) that my dogs didn't care for.",2
"Puppy loves beef treats, easy to tear Apart and feed for training. Comes in big flat chunks that's you just ripe apart and feed",5
"Actually, my cat loves it.  Good size allows for frequent bunnykicking and is holding up to lots of loving chew time.",5
My dogs love these.,5
This bowl worked great until it started to irritate my french bulldog's face. He started to get red patches of raw skin on his muzzle. Upon closer inspection we realized it was right where his face would hit the bumps in the bowl. We took the bowl away after that point. Might be better to go with a silicon or softer option as this is hard plastic.,3
Dog would bend the side over and did not use it much.,3
"Our pug likes them, but will have to see if they work for the purpose of why were trying them out.",5
Both my dogs love it!,5
My dog enjoys these treats very much.  It is an item that I have been buying repeatedly in the future.,5
"My cats have gone completely crazy for these and have spent hours playing with them.  That's all anyone can ask, right?",5
"I wanted a smaller ball for my little dog...not a shorter handle for me! This thing is about 18 inches long and I still have to bend over almost to the ground to scoop up the ball. I want a small scoop on a regular length handle, or what's the point?",2
Terrible for aggressive chewers. Terrible for aggressive chewers. My pitbull had it in pieces within minutes. I returned it in pieces.,1
I'm not really sure what to put here other than my cat gobbles these up so I am giving it 5 stars based on his reaction. :),5
"I live in an apartment with four roommates, and I let my kittens run around the common areas all day.  But they like to come sleep in bed with me at night, meaning I had to keep my bedroom door open, which isn't conducive to a roommate setting.  This cat door was perfect.

Installing it was easy.  It comes with a template that you trace on your door for the hole.  It took just a few minutes with a jigsaw.  The door frame is actually two pieces that you pull apart and sandwich the door between.  You don't actually need the piece without the door hanging from it, but it covers up the edges of the hole.  Like other reviews say, it seems to be made for screens or really thin doors, because when using it on a standard interior door there's still a gap between the pieces.

The cats don't seem to mind the imperfections and neither do I.  I gave it four stars because when the cats step through it you can see the gap in between the frame, which looks sloppy.  Also, the magnet doesn't always catch.  Sometimes the door gets stuck a bit open, which is fine unless you want to lock the door one way.

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this to someone who wants a fast and affordable solution.  I plan to buy more of these in the future, too!",4
"I've used this coupler to take my two large lab-mix dogs on hikes. The bungees are great so that the dogs don't get excited and pull each other (or me) with a quick movement. It only took my dogs about three minutes to figure out how to walk together with the coupler.

Best for Greyhound and other breed use.... clean by tossing in the dishwasher...,5
Nice color,5
"Perfect fit for my lab mix. She's roughly 80 pounds and I ordered the XL. The material isn't too thick and it feels very soft. Definitely not itchy material. It was very easy to get on my dog who usually fights me when it comes time to put her harness on.

Easy to switch on and off. The on/off button is located inside the jacket. The lights are pretty bright and vibrant. This is perfect for trick or treating or just for out on a walk. I'm sure I will get many compliments on it! I did receive this product at a discount for my unbiased review.",5
just adorable fits great,5
Hard to clean and dispenses treats too easily.  Kept my puppy occupied for only a few minutes.,3
soft and seems good quality,5
LOVE,5
"These work great, but my dog is about 55-60 pounds so I thought they would fit perfect.  They are a little tight because she is wide.  They still fit, but the XXL fit better.  So just because the pounds are right doesn't mean they will fit.",4
Bought two for my 55 gallon tank. Fits perfect and easy to cut the back plastic for individual prefence on filter and other equipment. Also keeps my tank water from evaporating so fast. Very pleased with this product.,5
They last a very long time but are not a favorite like pigs ears. They stink when chewed. Dogs don't mind but I do.,3
Purchased this for camping as our camper space is at a premium. Holds 6 cups of our dog's food (we use Fromm's). He's a golden and that is 3 days worth. Nice sturdy container that will keep out the creepy crawlies.,5
Does not leak.,5
cheap and the water has to be changed every couple of days.,1
"Puppy won't stop playing with it!  She carries it everywhere.  Had about a dozen presents in a large box, hiding from prying eyes, and pup sorted through and dragged this out, ignoring everything else.  Tried hiding it and she went back and took the other one I was going to gift.  Had a bit of a chemical odor, but that is fading.  The squeaking can get a bit distracting, but knowing she's chewing on the toy instead of my hair clips makes it all good.",5
"I have two Malinois.  As they are supposed to be military working dogs, I ordered these dog tags for them instead of cutesy bone-shaped ones.  They really hold up well.  I've had to get extra silencers, as the rubber doesn't last that long.",5
"Works on my topless bio-cube 29, but just extra work and extra outlet plugs needed...",3
My dogs are 70 & 100 lbs...these are the best toys around for their size! Almost indestructible and lasts a very long time.,5
"Hoping this will work out. I have had dogs all my life. Wanted this for a long time. Put the dog on my table hooked him up, wasn't high enough. Easy fix, raised the arm, but could not get the thumb screw tight enough I guess. It slipped down & hit my puppy in the head. Had to stop for the day as he got scared. Tried again the next day & the same thing happened. May need to make a indent so it does not slip down. Or may just be because it is new, it is slippery. Will keep trying, because it would be a big help if I can get it working.",3
"My iguana is very finicky eating, but this helps really great",5
Seems to shed worse than my dog. Buy she's not eating it! I won't be machine washing this as I think it will ruin both the bed and my washer. Just use it until it's dead and get a new one,4
Best harness out there in the market!,5
"The thumb retracting latch wouldn't work. Small, cheaply made. Used for one dog walk, and each time I tried to un-latch it (pull back the pin with my thumb), it stuck and needed 2 hands to activate. Seemed like a decent leash, except for that. Could've spent another .50 cents on a bigger, more sturdy latch. AND it's only 10 ft. long! It didn't say that in the title...need to read the fine print blow the description. The many  others I've bought, and viewed this time, are 16 ft.",2
"We had to return this because it was just too small for our two year old Samoyed. The measurements 34 in x 24 in x 10 in, but you could barely see it under our dog. The ad states the size as large.  Maybe it is this big with the bolsters crushed down and bulging out. The bed does look very nicely made and our dog would have loved it if she would have fit. Lastly, the seller refunded $15.xx on a $48.xx purchase, calling it a restocking fee. Knowing all of this up front, we definitely would have purchased locally.",1
"Lexi looks amazing in her Hoodie! She gets cold very easily, so it keeps her fashionably warm. The sizes were just right. She has had the sweater for a while, and it has held together really well. I have people come up and ask where I got her hoodie and I direct them to Amaz-on! She also loves the attention she gets.  :)",5
I love the easy open classe.,5
My dog easily chomped off the knots and swallowed them whole.  Not very safe!,1
"Both of my bulldogs love these. They are pretty big, so I break them in half. And they smell really good too, with the rosemary & sage herbs that are mixed into them. Love that they are made in the USA (won't buy any treats that are made in China, too risky...)",5
Excellent!,5
smaller and cheaper fabric than I expected,3
Love that these covers are cheap to replace.  My dogs love these beds.,5
I owned two pair of dog toenail clippers and could not find either pair.  My dogs nails were getting so long I had to order another pair.  Although it sounds like bad luck it was actually one of my dogs luckiest days.  These nail clippers are well built but the major plus it that cut right through the nail without startling the dog and no nail tears.  It also has a protective part that keeps you from cutting the quick.  I was really amazed at how easily these cut the dogs nails with no resistance therefore no anxiety for the dog.  Clip nail is cut.  Simple as that.,5
"I have had lots of dogs and now have a new puppy, and have two dogs at the moment.  So, I have ordered these type of things before.  This is by far the best way to contain a small puppy.  It has room for his small bed, his water dish and food dish (food dish when I set it in there) and a pee pad (half of one) leaving a little bit of play area too boot.  As secure as this is, I am not going to be worried that he will get out nor another dog will get in with him if I leave the house.  This is far more worth the money than the others I have had.  The ones with the netting were trashed within minutes as the puppies just pulled and pulled at the screens.  I almost ordered another one of those and a roll of duct tape... but saw this at such a reasonable price.  Of course, free would have been better.  However, this is a better quality and will last a long while.  I did see where you can order two more sides and make it larger.. for almost the same price as a whole other one.  I'm thinking I'll just buy another one and either put them together or split up the two dogs where I am concerned about leaving them.  The little munchkin found his pee pad twice already and he's only been in there about 20 minutes!!  I am loving this pen.  Just ordered another one.  Those long stakes that hold it together are a bugger to get out... I couldn't do it (and I am strong)... my husband is even stronger and had a hard time pulling them out to assemble.  So, you will need some one very strong as they are very tight.",5
Sizing was dead on! Teacup yorkie nephew looked handsome in the navy xs,5
"Not a favorite here. So, I've gone back to homemade food.

Product has been around for several years and I've tried it with other dogs I've had. Just not a favorite for any of my dogs.

Some people have great success with this food so I can't fault it for not being liked here at my house.",3
Didn't last long before being destroyed. not very durable,3
Good enough for George good enough for me!! George wants to eat it every day!!,5
No need for this if your using it for newly welled puppies. Ordered it never needed it. The mat kept a perfect temp,5
I was excited to give the toy to my puppy because my puppy loves toys with audio but when I pressed the toy it has no sound at all except for the very weak screaching sound. It was a waste of money.,1
Unfortunately my cat was not interested.,2
My kitties love this food.  The kibble is nice and small for kittens and chicken is listed as the first ingredient.  The ingredients list overall looks pretty good so I feel good about feeding them this food.,5
Works great. Arrived on time.,5
"I place these next to my cats' two litter boxes.  While I am sort of obsessive about keeping clean litter boxes (I scoop them twice daily), it's hard to avoid at least some odor, and in a small house like mine that's a problem.

I've noticed that these sponges really do help eliminate any lingering odor, though I wish they were a little less expensive.  I intend to try others' suggestions about pulling the sponge out of the container to extend its effectiveness and use.  Still, this is good stuff and I would recommend it for other cat owners.",4
I love this bed and so does my little princess!,5
"I originally ordered a box of these because they contain no grains (not good for kitties) and the internet reviews were promising. All cats seem to love chicken -- it tastes just like chicken, dontcha know -- and the little carnivores just don't need sweet potatoes in their dinner. It is a lot more expensive than supermarket brands, but that's only because it's real food. Subscribing to it can save a little money. There is nothing in here that was swept up off a slaughterhouse floor. Three cats get two meals a piece out of one can, so that's pretty good. When they're all eating at once, it sounds like a slobberfest, and that's a very good thing.",5
"I was so happy to find these on Amazon.  I discovered these recently in a local pet spa and my dogs loved them.  I have 2 Border Collies, who love bully sticks, however, it gives one of them horrendous gas, I mean room clearing gas!  Thankfully the duck feet do not upset his stomach the same way. Once you get over the inital disgust and vision of poor ducks in wheelchairs - it's all happiness!",5
"Great Product, Highly Recommend",5
"I bought this moss for a humid-hide for my leopard gecko. He is not shy about chasing down crickets that try to hide in it!  It holds the humidity very well. It comes in clusters, and I have found it lasts longer if you don't break it up too much. You can easily tell when to change it by the change in the color. When the time comes for Mr. Lizard to shed, he enjoys to bury himself deep in the moss, and seems to have no trouble becoming tangled in it.",5
"This is the second time I order from this Amazon seller. I had a little snag with the shipping carrier but after receiving the package that was accidentally delivered to my neighbor, we got it on as soon as possible.

My pups love it! Product is very well stitched and too cute! Definitely recommend it!",5
Quality is good for the price. Fits well but runs a little small. You might want to buy one size larger.,5
"My dog enjoys chewing on these and they seem to be tough enough to keep her entertained (she is a beagle/blue heeler mix). But for me the pungent aroma of the chews makes them for outdoor use only. Which Is fine as it is summerbut this might not be the best winter treat. Of course the aroma is what makes my dog so enthusiastic about this treat so it's a tradeoff. Note that my wife and I are both sensitive to smells so others may not find this aspect bothersome.

On the plus side these are made in Germany, not China, and I appreciate treats made in countries with high health and safety standards.",4
The treats arrived all broken  into small  pieces.,1
cats seem to like this,4
"We have four dogs, and this is their favorite chew toy. They absolutely love it!",5
Our dog devours these in any flavor.,5
"These are a great grain free snack or treat for my dog. She loves them, can't get enough!!",5
"Very nice carrier. My cat, Sierra, who is 7 years old liked it much better than the hard plastic one I had for years. It's a little small, it's fine for the short trip to the vet because she is a petite cat. My larger cat will not like it, but our vet is less than 5 minutes away. For the 1x a year they usually go it will work out well.",4
Excellent brush!  Grooming goes much faster with much less pulling!  I wish I had gotten this brush a year ago instead of fighting with my cheap pet store brush!,5
My dogs love this food. It's one of the only ones I have found that none of my dogs are allergic to or have any issues with.,5
"This works really great!  I haven't had to use the shock button, just the vibrate and he is fine.  This gives him our whole yard to run and play with no worries.  Thank you so much!",5
"My dog wants nothing to do with the hard nylabones, but actually chews on this one! He's a 55lb coonhound and not a super strong chewer so this works very well for us.",5
Great food! Great brand. Cat loves and begs for more!,5
"I bought this dog carrier for my poodle/Chihuahua mix. I would NOT recommend this carrier and this is why:

The description says that the carrier holds up to 22 pounds:
This is false. My puppy weighs about 8 pounds and he just fit in the carrier. It was so tight that he hated being in there and didn't want to stay in the carrier.

No opening on the top of the carrier for the dog to stick his head out of:
There are two side pockets which are totally useless because as soon as I opened the side pockets my puppy ran over to stick his head out of the side pocket and actually jumped out of the carrier from one of the side pockets. It was a good thing we were in my home and not outside.

The carrier had a terrible smell in it like chemicals:
The smell was very strong and even though I put my puppies favorite treats in the carrier, he would not go in. When I forced him in the carrier he started whimpering to get out.

It seemed like a great carrier from the picture and description. I also read other reviews which lead me to believe it would be great, but I was not pleased with it. If your dog is around 22 pounds there is NO way your dog will fit. My puppy barely fit at 8 pounds. He hated the carrier and so did I. So my advise to you, is to buy another carrier.",1
This ball is easy to grab for our 9 month old GSD and light enough to throw or kick with ease. The grooves in the ball make this really easy for himt to grab as well as for small hands to throw. Our next purchase will be the football shaped ball!,4
It broke apart after 3 uses . I have a 86lb Doberman and we were walking the chains came apart and he got free and almost attacked another dog... complete trash!!!,1
"I love these.. have a cannister type filter and tend to change these out fairly often, put em on top of your media baskets and they help keep the particles out of your tank enabling your filter to keep your tank crystal clear.",5
"This is my current favorite litter. It does scatter, especially as it is lightweight, but it is easier to clean up than other litters, as the pieces are larger. It has no strong odor of its own but it controls litterbox odors well. It clumps really well, minimizing waste. I prefer it to World's Best Forest Scent, which doesn't clump reliably, and it is less expensive and easier to find than Weruva It's a Tea Potty litter, which is also lightweight, clumps well, but has a stronger scent. It's also very convenient to be able to order Okocat through Subscribe and Save.",5
"I have picky and sensitive cats and this is the only food they can all eat without digestive upset.  They love it and their coats are silky soft.  If you have issues about shipping damage, send it back and Amazon will replace it.  No need to lower the rating of the product due to shipping problems.",5
"I've been using my new BAG-it and PERMA-lid combo for several weeks now and it makes cleaning the litter a snap. It's really nice not to have to remove the litter receptacle to clean out the waste. If you don't like scooping cat poop every day, get a Littermaid, and if you get a Littermaid, you simply HAVE to get BAG-it (and PERMA-lid) because you never have to buy another receptacle. They can be your last Littermaid-related purchase ever. You can use free grocery bags with them and it keeps everything nice and clean. It really makes cat litter as hassle-free as humanly possible!
I'm so glad I got BAG-it and PERMA-lid. Brilliant. Seriously, they made my Littermaid purchase so much more worth it!",5
My cat loves this and I like having it delivered. The product comes in several different sizes and you are bound to find the size and flavor you and your cat want.,5

"Pain in the ass to put together but hey, what are you gonna do? It didn't take too long. Seems to be decent quality. The thing is pretty big. It's wide and tall. Stands sturdy however the two perches are quite wobbly. My cat won't go on it at all yet. Doing the treat and catnip thing so we're trying. Cat trees seem to be really expensive but this one seems like a good price for what you get. We will update on how the cat likes it and how it holds up.",4
Did the trick.,5
"This lasted about a week.  Its cute, and my conure liked climbing it.  The problem is that it is pretty flimsy.  If you try to stretch it too far, its going to break.  I had trouble cleaning it after a weeks use, and ended up throwing it away.",3
My dogs love them.  I do however cut off any parts that could be swallowed or cause them to choke.,5

"I have a 13 year old 80 lb. lab mix, who can no longer hold his bladder for the time period I am at work and I can't afford a dog walker to provide him extra walks. I have tried a couple of other pee pads and usually end up using 3-4 pads twice a day and yes still have to mop the bathroom floor each time. I purchased these pads and first day only needed one pad, caught it all with no mess on the floor.
As for the sizing the other pads both had 1 & 1/2 to 2 inch edges with no padding that was included in the size of the pad noted on the box. Top Dog however the pad is exactly the size indicated with no wasted edging.",5
"I purchased 2 bottles.  First bottle sprayed a few times and then broke.  2nd bottle, spray bottle is broken.
Smells good.  Can't be sure if it really works or not.  Will need to put in working spray bottles.  For the price, they
need to make sure to have their product in quality spray bottles.",3
The ears on the hat don't stand up and the rest of the costume isn't visible unless your dog is sitting up.  I liked the Robin costume better.,2
Our dog certainly enjoys his alligator biscuits. They hold together better than the soft chews although even when the soft chews crumble we add a little of the crumbles to his food as a treat sometimes.,5
"Dogs gone wild...holy cow, or should I say reindeer.  My s***zu loves this toy and it's crazy fun to watch him work those critters out of the holes.  I laugh every time he runs into the room with this in his mouth.",5
My Kai is VERY HAPPY with this product....Kai is a malti-poo and sometimes the rawhide braided chews are too heavy for him....these were the perfect weight and length for my little guy and he has spent hours with this chew since we received them the other day...And I LOVE the fact they are made in the USA!!!  I would highly recommend them!,5
My 3 month old border collie loves chewing on this even though he gets bored of it after 15 minutes. The trick is to hide it for a while and then give it back to him and he'll love chewing it again! We put it in the freezer absorbed with water and it takes about 20 minutes to be ready for the pup. He gets entertained with licking the ice off and he loves chewing on both of the ends. It's definitely well made because he hasn't been able to rip any of the cloth off unlike some of his other toys.,5
"I will admit, I was skeptical as I have purchased many products for my Blue Heeler/Husky mix.  I am convinced that this is a must have for any dog with a shedding problem.  When it arrived yesterday, I immediately put it to use.  I was shocked by how much of my dog's undercoat I was able to get out.  The best thing was that he loved it!  He is now losing his winter coat so I am thrilled to have this comb at this time of the year.  I highly recommend this comb!",5
Love these! Great for my dog's thick toenails!,5
"My dogs HATED this ball! But it worked as advertised, no accounting for a dog's taste. On the flip side, my toddler grandnephew LOVED it so I cleaned it off and let him take it home!",4
Our 4 cats love it.,5
"I ordered 3 of these collars in different color combinations for our 3 dogs. They arrived in a reasonable time frame, we're customized exactly as I requested and they look great!  The collars seem to be very sturdy and the free tags that came along are nice. I would definitely order these again!!",5
Our Maine Coon cat loves this.,5
"Beautiful calendar, arrived on time!  These calendars make the perfect gift for anyone on your Christmas list.  They are more than calendars, they are works of art!!",5
"My dog loves the giggly sounds.  She is bored with the squeaky toys, so this was a pleasant surprise for her. It's a little bigger than most dog toys, so it might be to big for a tiny dog.",5
Lasted about a year. Well worth the $5 paid.,4
"The tag I ordered was really cute, and cost half of what it would at the pet store. I'm really pleased, and plan to order more!",5
"We've had three different solutions for the cat litter tracking problem, and this one is BY FAR the best.

A throw carpet or rug doesn't work.

The pads they sell with the plastic-wiry surface that's supposed to trap litter do work... but not entirely, and worse, they're difficult to manage, as every day you need to clean the litter out from them in a drawn-out process. Even worse, if the cat pees on them, they absorb the odor and it's game over.

We've had this pad for two weeks and it is light years beyond the other solutions. It seems to trap more of the litter than the wiry pads, and I don't even know how. It's completely trivial to clean - the litter has nothing to stick to. And best of all, it's coated. We had a cat vomit on the thing, and the liquid literally stayed there for a day until we noticed (it seeped in, which is gross, but no odors lingered and no liquid remained after a simple paper towel).",5
"Great bowl, great quality, and looks good! Dog has done a number on previous bowls and items we've had, but this is still looking like the day we got it!

My only wish is I had gotten one size bigger.",5
This is the best litter box I have ever had! Easiest litter clean up ever!,5
Great product for my dog!,5
My Llasa Apso loves this treat and it is highly recommended for dogs with diabetes since it is freeze dried.  She was diagnosed with diabetes in Nov. 2013 and has not had any problem with this treat.,5
"Our 14 lb Chinweenie LOVES this food over dry kibble. She has a history of bladder stones so we have to be careful about the amount of minerals in her food. Fixing it is not a problem, just add water to the amount indicated on the chart based on her weight and let it sit a few minutes and you have a bowl that looks like porridge or mushy oatmeal. The price per feeding comes out cheaper or about the same price as other similar quality grain free dry kibble. The only thing I dislike is the amount of flakes versus dried pieces of chicken. The top part of the bag has the most chunks but as you get toward the middle I have to dig to find even a tiny piece of chicken. I wish they would add more dried chicken to the bags since I'm guessing most of the flakes are the potatoes and that doesn't sound very healthy (we supplement with other food so this isn't her main source of nutrition.) Unless some of the flakes are chicken flakes I don't see how chicken is the number on ingredient since there are so few visible pieces. We have not had problems with our girl with bladder stones since she's been on this though, so far.",4
Excellent product !  My Yorkie has a problem with her back knee and I bought these at the vet originally.  Noticed a difference in just a couple of days.  Almost $15 cheaper here on Amazon.,5
works but would prefer a snap closure,4
MY FUR BABY LOVES THEM,5
The limited ingredient food from natural balance has been very helpful with my lab's allergies.,5
"My puppy loves them! There are a lot in the bag, they're a nice size, and they definitely seem to be making her happy.",5
"I bought 3 packages (6 total mats) of the largest size (24"" x 36"").  They look nice.  They are substantial, thick, and lay flat.  They soak up dog pee really well. Even if the dog flips one over on itself and pees on the underside, the underside will soak up pee to some degree and prevent a puddle on the floor.  If you have enough of them, then you can just change them whenever it's necessary.  I had been using the standard puppy pee pads made of paper with a blue plastic backing, and my dog would relentlessly flip them around, pee on the blue plastic instead of the paper, and then chew them to shreds. The paper ones show a big yellow circle after the dog pees; the cloth ones just look wet, not yellow.  Much better optics.  What I also did was to get the 72"" / 6' square ""Whelping & Puppy Pad"" (tan on top, white on the bottom) to lay on the bottom of the playpen area (5' square), and then use the Puppy Pads on top of the Whelping Pad, so that even if he misses one of the Dog Mats, the whelping pad will catch it.  Seems to be working pretty well.  No urine smell like there was with the paper mats, no drip, no mess, no irritating paper shredding or jumping around destroying them.  My dog leaves these alone.  He may flip them around once in awhile, but doesn't chew them.  This is a great solution for those who have a washing machine handy.  I use regular laundry detergent and some Borax (no bleach or ammonia), and wash them on Gentle Cycle.  Borax kills germs pretty well.  They come out smelling nice.  I've only had them a couple of weeks, and I imagine they will eventually wear out, but I plan to buy more.  Here's the link to the large ""whelping pad"" that I put on the bottom of the play pen:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004F8Z4GS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Update, April 13, 2018:  Just to say, I've been using these for six months now, and I've ordered more, have ten pads total now.  I wish I had known about these earlier!  My dog is fully potty trained to ""hold it"" for #2 and ""go"" outside, but when I have to be away at work, he pees on the puppy pads, and I just change the pads.  I got ten in all so I would always have plenty ready to go.  The fabric and stitching are durable through many washings.  They are still like new, no signs of wear after months of use.  My dog shows no interest in chewing on them or tearing them up like the paper ones.  This is an excellent product!  -->  Two tips:  Wash them on Gentle cycle, and hang them to dry (don't dry them in the dryer), and they won't wear out.  I use Borax with detergent to disinfect them.  And bonus - they seem to absorb any odor on the dog himself after he's sat or laid on them, and they make my pup smell clean as a whistle.",5
"I swear by this stuff.  We had to gave it to our family dog, who had her one of her front legs amputated from a hit-and-run accident, and it really helped her other front leg support her and allow her to run and play in her later years.  We more recently have given it to the family cat, and what an amazing difference it has made in him!  He was in so much pain just a few months ago that we thought we would have to put him down.  After starting him on Cosequin, he is much more mobile and social.  We can clearly see that despite being 19 years old, his quality of life has much improved since starting this medication.  I would recommend for anyone who has a pet with arthritis or joint/tendon inflammation issues to talk to their vet about treating with Cosequin.",5
Good,4
love it but the just or whatever it is around the poles is coming apart  the cats have a blast on it and sleep on it too.  I have eight cats! It was difficult to put together.  Find a guy to help you or a girl who has that type of talent.,4
My dogs love them.  A little expensive though.,4
Arrived with no security wrap sealing package.,3
"I am very please with this litter box cover.  It fits over my Breeze litter box with room to spare.  It was a little awkward to put together, but the instructions were very detailed and easy to understand.  My only complaint is that in the product description it is listed as ""wicker"" but it is really made of plastic.  However, it is still a very attractive litter box cover.",4
Got 2 of these to put on my 55 African tank and these 2 work perfect had em not even 2 weeks already had to change the pads.  They work great!!!  Way better than the other more expensive filters,5
"I just bought two of the 5 cup bowels from Dr.s Foster & Smith and they are great! They are of solid build, excellent rubber traction and dishwasher safe (although it's easier to quickly wash rather than take up valuable real estate in the dishwasher). We just picked up two 9 week old Newfoundlands (large breed) last week and can see how they have to navigate around the whole bunt cake style bowl, which should keep wolfing their food down to a minimum, as best as can be expected. This is quite important to us as one of our last beloved Newfies died from bloating a year and a half ago (the other who had been his shadow was never the same afterwards and died of kidney and other complications several months later). We had looked at some of the other bowls that had the large nubs protruding up from the bottom, and while the design looked good for dogs with slim snouts, I feel a big faced Newfie would have a frustrating time of it getting in there.  I highly recommend this product, even just as a good solid feeding bowl! Jody Koval",5
"I have a picky little Jack Russell Terrorist who would rather go hungry than eat something not to her discriminating standards. (Go figure....she loves rabbit droppings.) Anyway, we bought the first can of this to feed to another of our dogs, who has digestive issues. He loved this, but it didn't help with his problem, so I'm still cooking food for him.

Never one to give up, I tried this on our Jack and she loves it. So, I ordered a case, finding the price on Amazon to be less than half of that at my local retailer.",5
Keeps my pup warm and it holds up to frequent washing quite nice,5
"I REALLY LIKE THIS BOTTLE, IT'S EASY FOR MY DOXIE

"I have cats and a couple of friends with cat allergies. Using this product on my cats along with another product on the furniture (an allergen reducer from the Nature's Miracle product line) has made a huge difference. My allergic friends are far more comfortable around the cats after using this product, and I would highly recommend it.",4
My 2 cats play with this everyday. It is a worthwhile addition to their choices of toys..,5
"Don't let the picture fool you.  I thought I was getting a great deal judging by the picture (looks to me like there are four bowls), however, you must read slowly and carefully...it's only one bowl.  I would have never spent this much money for one small bowl.  In all fairness, the bowl is very nice but I feel like the picture should match the description. Amazon is my favorite but they struck out on this one.",2
I have a one year old Yorkie about 5 pounds.  Tough potty training her.  Love this product.  Runs true to size.,5
"I like that my dog can get extra benefit from these.  I just have a hard time getting him to eat them, and he isn't a picky eater.",4
Pup is excited with fuzzy balls with squeakers--these ones fit the bill and are cheap.  Easy to replace once the fuzz starts fraying.,5
"Kitty loves these, just don't give them to the cats and kitties everyday or they will get the runs..",5
"My cat loves these. I thought she would reject them, she's picky. But now she is vomiting less often, so they must be helping her with hairballs.",4
"I've had it for one week, and today I noticed some sparking through the holes at the top of the dome where the bulb screws in. I unscrewed the bulb and one spot is clearly burnt. After re-screwing it in, the sparking didn't stop...im feeling like it's too much of a fire hazard to leave plugged in and would love for the seller to re-send me one. If so, my rating will gladly change.",1
perfect,5
"I cannot believe how awesome this product really is. My 17 year old cat, who i've never seen really play before, absolutely loves this toy. It is also fun for me as well. My boyfriend who didn't believe it would really make a difference with his cats is surprised by how much they actually like it. We bought it for the cats but my ferrets actually like it as well. Its really funny watching all of them.",5
So cute!,5
They like paying with these but once my ferrets decide to stash them under the couch they easily puncture and chew up the product. They need to be tougher soo they last longer.,3
works like a charm.,4
great when we go for walks the dogs love it,5
This is so cute. Smaller than expected but it will do,4
Works great!!,5
"Used to be better, but after the latest purchase of the company it's just too much money for what it is. It's the price of higher quality, better blend foods but is mostly sweet potato.
I do like the fact that the ingredients are all considered safe, with one or two that are argued about. It's still good, just not as good as it was, and paying so much for sweet potato when there are so many other options  just doesn't make sense.",3
"I got these on the recommendation of my vet but should have realized that they aren't the best for an allergy dog.  So, I had to quit giving them to my dog after a couple of days since she developed ""issues"".  Other than that I'm sure that they are helpful for the teeth and I wish we could keep using them.",4
"He lasted a week, didn't have AFLAC so RIP Ducky!",5
"I like these just fine. Unfortunately, my cats don't seem to care for them. I have one cat that will play with just about anything and he gave these a swat or two and moved on.

These are pretty much what they appear to be. Thin plastic springs. My Maine Coon will carry these around in his mouth and bat at them a bit, so I'm going to put a couple in the treat bag and see if that makes him more interested.

I don't have any issues with these, but my cats just don't care about them. For now. Next week they may be the best toy ever invented! But if not, that's ok too. For the price, it was worth a try. I can give them away if they don't take an interest in them. Sadly, that's the way it is with cats. You can't always predict the outcome.",3
"I have a 6 lb poodle thought this would be perfect but I think only a 1 lb dog would fit ( small console.  I returned it Great idea wish it would have worked. I ended up buying the full doggie car seat it works perfect

"I started using this product for my very sick dog two years ago.  She was diagnosed with an auto immune disease and put on a regimen of Prednisone and other meds.  Two years later, she is still alive.  One Denamarin every day.  Much cheaper than buying it from the vet.",5
Cat LOVED this toy!!!,5
"Definitely NOT for aggressive chewers, otherwise, a very cool & well- made toy :)",4
"These were very disappointing compared to the 'super thick' rolls.  I love knowing this brand has taken good care of the product so it is safe and that it has the whole hide with the healthy glucosamune, thus the three stars,  but if you have a heavy chewer at all you're better off ordering the super thick.  My dog just started chewing about 10 minutes ago and he's already eaten about 1/4 of the roll.  With the super thick he would barely have gotten a few small pieces off and the roll would last for hours.",3
"Let me start by saying that I ordered two of these.  One seems to work perfectly with no issues.

The second one had a loose wheel, if that makes sense.  The wheel that you turn to adjust the temp is very, very loose.  So loose that you can barely bump the controller, or move it around, and it changes temp.  I am going to have to get it replaced under warranty, or tape it so that it doesn't move.  I didn't test it until too late to return it to Amazon, or I would have done that.  The functionality seems to work great, but the temperature adjustment wheel could use some work.",3
"I got the purple flower for my dog and it has definitely slowed down his eating. It's not really that laborious for him to try and get to the food, maybe the last few pieces, but he always licks his bowl clean. They say the small size is good for 2 cups, but that would fill it up to the brim... 1 - 1.5 cups is a good amount (I feed my dog about 1 cup per meal)...

Construction is quite solid, and it's not a big deal to hand wash and set on the counter to dry.",5
"My senior kitty loves this food.  Good price, quick delivery.",5
"Heidi had the knot apart in less then an hour, very disappointed, I just tied the strings to the rope and now she can wear it",1
Dogs love it.,5
Purchased this through pet meds and about a half hour later after putting only 3 drops in each ear my cats eyes started watering really bad and all she wanted to do is lay.she started breathing really heavy also. I'm monitoring her and keeping a close eye. So far my other cat hasn't encountered the same issue. Just hope my cat is ok. This stuff is very potent I will say. Very strong. Do not use the recommended dose.it's by far way too much. Limit it to 3 drops not 10 which is what the bottle recommends. Hope this helps the next person. Would not give any stars at all.,2
Absolutely love this xxs is perfect for a tea cup,5
"The only thing that helps my dog's ears. He probably has allergies but my vet told me it's super expensive and hard to pinpoint. His ears get irritated all the time and nothing worked. I need to use it more regularly, but this stuff is awesome. The price seems to have gone up a bit, but it's cheaper than antibiotics. I loved this stuff so much that I also bought the shampoo and conditioner. My dog used to run away when I did his ears, but now I think he realizes it helps and puts up with me.",5
This would get a higher rating except for the channels in the bottom of the box. It is more difficult to scoop urine clumps of litter.,3
"looks really nice on my puppy french bulldog, she received a lot of compliments. nice quality for the price!",5
"This product was recommended to us by one of our vet's technicians who said it works great for her dogs. We have been using it for about 2 months, but find results mixed. We still have to get out into the yard to pick up right after the dogs have been out, and we don't know how well it works because we try not to give them the chance to prove whether it does or doesn't. We are not giving up on it, though, and will reorder as the supply gets low. It appears to be a good product, so will give it some more time.
Right now the rating is 3-star because the technician said it's great, and it might be, but we haven't proven it in our case with certainty. All dogs are different.
Update: I stopped using it, though I still have half a bottle. It didn't seem to be that effective over time and I personally don't like to use a product like this on a forever basis, though I'm told that it is quite safe to do so.",3
It works. I inherited to elderly dogs when my parent went into a nursing home. I noticed an improved cognitive function in them after feeding it to them for 2wks. Dog seem to like the flavor. Although it give them really smelling farts at bed time. If they lowered the price more people would probably buy it.,3
"Great litterbox, easy to pop the top on and off for easy daily cleaning, the scoop works great with pine pellet litter. I put this litter box inside Ikea shelft Besta that we ""hacked"" to hide the litter box in, and it fits in it perfectly.",5
The puppy loves this toy... this is her favorite toy.. will be buying her more of these... great for tugging and playing.,5
dog loves them,5
I first became aware of this brand from my old vet.  He used it to clean my dog's ears at the time and I noticed the pleasant smell.  I figured it must be a good brand if my vet was using it.  It works great as do other brands but I like the fresh smell after cleaning my dog's ears.,5
"Worth the money, for shearing Angora rabbits. Brush the blade clean frequently for best results, when shearing fine, dense Angira rabbit wool.",5
Great buy.,5
"Virtually indestructible, and replaced under warranty if your companion manages to gnaw an end off...
They bounce, they're flexible and floatable, and provide excellent pliable resistance for those with obsessive chewing instincts - WITHOUT posing any risk of damage to teeth!",5
Harness is WAY too big!! I measured my dog like 4 times. Their chart is so far off that it isn't even funny. They emailed me about my issue and told me to keep the harness and pass it on to a friend or rescue and are sending me a small today! Great company! The product is really well made too. the best one that I've ever gotten!,5
"Best slow feeder dog bowls for us. I have 4 dogs, 3 Brussels Griffons and 1 Shiba Inu. The Shiba liked to chew their old bowls that were great slow feeders but made of plastic. And I mean he REALLY chewed the crud out of them. Not only were they unsightly but had sharp torn out places on them so I purchased these. Haha...try chewing that, Shiba!!!",5
smaller than expected,3
"Exactly as pictured, my problem finding best site to place. Had another similar item about 20 years ago. Hope this is as good.",3

Dogs love it.,5
"You need really strong thumbs to work this brush. In order to have the brush bristles out you have to push down the button the whole time. This makes it very hard to hold the dog, brush and hold the button all at the same time. Giving it 2 stares because my dog did seem to enjoy the way it felt. But just way to hard to use.",2
My cats love the Party mix and let me know when it is time for a treat.,5
"I never liked nylabones before I got them for my dogs. They always seemed dirty, hair sticks to the ends after they've been chewed and dogs will make their gums bleed chewing them. But my dogs make quick work of any chewy (they finish even very large edible chewies in less than one minute), so we got the durable nylabones and the dogs love to chew them. They are not indestructable but they last for months even with daily use. The dogs do make their gums bleed chewing them at first but I was surprised to see how clean their teeth are now. A good thing to have for a serious chewer.",4
Does the job well on my 35lb pup,5
"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because they run small. The first one I bought was at a store so I was able to try it on her. I have an 8lb min pin that should be in the extra small. She wears a small. They go on easy, which is a big plus, they are cool in the heat and they wash well.",4
Works great!  Growing plants like crazy in my fish tank. Runs 8 hours a day,5
"The first picture of this item makes it seem thick and plush but the other pictures are more accurate. They toy is actually pretty flat but was a lot longer than I was expecting. My lab loves stuffed toys that squeak and this one instantly became her favorite because of all the squeakers in it. I don't recommend this for dogs that destroy toys because I think it wouldn't last an hour for them but since my dog doesn't tear them up, I think we'll get a lot of use out of this one.",4
Love this leash. The clasp works well. Minus one star because I wish there were two loops at the bottom of the leash. My 5'10'' husband can't use the hand loop without bending over.,4
"I bought this brand and style more than twenty years ago.  When I got ready to buy more, they were only available here.  Great construction, easy assembly and strong for heavier cats.",5
Perfect thermometer for my aquarium.  Keeps the temp of the water accurately.  Easy to read.,5
Works well.,5
Not at all satisfactory (after getting the 'Chicken' Zuke's Hip Action from Chewy.  Old and leathery.  Still have some of these as ShadowRae likes just about anything else as a treat EXCEPT these (Beef).,1
"People who want to feed their dogs all natural, USA-made treats need not look any further.  My five dogs really like all the treats by this company and this one is no different.  The strips are all irregularly shaped but do break easily into smaller pieces for smaller dogs.  One can see and smell the chicken in these.

These don't make my dogs sick in any way.",5
my dog loved to eat it but it did not seem to fill him like the adult light which i use now,3
"The only kittymalt that I buy is Excel. I give this to my 5 cats twice weekly and have never seen any of them coughing or hacking up hairballs. oh, BTW, they can't wait to lick it off my finger !!",5
"Durable rope and a great price. WE have a 20 pound puggle who loves to chew on this rope. They are really expensive at the pet store, so I decided to try this one. No complaints. It has been working well for a few months. No problems like the other reviewers. Feel confident buying this rope toy.",5
"Super-reflective leash!  The only reason I give it 4 vs 5 stars is because it is a bit heavy.  I have been searching for a reflective leash for night-time walking with my cats.  I love the reflectivity of the leash when struck by flashlight or floodlights.  However, it is just way too heavy for my purpose.  I know it is not marketed as a cat leash and I do not fault the product.  Even for a small dog, I think this would be too heavy.  On the flip side, it is quite sturdy.",4
my second of these ( use one for outdoor fur baby),5
Very good quality product.  My 5 mos. old kitty loves this!  Lots of different combos in the kit.  Better quality than expected - last wand ordered from another site didn't hold up as long and had less items to place on the wand.  Very happy with this purchase!,5
"Great little brush, easy on the kittens delicate skin ! Small enough to reach all the hard to reach areas. Easy to clean. I highly recommend this brush. I have 2 Siberian kittens that have a very dense under coat, especially now with the winter coat filling in and this brush gets a work out believe me !!",5
These are a healthy treat for our dog. I break them into smaller pieces and keep them in a covered jar.,5
Seems to work well,4
"i just love having this to train my pup on,love that he cannot drag the pad around after he handles his buisness on it,think of how unsanitary that is esp. if you have kids!",5
I like this because it keeps my one-year-old cat occupied for a little bit.  It is sturdy and easy to clean.,5
Cats love the good stretch they get from the height of the pole.  Would have given it 5 stars if it had rubber feet on bottom of platform so it wouldn't slide on wood floors when they play on it. And if the top of pole had sufficient coverage with sisal rope.  It started to gap as soon as they clawed at the top of the pole.  Seems like that should have the best rope coverage for our tall cats.  Delivered with top of pole stuck out of box unprotected.,3
good product,4
"This is a great toy for dogs, my dog will run around the backyard playing with this toy all by herself.",5
"Works great.  My dogs love it, just try to keep it away from the bigger dogs.  Perfect for my Miniature bull terrier.",4
"I love this leash! I have a 120 lb. rottie/shepard mix. Hes a big, strong boy and he likes to explore while on our walks, so the length is really great. I feel very secure using this heavy duty leash. I have just ordered a new one, as the one i have is about 2 years old and the spring inside which rolls the tape back up has kind of loosened up and the first foot or so of tape dosent retract anymore. But i cannot complain at all after using this for almost 2 years, almost daily. So its a great product, and i hear they are going to discontinue them. I hope not. This is the best leash ive ever owned!!!!",5
I have two dogs and they love these treats!,5
"UPDATE: Approximately 1 month into cold and snowy weather, 9+ months after I purchased this item it broke. My 65lb dog was found several houses down; he had snapped this chain in half. He probably chewed it some, and maybe started to rust in spots where rain got in, but it still shows this is a weak chain. I would not trust it with a large breed dog, I got extremely lucky and noticed my dog was gone probably minutes after it happened, otherwise my dog may be permanently missing or dead. Considering it only lasted 9 months and my trust in it could've killed my dog : 2 stars is pretty generous.

I will say just make sure you check the whole length of your chain regularly and any small cuts or holes will soon rust and give a dog 1/4 the weight limit of the chain the ability to break it... For the money it should've lasted longer under normal usage, there's nothing I could've done differently to prolong it's life. Additionally almost the entire clasp/clip part of it rusted within 1 month of snow, and made it much more difficult to open up in sub freezing temperatures.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
My dog is only 65-75lbs but he's broken two chains already. I think both of those chains got rusty and weakened after a winter/snowy season. He loves to get a full running start as he chases something he see's and pull on this with of his weight and speed. Hopefully this one holds out this winter, I'll update otherwise. It's about twice as thick as the others and the outer coating over the chain seems more flexible, thicker, and less brittle then the other two I've had (once the cover breaks open it lets the elements in and starts rusting the chain). I definitely recommend this chain if you have problems with your large dog breaking the tie out chains.",2
Pretty durable crate for a great price. Has a double lock.,5
This product is great and healthy for your dogs. We have 2 King Charles and they love them. Yams are so healthy...for them.,5
"I really wanted to love this cat toy but it has some faults.  First off the movement is okay on hard tile floors but even on low pile carpet it will not move at all.  Movement seems a bit slow for my cat too, maybe the batteries aren't great?  It seems to turn off after a more than light hit and I have to go and turn it on again manually.  Doesn't get stuck under most things, just watch out for the oven and fridge gaps.  Cat does seem to enjoy it and it keeps her occupied for a little while.",4
"These are not as absorbent as I had hoped.

Sizing: I ordered small, but they were too small for my Chaweenie.",3

"I searched quite a bit looking for a good quality stainless steel food bowl for my dogs.  Bought several, but was disappointed how thin the metal was, and the lack of capacity.  Advertised 32oz in other brands really is very small.  I put 2 cups of food into some of them and it feels almost too much to hold.  This Best of Breed bowl is much heavier stainless, seems much better made, a nice sturdy non-slip base.  Time will tell if it holds up, but I like the rather small profile vs. other brands where the base is very wide but capacity is small.  I really like this bowl, will buy another!",5

No stuffing FTW,5
"I bought some of these for Suzy who loves balls. She does not like these.

The balls are small, perhaps better for a kitten than an adult cat.

The catnip is merely sprinkled in the bag with them, not inside the puff balls.

The bag I got had drab colored puff balls: mostly white with a little black or brown or dark purple. Suzy is into loud bright colors.",3
"I'm a new puppy mom and have researched everything to death. Bones=bad, bully sticks=bad, Nylabones=bad. So what can I give this wild little creature to keep him occupied and to stop chewing on my socks, pillows, toilet paper, etc?! He gets bored with toys easily and he eats his Get Naked dental sticks in about 30 seconds. This is the first product that I haven't heard an awful emergency vet visit story (yet), and so far they've lived up to the hype for me and my puppy. They do smell strongly like fish because...they're literal pieces of fish. I mean, what do you expect?! It's not the most pleasant smell but at this point I wouldn't care if they smelled like horse manure mixed with onions and sulfur seriously- I would give anything to this dog that is both safe and keeps him busy so I can do my own thing for a few minutes. He loves them so much I had to hide the box because he would sit under the counter, stare at it and cry until I gave him one. Currently he has been working on the same piece for about 30 minutes, enough time for me to shower and write this review and not worry about him destroying something else in the house. Hallelujah!

EDIT: I also cut smaller pieces and stick them inside a Kong-- keeps puppy busy for even longer!",5
Bought for our two small mice in a 10 gallon cage.  Gives them something to play on without taking up a lot of room.,5

"My cat has and loves two West Paw Design toys for cats (Crawly Critter and Hair Ball), but cats usually tend to be much better at testing out beds than toys! West Paw Design markets the bumper bed up to size medium for cats as well as for dogs. Though they consider this size to be for multiple cats, my cat is big (15 pounds) and likes to sprawl out when sleeping, so the medium size is almost too small for him, and wouldn't comfortably hold him and another cat.

The bumper bed is a really creative and convenient design. The interior/center is a pillow that comes out. Around that is an elongated-donut-shaped ""bumper,"" and under the bumper is fabric that the pillow sits on, tucked under the edges (inside) of the bumper. Both the bumper section and center pillow have removable covers, though if your dog or cat gets the bed really messy, you can wash the entire bed, not just the covers! And with a lot of other pet beds being foam, this is a great feature that many of them don't offer.

My cat, who usually loves anything that looks soft and comfy, was petrified of this bed, and though I tried to get him used to it beginning September 19th through various means (covering it with his own smelly blanket, taking out the center pillow, etc.), he continued to resist it until January of the following year (2012--this review has been updated). First, he was offended by the ""new product"" smell (which eventually wore off). But the main source of the fear is that the bed fiber-fill is extremely plump, yet ""gives"" a lot when it's stepped on. It's not as firm as ""cup"" beds, or the furniture that they tend to steal--like chairs, couches, and blankets. The loft could probably be compared to two fluffy new bed pillows stacked together. It's even twice as thick as his other pillow-style bed. This airy-plump, shifting surface creates an unstable feeling that panics him. At first, the only way I could get him to sleep in it was to put him in it when he was half asleep--but he wouldn't stick around for long. Putting a firm pet blanket in it eventually helped him accept it.

For pets who love soft, comfy beds, this is a great pick. But if your pet is used to firmer surfaces like ""people beds,"" foam pet beds, and couches, this bed may feel too soft and shifty to him or her.

Again, as for size, you may wish to order up. I think the size depends less on your pet's weight and type and more on your pet's preferred sleeping position. Pets that curl up may like to have a smaller bed that surrounds them, but my cat is a 15-pound sprawler, and fills up the whole medium size, and then some, spilling over onto the bumper. I uploaded a photo of him in the photos section to show a size comparison.

Persistence pays off! He now loves this bed, and ""allowed"" me to bump up the rating from four to five stars.",5
"This item is NOT engraved into the metal. It's only ""engraved"" into the paint. The paint started wearing off a few months into purchase and is no longer legible...
Find another brand...",1
This is a soft and comfy fleece vest perfect for my Yorkie. Hes 10 months old and 8lbs and this fits great. I love the back clip for our walks because he doesnt wear a neck collar. Even though it fits it was a bit tight getting his legs through.,5
"Great filter for the money. Pretty easy to setup, never set up a canister before and didn't have any trouble. Was a little noisy at first but after a couple weeks the impeller got some natural slime built up and now it's almost silent.",5
pets love it,5
I believe I got too big of a muzzle. Doesn't fit well,3
"Great product!  My cats just love these treats, even my picky cat.  Nice packaging and received very quickly in the mail.",5
Really love the solidness of this and the multiple branches. They hop all over it and sharpen their beaks on it.,5
"This was rated one of the best dog foods on an independent study of over 1,300 foods so I tried it. My dogs LOVE it. It is not near as smelly as other dog foods, my dogs had no digestive issues switching from their previous food, and I know I'm providing the best nutrition out there. All ingredients are sourced in the U.S. and their factory has never been involved in a recall. What's not to love? It has my thumbs up. ",5
She is starting to like it.,3
Excellent but pricey.,5
This Nylabone Go Active oddball is really nifty.  I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier.  I bought this for his 3rd birthday as an indoor/outdoor ball.  It definitely keeps him entertained and he tries to figure out where the ball will bounce too.  It's fun and he is really enjoying this oddball.  The Oddball itself is very bouncy and decent size and weight and quite sturdy.  He's had this for 2 weeks now and it seems to be holding up quite well and seems about indestructable.  It says it can also float but i've yet to test it out in the swimming pool.,5

It's challenging enough, and what I like the most is the ability to adjust the opening which makes it easier or harder as they get used to it.  It's also non destructible and easy to clean. I would buy again for any of my pets. Highly Recommended.",5
Water gets in when you wash between outside and liner.,1
I don't know what is wrong with my cats......  They love the scratcher in the middle.  They act like they have never seen a ball before tho.  They play with it a little.  Maybe they will figure it out one of these days.,5
A good toy for a dog that destroys toys quickly! At least it takes awhile.,5
"Ordered originally on a recommendation of a local pet store. My dog has an allergy which we have not been able to identify the trigger. Many allergies are food related. Pet store personnel recommended changing my dog to a raw food diet. Took about a month or so but Bella stopped chewing on her feet.

We had friends over who brought their mini chihuahua over who is extremely picky. She LOVED the Ziwi Peak dog food. Gobbled it up.",5
My Cairn Terrier has been eating Royal Canin food since he was a puppy.  Now that he's 8 it was time to introduce Mini Mature into his regular diet.,5
Good product and reasonably priced. I will buy again.,4
my dogs loves these,5
Worked...See nothing in stool,5
Best qality dog food on the market! Also offered at a very reasonable price.  Our family wouldn't choose any other dog food for our girls.,5
I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!,5
"This is probably my fifth purchase from this company.  I've tried other brands but I'm done shopping around. Pawstruck, you're the one! What I get in the bag always seems fair. If I happen to get a skinny stick, there's some jumbos in there to make up for it. The sticks have s bit of a smell when the bag is first opened but the smell goes away super fast, like leave the bag open for an hour (or less) and it is gone. I store these right in the kitchen on a small table off to the side where we keep keys, etc., and they don't smell everything up at all. I currently have a Chesapeake Bay Retriever puppy and she is a big dog at a young age and she loves to chew.  A lot. Oh, how she loves to chew! These sticks last, keep her happy, and don't upset the belly. The only thing I would say is, I do not give her one of these in her kennel when we are leaving the house because they always make her thirsty. So these 7"" and 5"" bully sticks are the every day sticks we use and then I also get the larger braided or curly sticks to keep her occupied longer when we have company. And if you are worried about the cost, stop worrying. If you have a chewer, stop wasting your money on toys they will destroy in no time and just get these! And not to mention the junk they will ingest from the toys as they tear them apart.",5
Use this in my beta tank to feed a mystery snail and african dwarf frog. Easy to feed and doesn't pollute the water.,5
Lathers well and rinses well. Makes the dogs smell nice too.,5
It was too small.,3
"I don't know if it was the toy or the puppy teeth but our Pyrnees mix pup sure had a lot of fun destroying this toy.  I was impressed  at first as it is well made and was well reviewed by a large dog rescue group. BUT when Riley saw it she loved it and promptly chewed the trim off and tore up the body. I won't blame the construction as she tears up Fire Hose toys just as quickly. At least she had a lot of fun and although badly mauled the toy is still in her toy pile.
I do think this toy is well constructed and pretty sturdy.
Photo is just a few days work.",4
"These are the greatest toys for dogs who love to run, jump and catch!  Our German Shepherd can't get enough of this toy.  She did chew the first one a little while she was a younger pup, but now at 8 months old, she has a total of four flying squirrels.  I wash these in the washing machine on gently cycle and they come out perfectly clean and without any damage.  Our 9-year old dog is now wanting in on the action!  Plus, these are way cheaper at Amazon than at PetSmart.",5
"This cat food was well received by our cat.  He enjoyed the taste and had no particular issues with digesting it.  Our cat is also a rescue who was starving when we met him, so he tends not to be picky about what food is offered.  Your cat may be different.  In any event, I would have no qualms about purchasing this food for our kitty.",5
You get what you pay for. The item is fine but feels / looks kinda cheap,2
"Thought it was going to work great - I have a Austrailian Sheppard/Border Collie mix... Medium size dog, about 40 lbs, lasted 4 hours before it was chewed into little pieces on the floor.",2
Best kit I have purchased!,5
Great harness.  We have been using this brand for three years.  Spots clean up easy in the sink with hand soap. Love the pink!,5
Too big for my little dog but he still cuddles with it.,5
dog does not like it.  tried on 3 different breeds.,2
was ok,3
"I bought this because we have 3 stray cats who live on our property and we like to keep them fed, especially in the winter when hunting is a little bit more difficult for them. They are not very picky eaters, but they really liked this cat food. I also buy the Rachael Ray nutrish dog food for my dogs on occasion because I like that it doesn't contain bunch of fillers and gross ingredients.",5
"one whole roll was defective, not together..had to throw the entire roll away.",3
"If your dog has teeth, which I assume he does, this toy could be dangerous to him!

My dog had this for all of three minutes and I had to take it away because he already had gotten chunks of it off. If he'd swallowed them this would have become a VERY expensive toy! He would have loved playing with this, but I'm not taking the chance.

Waste of money.",1
These are the best. However my dogs are 25 pounds and the small is too small then thr medium is too big,5
"Just as described, this toy speaks for itself! It doesn't need batteries, my dogsloveit the pups play with it together using there paws moving it back and forth! Thought the noise would be unbearable but it's so not that, I love this toy I would most definitely recommend!",5
Horrible fell off. No bootie really works,1
My cat has problems with constipation. With the help of the Vet and after several years of trying other solutions we came to this combination: My cats gets 1/2 packet of FortiFlora and 1.5ml Lactulose daily. We have been on this solution for about 4 years now. And the best of all is my cat likes the FortiFlora and will come to me when it is time for her medicine.,5
We bought this crate for our brand new 10 week old black lab mix puppy!!  So far she loves it and this thing is very sturdy so that she'd have a very hard time breaking out of it.  Both doors have multiple locking mechanisms to combat curious puppies. We put her pillow right in there and she's in and out of the crate all day and sleeps fine at night in it.  The separator piece works great to minimize the space she has to run around in while put away in the crate at night.  She'll be growing out of the separator wall soon as she's going to get around 50lbs or so.,5
These things move a LOT of water and my 75 gallon mbuna tank is because of it.,4
"Initial review (see Edit):  My cat loves this toy.  I ordered 3 knowing that there wasn't a choice.  I'd hoped to get at least 1 flamingo (the orangy pink one) because I know that one's his favorite out of all of them.  What did I get?  3 of the same ""bug"".  Luckily he's right now losing his kitty mind on the one I was able to finally completely get off the packaging.  Be aware, very small clear plastic bits hold the toy on the cardboard.  They're really hard to get ahold of to be cut off and they need to be.  They are the same type of plastic that are used on hangtags.  But small.  And potentially could cut up a cat's mouth or face or eyes.  So feel around to be sure you get them removed, please.  Otherwise, it's a really cool toy, the elastic ""string"" isn't too long or too short.  I'm sitting on the handle part and my cat is playing with this on his own.  Yes he loves it.  He would have loved the flamingo even more.  Please if people order multiples, give us a selection of the toys, not all the same one.  Thanks.

Edit:  These aren't expensive, but if you have a very playful or rough play cat do not get these.  My kitty had the first one destroyed, stuffing falling out all over the place destroyed, in under 2 hours.  That makes it not a good buy even inexpensively and potential hazard if the cat decides to start eating the stuffing.  Between that and the plastic bits on the packaging?  Disappointed in you, Kong.  Will not buy again, would not recommend",2
"This is an affordable cat scratcher, which doubles as a resting place for your cat. My cat loves it. We started using different styles of cardboard cat scratchers when she was just a kitten and believe me, it has totally saved my furniture. All I had to do was tell her 'No"" when she went after the furniture a couple of times and then we heaped a lot of praise on her when she used the cardboard scratcher, and she has been an angel about staying away from my couch and other furniture.

This hammock would be the perfect tool for teaching a young kitten what items are safe to scratch, and I am sure would work with an older cat, as well. (Contrary to popular opinion, cats are very smart, and both praise and treats go a long way towards teaching them good behavior.) These types of scratchers are the perfect, humane alternative to de-clawing your cat. This particular style comes in two pieces which slide together to form the hammock. It was simple to set up. I am happy that Petstages and Amazon are making these cardboard cat scratchers available at such a great price. Five stars from me, and five stars from my perfect cat.",5
My cats as a bunch love the entire Party Mix line; I was surprised at their total pleasure with this dessert crunchy as opposed to other dessert offerings from Friskie's.,5
"Product ripped to pieces in 1 day.  Would only suggest if you dogs do not chew everything.  Other than that, it is a good product.",2
works great on one dog; the other one completely ignores the signal. At least half the barking stops when the button is pushed.,4
"This is IT!!!! A MUST for kitties to do what comes natural. 32"" high, four sided sisal. And the cost was over $30 less than buying the same item/model in brick & mortor stores.",5
"I have two handicapped kittens, both six months old. One is a domestic short hair that lost her leg and shoulder to a traumatic injury, and the other is a scottish fold with severe osteochondrodysplasia that I rescued. Because of their disabilities, they need a food that will insure theygrow strong with the proper nutrients and taurine that they need. I will ALWAYS feed wellness CORE wet kitten food until they're a year old then switch to the adult formula. I have looked at other brands like Taste of The Wild and others, but they just don' compare in the kitten department. They love the taste, and it is palatable enough to mix in in their vitamins.",5
Great deal and my birds like it.,5
"This is the best seat cover I've ever bought (and I don't use the word ""best"" lightly""). I've only had this seat cover for a couple weeks, but I've gotten a lot of use out of it (my dog goes everywhere with me) and I can already tell its different than the rest. I own a Jeep Grand Cherokee with leather seating and have a 60+ lb pitbull. Every other seat cover I've owned slips all over the leather seats and comes off, but this one hasn't moved an inch. Its anchored in place by two handles you slide between the seats, and there is a rubber backing that prevents it from sliding all over the place. My dog doesn't exactly sit still while in the car. When she first gets in, (not while I'm driving), she runs back and forth across the bench seat and rolls all around to rub her back. Despite all her craziness, this cover has stayed put! I am thoroughly impressed! At first, I was a little hesitant on spending so much money for a seat cover, because the most I'd ever spent was around $30, but all of the covers I used were junk and didn't last so I decided to try a more expensive one in hopes of getting a different outcome, and I got one. This product is worth every penny! Trust me, this seat cover will not disappoint. And the company offers an awesome satisfaction guarantee in that if you have ANY issues, they will remedy the situation. Give it a shot! You have nothing to lose!",5
"Doesn't make sense to go from the filter that came with it to this as a replacement.

"My dog has mild arthritis and she was prescribed Rimadyl.  It was difficult to give her this pill and she hardily resisted.  Since I've been using the pill pockets, she thinks she's getting a treat instead of medication.  I would give them five stars, except when you get near the bottom of the package, they are really quite greasy.  Nothing I can't live with, though; I'm pleased with this product.",4
The cats hated it,1
Works great. No fleas or tics bothering my dogs now. Lasts almost 8 months.,5
"It lasted about 2 days at most. We have a Pit Bull mix that loves to chew his toys. Once he gets through a little piece, he starts eating the material, so for that reason we decided to get rid of the toy. To be fair though, the disclaimer said that no actual toy is actually indestructible. It lasted a little longer than some regular chew toys.",3
Vibrant color! I bought the purple one and it's very pretty and long also. More thin than I thought it would be but it seems sturdy. Perfect for smaller dog breeds.,5
"When I got my little dog, my daughter gave me one of these. Of course we wore it out and I spent months trying to replace it. I FINALLY found these online, and they work the best for me. I tuck the little bags in there. Easy and worth the money.",5
I have always used Frontline. It's always worked well for my pets. The shipment was fast and the price reasonable.,4
My cat loves this food so much we have to make sure the closet is closed or she has tried to open the bag on her own to eat more! Love the velcor  closure on the bag. We have ordered more. Great product for a great price and free shipping on our prime membership. Thanks,5
My lop loves this he plays with it for hours,5
"This brush is good quality and as described. My Maltese is a little bit too fragile for the metal teeth, but I fluff his coat with the black bristles occasionally. I would recommend this brush for a bigger dog.",3
Third Waggle we've gotten for our two big dogs. They fling this thing all over the house to get their treats out! Great way to keep them occupied.,5
"I purchased this item because I'm frequently rushing out the door at the last minute in the morning, and buying this eliminated one more thing to do in the morning! I found that this product was very easy to program and took less than 5 minutes. I've had it since September and still haven't had to replace the batteries. As many reviewers have mentioned, I have had some issues with the food getting stuck in the dispensing chute (some comes out but not all). I'm not sure if this is a shape or size issue. However, the food always seems to eventually trickle out. My cat loves it and runs to it when he hears it dispense at its automated time!",4
Very pleased my bully loves it and the XL size fit her perfectly,5
"Second one that does not work, so both going to he returned.  Thanks a lot leaving us without heated tubs in sub zero weather.  Had problems with this brand 2 years ago. Done. Never again.  Does not heat at all. The first one leaked. Worst design ever.  Cheap design for big $$$.",1
"I first bought this in a local store, and my piggy seemed to really like it.  Can't find it locally any longer, so I ordered a bag.  Still smells FANTASTIC, but the bag I got doesn't seem very fresh.  That said, my guinea pig still seems to like it...and I do appreciate the lovely fragrance.",4
I have a Cockapoo and he has very curly hair like a lamb.  It costs about $50 to get a professional grooming. I have a grooming kit but it didn't really work that well.  This one works REALLY well.  Make sure to use a clipper or your dog will look like a Picasso art work...,5
This is is perfect. Very easy to assemble and my kitten loves it. Got this item 1 day after ordering. I have never had such great service from buying on line.,5
IS OKAY.,4
"The cosmos has seen fit to bring an extra rough and tumble cattle dog into our lives, he LOVES this toy. I LOVE this toy too, lol! It's just bouncy enough to rebound off walls and cabinets. It does make some noise, but not enough to bother this sound sensitive human. It's quite quiet on hard floors, it tumbles along, making gentle popping noises as the kibble tumbles around. It sounds like a child's popper toy a few yards away.",5
"Great waterproof jacket, reversible, detachable hood and snaps closed under belly.  Size large fits my 8 lb dog.",5
Our three dogs LOVE this ice cream.  It's perfect treat on hot days.,5
Good product,4
"This is my favorite harness for my 8 month old cavalier king charles Spaniel Bentley. It is easy to get on him, and I like where the d ring is located. higher than other harnesses but not too high. I feel it is good quality material, and it is soft so it probably is comfier for Bentley than his regular basic harness, and his step in harness. Bentley is 13.5 lbs (or was about a month ago) and the medium fit him perfectly with room to make it bigger when he grows. If it is cold I can put it over a sweater, if it is warm he can just wear it with out, a it is easy to adjust.",5
"Very good quality but even though I ordered the extra small, it still was too big for my dog.",4
"My dogs are in the den with vinyl flooring.  It gets so cold and so I bought this warmer.  Dogs have large padded beds but still I want to keep them warm.  This product would be perfect for someone with warmer climates like California or Hawaii.  For Alaskans I would get  a K&H or Milliard bed warmer more sturdy and rugged for colder weather.  My dogs are snow dogs and love to play outside for abou 1/2 hour before coming inside again.  Even if I had a Maltese or Yorkie, this pad would not be sufficient.  Hence a great product is this for warm weather in their cold months.

I did like the design and the size of the unit.  The high, low, off switch is not distinguishable so you have to tinker with it a bit.  There are directions from the sellers that explains the different settings of the pad.",3
Cats grew bored.,2
These treats are perfect for training. They are the right size and 3 calories each. My pup LOVES them.,5
"High quality stainless steel. Our little pug had 8 puppies. These little dogs are sometimes very eager when it comes to their food. One dog will try to eat up all the food. This is why I had to get this bowl. It's perfect, putting the food in so all of them will be able to eat at the same time.",4
"Love this shampoo, make my dog feel like he has silk fur!",5
"Great for my dog's breakfast. She eats one a day in the morning and then gets a big dinner at night. We don't rehydrate them, she likes them as-is.",5
So cute but very small..,5
Funtime for kitty's bedtime.  Every cat gets 1.,5
Blue loves her ball,5
Inconvenient for removing to clean or fill.,2
My cats do not like this flavor in wet food. They don't mind the dry. The wet food sticks to your spoon or fork and seems  dry and smells worse than other seafood brands. Unfortunately bought a case so I'll have to rotate it in every 3rd day.,2
Love plant. Ordered one and then ordered another i liked it so well.  Perfect foreground plant or works well in smaller tanks.  My betta love it and hide under it or between leaves.  No worries about it hurting their fins.  Very cute and natural looking. Definitely would consider buying more if need additional small plants.,5
This brush is great it works so well I have a Morkie puppy and it works very well on his hair and the fact that the Combs go back in and the only thing you have to do is remove the hair on top of the brush easy cleanup,5
"""Break-Away"" is the only true pressure break away collar, and the ONLY collars I feel at ease about leaving on my dogs, mine & fosters, throughout the entire day.  I feel safe knowing they can't get hung up on something and choke themselves, and I feel safe knowing that if they ever happen to slip out the door or yard without me (especially my fosters) that they will still have their tags on for a simple, easy return to me(cause none of the general public have chip scanners, lol). And because of the double D-rings, I can still hold them or leash them by the collar without any issues.",5
All my cats love Medleys!!!,5
I keep my cat's litter box in this cage and keep the cat in when needed.  It is big enough where she is comfortable and often chooses to go in there to nap on the ledges. It's her safe spot away from the dogs and a good place for me to confine her when I'm trying to cook and she won't leave me alone!,5
"I liked it, however, I was really too big for a 20 gallon tank, my filter is one of those big rock formations.",4
Not accurate. Of no use to me.,2
"Nice self cleaning, litter box. Does what it says it does. It rotates every 15 minutes to ensure that the box stays clean and limits the odor. Sometimes, a piece of litter will get between the actual pan and base itself and make a scratching noise, that can be very irritating until you figure out what it is. But, once that piece is removed, the item goes back to being quiet. It was shipped very quickly and still works as promised. I like the fact that you do not have to purchase special bags to put in the refuse receptacle. You can just use the plastic grocery bags like you would get from Walmart. Just tie them up and dump them in the garbage. Good buy, overall.",4
"First off, I can't believe I fell for this. I should have done more research. Secondly, a 3 pack is selling at Petco for $47!!!! Speechless. These products are terrible. DO NOT TRY. I do not even know where to start. The smell when I took them out of the package was terribly strong. I thought- wow. Well, I suppose I'll ignore and it will be worth it if it works, right? I put on my cat and had the thought of it being a non-breakaway... Again, ignoring. I'm at home most of the time and they don't go outside. Well, it's 24 hours and I have taken both of them off of my cats. They are in the trash, where they belong. It made my cats and I physically ill. My cats became extremely lethargic and stopped eating for 2 days. Last time I checked- ""calm"" shouldn't mean half dead. Even though I washed my hands immediately after applying, I had intense headaches and vertigo (which I have never had in my life) the entire time these things were in our home, on our cats. I can't even imagine how my cat felt with these chemicals on her neck. I want to figure out what they put on these things. I can't believe they are on the market.

Terrible experience, horrible product. Please, please do not buy for your kitties. There are much better and SAFER options out there!!!! This product has some awful reviews- some cats get chemical burns on their neck, others almost hang themselves. These are NOT SAFE. Please do your research!!",1
"As advertised, received promptly. Very satisfied.",5
Nice fountain..pretty quiet,5
It was for inside and I wanted one for outside. Sent back. May have been nice for inside. Didn't open when I seen it was for inside,4
The little 'un loves it!,5
the perfect slip lead for my lady dog who hates a harness.  Ships fast and as described!,5
"Seems it's not 3 little toys, the 3 in the title and the photo showing 3 toys is a way to trick you.  The shipping charge to send it back is almost as much as the toy so I'm stuck with it.",2
"Fun toy, however, not suitable for powerful chewers.  My pup had it ripped into pieces within 20 minutes.",4
"This is a very heavy duty, well made leash. It's wider than I though and a bit too much for my dog because she's very well trained but it will last forever. Being new, it is very stiff & will take time to break in.",5
"very nice ,I love the soft lights ,and my fishes do to.",5
"When I first received this item I thought it was going to be too heavy for me to carry, I know my name says James but that's my husband, I'm not super small but I'm tiny and have weak wrists so I was a little concerned.  After using the leash on a few walks my idea of the weight completely changed and I found it much more easy to manage my German Shepherd, he is 98 lbs.  My dog has a good long reach so when we walk in the woods he can romp and roam without being off leash.  I had a leash similar to this that I bought at the pet store, unsure which one, which was only rated for 10 lbs lighter and still well in his weight limit and it was flimsy and much shorter of a reach, quite honestly after getting this I felt a little gipped by my prior provider.  The lead is thick and doesn't feel like it's going to snap if he does get excited and happens to jerk me, fraying lead was the reason I had to replace my other one so I was very impressed that the lead was much thicker then the pet store versions.  The product is definitely hefty enough to be dropped or jerked by heavier animals and I was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed it so much.

Does not dispense small BB sized pellets in consistent quantity.,3
Believe it or not it was cheaper to buy this on line then at the store and it is delivered to your front door.  My dog loves this food and locally they don't always have his fav.,4
Good food for kittens but contains corn which I don't like in animal foods.,5
Excellent product!,5
Love the mini dog bike. Wide enough to fit  my 12 lb. Yorkie and my 3 lb. Yorkie in the carriage with plenty of room for both of them to turn around or lay down. The instructions was not clear on how to assemble but was able to do it on my own.,5
"As described.excellent quality. shipped timely. packed well,",5
"Ive set up 3 tanks with this so far.  The first one I did ammonia dosing and honestly couldn't tell you if it was any better or not.  The other two I used 1 fish and one reef hermit.  The tanks I cycled with the fish were both small 7 gal and 12 gallon, with Carib Sea life rock.  Never had any detectable ammonia or nitrite in either tank and had nitrates starting day 2 in one tank and day 3 the other.  I will note my ammonia dosed tank had much more algae and was much more work the first few months but had a much bigger population of bacteria and was able to take a lot more bioload once it was ready.( 40g breeder). I personally would never use ammonia again.  The fish cycle would need a much slower stocking rate and I would add bio Spira with each addition.  I feel comfortable recommending this to people as my results have been good but as with anything YMMV.",5
Thank god I'm able to order this off amazon ! No one in town keeps this particular type of hay with treats in it ! Our show bunnies love it and go to town on it when we place it out for them !,5
she asks for her treats daily on a regular basis.  she seems to enjoy these.  I've tried other natural balance flavors before. A good product.,4
I have been buying these for years. The dog loves them and they are very low in fat & calories.,5
"Sadly, it didn't work.  Tried it twice daily for two weeks on my Maltese/Havanese mix",2
Our Flemish Giant rabbit loved this toy! It was gone within a couple days.,5
Lasted about a minute. Not for big puppies.,1
it said this had a defect but i sure cant find it!! perfect!! and great price!!,5
"I recd a free sample due to a person contacting me offering it to me (for my two dogs) as a valued Amazon reviewer
My dogs enjoyed them so much I bought another bag for Christmas for them and continue to purchase them periodically from month to month",5
"My dogs LOVE these bully sticks. They have no odor and last long both an others I have used. A bit pricy, but well worth it. Seller sometimes even sends a thank you email with a discount code for my next order.",5
I really like the filter that these go to. I only wish the filters didn't get plugged so fast.,4
My puppy absolutely loves this food.  He is a rescue and I wanted to give him something really healthy and to be honest all the dog food recalls in the past kind of scared me so I did my research and am pretty satisfied as is my dog.  It is on the bit pricer side of dog food but I think it's worth the excitement my dog gets over eating it!,5
great deal,5
"Absolutely love this particular dog cover. Keeps dog hair off the seats and it will help when we go to the beach,  mountains or desert.  Easily removeable and washable.  I have an SUV and can turn it around to the back if the has to stay back there.  Thank you Bondvast and Amazon.",5
Good leather and great for training and walking the dog.,5
Very valuable toy package! My kitten loves them:))),5
I have a very furry Border Collie type of dog. She gets a massive bushy undercoat. Like white kinky fluffy mess of fur. On her hind legs and above her tail it's the worst. It just puffs out all over. I could never figure out how to tame this. I have the other flat razor brush that only works on short hair. This brush/comb gets it all ! There is definitely a knack to it if you don't want to hurt your dog but it's common sense. Don't dig it in close to their body and pull when there are big clumps. This only works once clumps are out. Otherwise it's like short choppy strokes. Im sure there is a video somewhere. She hates being groomed. And I always wondered how the groomer got her coat flat. Once she realized how much better it felt she actually stood there for the bad clumps under her legs. I can't say enough good things about this comb. Sad it took me 14.5 years to get one!! The last photo is before but it doesn't clearly show the giant fluff of hair. Not even close. The other two are after and I can easily still brush her for another hour. Fur is wet cause I just sprayed natural flea spray. First photo is a litter box filled with hair.,5
I purchased these for my Pomeranian - Chihuahua mix pups and the clippers worked great; I found them comparable to my $200+ professional clippers that broke.  The only thing I'd be cautious about is not trimming two dogs back to back; the clipper blade itself got warm from running so long on long-haired breed.,5
"Love it, but be aware this particular color attracts dirt like a vacuum for some reason. Got it in blue and purple and those must hide the dirt better.",4
"My pup loves this toy already, its a great material and seems super durable",5
Absolutely LOVE Chuck it and Kong toys! They're the ONLY toys I buy for my destructive doggies because they actually last without falling apart after one play session!,5
"great value, quick ship",5
:),5
Works well to take out the sting of pulling hair,5
"Looks nothing like the photo.  The sides are so soft that they lay almosat flat and do not support my dogs head at all. Donated it to
a local animal shelter.",1
"I don't think our puppy will be able to chew through this very easily!  He likes rolling it and pushing it around too.  It rolls, but is easier for him to control than a tennis ball.",4
High quality and the amount of squeakers compared to lesser quality products is insane.....your pet will love!!!!!!,5
It was clear my dog really liked these but they did not last nearly as long as the ones I usually buy. My dog will normally gnaw on one for over a month.. these last one sitting.,2
Love this hygrometer works really well I really love the min and max function lets me know how high and low the humidity gets up and down to,5
It fits my dog so perfectly!! She looks amazing in it. I forgot to take pictures sadly but it's a really cute bikini I didn't think I would get one for my doc.,5
My yorkie luvs this toy best outta all his choices....(and so do the other doggies ;),5
Very deceitful it's only about 5 inches big  not worth the money,3
"I use Nature's Micacle Advanced for dog urine. My dog used to urinate when overexcited and left trails of urine in the hall and puddles by the door. Since neutering this behaviour stopped, so I can see the Nature's Miracle Advanced working. The directions say to absorb as much of the urine as possible before applying, I use paper towels to soak it up until they come away spotty instead of soaking. I use the spray bottle to cover the stain with the product and leave the product on the stain instead of scrubbing it off. I haven't had any problems with the stains coming back, or being spotty. When using a blacklight, I've found sometimes I need to reapply to the puddles as it is mostly faded but not gone.",5
Great dog kibble for small dogs  only kind my toy dog will eat !,5
My cats love this toy.  The only down side is they chew the tail off almost immediately if I do not watch them.,5
"This is an absolutely darling sweater.  However it is too small for a deep chested dog, like a Doberman. I am going to give it so someone we know with a smaller dog. Really really cute sweater, well made and no static cling.",5
You need to buy extra crystal litter with this if you don't have any.  I bought it for my 3 month old kitten because I never want to scoop poo again.  There is a 4 year old dog in my house.  The kitty went straight in the box and has had no problems.  The box has cleaned every piece of gross kitten poo without fail.  It does stink slightly after he goes but its no worse than when my girlfriend leaves the bathroom.  The counter is up to 27 and I haven't had to change the box yet.  This product made my life slightly better for a couple minutes of work,5
"Out of all the brushes I bought, my cat likes these the best. Self cleaning mechanism works well but hair accumulates behind the plate that pushes the hair off the bristles. Also some of the rounded plastic ends fall off. Other than that its great.",5
blueberry pet coats are wonderful .if any are loose at neck i use needlepoint floss to gather up. amazon shows the weight of sweaters if you scroll way down and you can then decide which is warmer but ones with front leg are better when its real cold.i buy both types for this changing weather  of march in pa.these are better sweaters than i find in stores.,5
I could not use it on the dog I got and could not return it so I have given it away.,3
"If you haven't tried a top entry litter box, you don't know what your missing!
Clever Cat is the BEST of the ones I've tried, because the bottom is FLAT, no humps or bumps so scooping the box is easy.
No matter how energetic your cat is, litter will not scatter all over the floor.
All my friends switched immediately once they visited and saw how cool a tool this is for managing kitty toilets.",5
"I purchased 2 of these for my dogs. They absolutely love them. I have a pretty large black lab and this is perfect for her. Good job. UPDATE** While the dogs love them, both covers already need to be replaced, after around 5 months. The replacement covers aren't too expensive but I wish the material was a bit heavier. One bed has a couple of big holes and they are both sagging quite a bit.",5
great product,5
My cat loves this tower. Was very easy to put together. Highly recommended.,5
"Got this for a friend's dog. She LOVES it! Carries it around with her everywhere. The only problem I noticed is that she can pull the strings off and swallow them leading to either poo problems or tummy problems, but you generally run that risk with any rope toys.",5
Thank you,5
Good stuff,4
Great,5
"Easy to set up, looks great, has rolling capanilities on hard surfaces!",5
Longest lasting toy thus far.,5
Good product arrived quickly. Good expiration dates on the boxes. Thanks!,4
"We use it for our leopard gecko, but we do not use the outside portion.  The aquarium we use is not well suited for magnetic aspect, the inside portion can not set flat and rest completely against the side of the tank, so rather than risk having an accident and hurting the gecko we only use the inside section.",4
"Our second one, great reflectivity, but first one got so dirty (we have a big pond) we simply replaced it. Looks great and works great. Nice collar and lightweight but strong.",5
Almost killed my fish by overdosing them. If you follow the Seachem directions this API test kit will show that you need to add more drops. You will be sorry if you do !!! This product may work well with other Copper treatments but not Seachem Cupramine !!!,1
Always a favorite.,5
Looks great on her.,5
My dog loves it and it has lasted longer than most plush toys I have purchased for my very aggressive chewer.,5
Good product,5
"We've had several litter genies since the first release of this product- I even gift them to friends when they adopt a cat, or just when I hear them grumble about the scent of their litter box. Anyhow- this is about the refills- Buy them here on Amazon because you'll be hard pressed to find prices this low out in a brick and mortar store. I've never had any issue with ordering my refills online and HIGHLY suggest going for a 6 pack bundle to REALLY cut down on the cost. You're going to use them anyway!",5
After finding Earth bath products I will not use anything else our family is loyal to the product because they have been loyal to our pets and kept them clean and it's free,5
"These are a favorite with my coonhound. They are a stinky, healthy, and (apparently) yummy treat! Honest Kitchen is a great company with wonderful products for our pets. I am jealous of some of the reviewers who say their dogs use these for chew sticks. My dog eats these very very quickly.
Update to my review: These are still a hit with my coonhound. But after 3 boxes I have finally figured out there is a ziplock seal on the inner bag. Since the ziploc end of the bag is on the bottom of the cardboard box when you zip open the box top, I didn't notice till now. So, take the plastic bag out of the box, turn it over and you can seal the ""aroma"" in a little bit better!",5
"My 15lb chihuahua mix is obsessed with these toys. I bought him another one after he didn't destroy the first one and so far both are still intact. He normally rips toys in half in no time, but not these just yet.",5
Great quality food at a great price.,5
"Well-made food storage locker. Opens and closes easily. Replacement gaskets are available if the gasket seal wears out. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill and easy to scoop out the food.

Please note that this item comes with a scoop. I didn't realize it and I purchased a scoop to go with it which I don't need.",5
Great product - it works well.  Far better than the restraint my grooming table came with.,5
my dog who is really choosy on pills and vitamins really love this brand and i tried alot...he eats them without hesitation.,5
"Being an herbalist I was looking for a natural alternative to flea problems, after just ONE use of this intense clove oxides product, my poor babys eyes won't open!!
 Im furious and devastated and pray my dog isn't blind from this horrendous product.  Taking her to the Vet ASAP!  ABSOLUTE WORST PRODUCT EVER :,(

Oh, side note:  I think the fleas liked it and was not deterred by it.",1
My dogs love wearing these in the winter.  Very warm,5
"Love the look, the pup likes it, but seems a little thin on the base.",4
Raspberry smells so good!!,5
Arrived on time. My dogs love these.,5
"My two holland lops love this toy.  They ignored the peanuts inside, but love to throw the ball around and chewed it to shreds in about a week.  I wish these things came in six packs or something because I can't justify spending several dollars a week just on one toy.",5
Nice bed......dogs love.  Will not stay put on wood flooring. (When dogs run and jump in)  Best for carpeted floors.,4
"Ok so I got this device for my sisters 1 y/o male lab that had absolutely no understanding of the words heel, come, stay, yea no concept.  So before jumping right in with the collar I did some long lead training since he seemed to do ok on a regular lead.  After a short while he started to respond better until I think I finally broke him and he responded appropriately everytime.  Once we had the recall going it was time to take the lead off (yes this was a very compressed timeframe out of neccessity) and put on the collar.  Before using the collar I of course read the instructional literature provided.  The instructions covered everything I needed to know about using the collar, in other words they were all inclusive contrary to some other users experiences.  So after reading the instructions and putting the collar on the dog, I gave him the command to heel which we had previously worked and when he didn't respond I used the vibration feature.  I could tell by his reaction that this sensation was unwelcomed and likely unpleasant, however, this was not a shock, you can vibrate or use various levels of shock, however the two cannot be used together.  At the end of a single session the dog with a mind of his own was obeying commands and displaying the desired behavior.  My sister was very happy with the results and can now confidently let him out into the yard without worrying about him chasing critters in the night through the pasture for hours on end.  Bottom line, the collar works as advertised, no issues so far.  The collar unit appears to be solid, the remote/handheld seems a little on the fragile side but still usable and fits comfortably in your hand.
If you are looking for a robust, durable, expandable, run your dog through the woods and water regularly type of unit you should probably look at the higher end units which I accustomed to using.  You get what you pay for and in this case my sister was skeptical about the dogs response to the collar so we went with this less expensive unit.  For under $50 bucks you get a lot of bang for your buck.",4
This worked out great for our tiny kitten that hadn't been able to satisfy his need to chew on everything.  Great toy!,5
"Very durable, easy to travel with dog bowl. I love that the size is just right for our Golden Retriever. She has two, one for food and one for water. My husband has traveled with this while hiking, as it hooks on just about anything, and collapses. Make sure you order two, as this is just for one.",5
My dog loves this ball.anyways in his mouth,5
This thing is awesome!  Great to keep cats away from our bedroom door where they scratch to get in.  Funny to put on counter and scare your friends too.. Lol,5
"This a perfect bowl for our pooch, and it fits our feeder station too. Excellent way to get your doggy who gulps his/her meals to slow down. Eating too fast can provoke Bloat.",5
dogs loved it,5
"This works great for my cat. Fends off fleas. I used to use Frontline, but this has stopped working in recent years. This has been the first thing I was able to use and have work well.",5
"My dog loves this stroller. She has a heart problem, and she can't walk like she used to.",5
Fine dogfood.  I mix it with Eukanuba small bread puppy dry food.  Make sure you get 24 delivered.  I've been shorted several times.,5
"A well-made solid product. Easy to install. And our Chihuahua prefers to drink from this bowl rather than his other water dish. I feel better about leaving ""Jack"" in his kennel when I know he has a non-spill water dish. I would buy another for his kibble but he likes to tip his food dish over and hide the little nuggets among his blankets for later snacking.",5

Right now I have 6 cubes assembled, 4 cubes are arranged like an ""L"", with 2 on top so my two cats can lie on top and look look out of the window.

The absolute coolest thing about these modular boxes is: I can lift them easily and turn 90 degrees. Why would I do that? Whenever I do, my cats, who have owned these cubes for six months, stare at the new position, and check it out as it is a totally new thing. Of course, I can't simply turn my 6' cat tower because it is too heavy. These modular boxes are what their name describes - modular elements, anybody can rearranged in minutes. Which is why I would recommend them specifically to older people, who may not want to lift anything heavy.

I have owned these boxes for months. They are sturdy and both cats (one 3-yr old and one 4-yr old) love them.

Additional idea: Stuff a few sheets of Amazon's packaging paper (or any other stiff(er) paper that makes a crinkling sound) through the holes and you'll keep your cat(s) entertained for hours. They'll try to pull out the paper, bite into it etc...) - pls see pic.

5 stars, I'll always have modular boxes at my house.

"I have 3 cats that come in and out of the house.  I was skeptical at first, but they do a great job.  You may get a flea on your cat, but it won't stay.  Yes, the collar is pricey, but lasts many months.  It is worth it.",5
My dog loves this toy so much that I also bought the animal sounds babble ball.,5
"I don't use plastic clip collars on my dogs because I've had too many break. I chose this collar for the metal buckle and color, which contrasts nicely against my dog's black and brindle coat.
He's been wearing it for almost a year. Earlier this week, he escaped my yard and made it to the road. He was hit by a motorcycle and Thorn several dozen feet down the street along the asphalt. (Miraculously, both the rider and the dog will be okay.) The collar has gouges in the D-ring and buckle and minimal friction rubs/fuzzing on the nylon. If he had made it further away, his ID would've still been on him for someone to contact me.
I will be replacing his road rash collar with an identical collar. It did its job and I trust another one to do the job again, but I don't need the reminder every time I clip his leash on. (We've also put heavy duty springs on all exterior doors so he can't bolt out of them again.)",5
"So far it's working out great! I can't trust my 1 y.o. 65 lb. great dane mix off leash yet, but this leash is long enough that we can train, but not so long that it gets itself knotted. It's definitely a cotton-feel, not that silky-kind of leash, but he has pulled really hard on it and it's holding up just fine. Hopefully soon I'll be able to trust him, but as of now, this is working out great!",5
Great house except the floor falls apart pretty easy after some use... if they fixed that one thing then it would be great.,4
"This collar is wonderful for all breeds, regardless of training or temperament. It prevents back outs,slippage, and makes sure you always have control of the dog in any situation. Highly recommended for any breed and any size.",5
Totally functional & the perfect size! Roll easily! Sturdy! I love this!,5
"My Cats love this  toy, actually so does the dog!!!  They all  run after it together. It is much nicer then previous wands that I have purchased. I really like the fact that it retracts to make it easier for storage.  I found that the cats like the feathers  as, they look like birds. But they didn't like the fish one at all. Don't know why, but that's what happened. They just refused to play with it . The bell didn't add much, as you couldn't even  hear it.
When I put the wand high up on a book  shelf, they actually climbed up there to get it.  Great toy and well worth the money.
It's a great toy and well worth the price!!!!",5
"Could not stop our Yorkie from barking out the window at everything that walked or drove by. Followed the directions and sprayed once and said quite and she stopped barking and looked at me and I gave her a training treat and she went back to window and didn't bark at the dog or person. She is like a new dog and it only took 3 days and we leave the can sit there on end table so she can see it and my husband had her outside and just said quite when someone walked by and she stopped and didn't get a treat. It worked great, we are really happy with the results",5
Have 2 cats they love bout anything that hangs..pj pant strings towel stings ect..they could care less about this. The wire is too stiff to swing and 'dangle'. It just wacks back into their face when they tried to play with it.,1
"Ive made two orders of this product and my cats are obsessed.  Smell and they have fun, eat and they have peaceful sleep.  They love it so much and typically don't even take to catnip.  They both eat a tiny bit at night and curl up in our room and fall fast to sleep.  We also put it on their scratch posts and beds and we have seen a HUGE decline in them scratching any furniture, which was our main intention to begin.",5
My dog has a heart condition and I was looking for a product that was low in salt.  Wellness was the lowest one.  Rosie loves the treats and the wet /dry food.  It was no problem converting her to another brand.,5
"I purchased this litter box mainly to keep litter inside the box.  With the top being covered the cats can not spill it outside of the box.  This litter box also holds odor more inside the box especially with the carbon filter on the top.

I liked it so much that I purchased a 2nd Booda Litter Clean Step and can not wait
to get the 2nd one setup for my 3 indoor cats.",4
"This product is excellent! I have 2 female cats, a 3 & 10 yr old. The younger one will antagonize my older cat. Within minutes a calming effect for both cats after spraying in the air. I have tried other calming products, this is the best!! Thank you for diffusing aggressive behavior scenarios for our girls!",5
My dog is 15 yrs. old and he can not get along with out Cosequin tablets.  Very beneficial to his quality of life. Very thankful Amazon carries these.,5
Only product that's ever worked for skunk smell removal!! 100% recommend!! Use asap once your animal has been sprayed thought... timing is everything.,5
My red eared slider has been eating this food for years. He eats right away and has never had any trouble.,5
Dogs like them.,4
Absolutely fantastic.  My 8 year old Rough Collie loves them.  She has been a working dog for years but is retired now and her joints hurt her sometimes.  These steps allow her to get on the bed easily and without stressing her joints further.  I wish I had gotten it years ago.,5
Love these wipes.  I have a cat that is very sensitive to fragrance - and these wipes don't bother her a bit.  I highly recommend!,5

works fine,5
"Definitely durable, holds up to strong jaws.",4
Highly recommend.,5
Use with a harness so in case of an emergency my dog's neck won't break. It keeps him from jumping all over my car and fit perfect in my Toyota Camry.,5
"Very attractive, easy to clean. Just a little bit warmer than blanket but the cats seem to like it. Neat appearance.",4
"This is the best thing since sliced bread.  I love this dish, and have one for two dogs.  They take the time to taste their food, now, and I am sure it's better on their digestion.  As soon as more become available I am going to get more and give them as gifts for my friends who have dogs.",5
"My fishes like this, but they cannot eat it.",5
"It seems like an ok design, but does not fit a 2013 Subaru impreza wagon. It is too tall at the minimum height. Returning.",3
My bingo Cat fax like he can't even tasted,3
Our dog loves this food very much!,5
Needs more bacon.,3
"Bought this for our cat. It was a bit big even for out 18 lb cat, so we returned it for a smaller size, but the reflectiveness and fit would have worked perfectly for a smallish dog",4
Great item everything as advertised,5
"Very durable. Lasts a long time, even with my dog who pulls constantly when he walks!",5
"These beds are really soft. My dogs seem to really enjoy Lounging around on them. Their easy to pick up and move from one place to another. Easy to clean too, just throw them in the washing machine then dry on low or I even use no heat air dry that works well too.",5
"I purchased this item with the intention of helping my dog up the stairs, but it did not work for her because she has a problem in the rear department not the chest area where this item works. I use a stretchy large rubber band from a exercise kit and it works well for her back end problem,but it is wearing out and I need to find another one. This product is good for dogs that need to be helped from the front end or chest area. It also did not fit her right. I even tried to reverse it and fit it on her backend, but it did not work. She can get her front legs up on the step, but needs help with her rear legs.",3
it does make the difference after applying this stuff and cleaned off the tear eye marks on her face,5
"all my dogs seem to like this flavor, however after repeat purchases of the ""chicken & rice"" which consists of small pieces of freeze dried looking pieces of chicken, this lamb & rice only contains larger triangle shapes of dry dog food; no meat-like pieces like I expected. I believe I will stick with the chicken & rice next time. I can feed my smaller chihuahuas the chicken & rice flavor, not this because it has larger kibble",4
this has lasted over two months and she still chews on it daily.  my dog is a 40 pound blue heeler 8 month puppy.  This does keep her occupied.  It gets a little rough to handle for playing tug of war with her.,5
My cats don't seem to like the chewy rawhide like texture.  Have to go back to the paste or granules.,2
Fast shipping! Great product!,5
My Yorkie Romeo Absolutely Loves These Treats And He Is Quite Picky ! He Gets All Excited When I Take Them Out Of The Fridge And Give Him One A Day. I Do Refrigerate The Bag After Opening So They Stay Fresh. They Have Good Ingredients And Are Safe For Your Dog To Eat. Just Remember They Are A Snack Not To Be Used As A Daily Meal.,5

i love to have these on hand. my cat enjoys them and they work great.,5
"Pump is pretty quiet. At first my dog was skeptical of it, but now he likes it. When bubbles rise in the tank, it can sound like someone knocking on the door. I bought the cleaning brushes so I can do weekly maintenance.",4

I put the 240gph in my 40g breeder it runs along side an eheim 2215 canister filter and with the to combined it is just the right amount of flow. The fish aren't struggling yet all of the plants are gently moving. I'm glad I went with the 240 I think the 425 would have blown my plants sideways,5
"This is AMAZING!  My aunt recommended it after our dog ran off & wouldn't come back when called.  A trainer had recommended it to her because an excited dog can run through an electric/wireless fence then be scared to come back through because of getting shocked.  This works up to 1/2 mile away which is great when you live in the country!  We used the vibration button & 98% of the time it is all that is needed if calling didn't work.  We've only had to use the shock button 2x.  The shock for our small dog is no more than a tap similar to a small prick on the finger, but enough that it gets her attention to come.  The change of calling come and her responding correctly without any sort of reminder (vibration) has been amazing since day one!  Now our dog can enjoy our entire property without being confined to a small area.",5
"no hanger on top, bad quality doest worth the cost.",2
The smaller size is gentle and loved by my kitties!!,5
"Always buy these products outside, but purchasing thru Amazon, great!",5
"This is a good, solid Milk Bone product.  The softness of these are easier on my older dog's teeth and she seems to really like them.",5
"This chicken and oatmeal version of Beyond rated very high with Clean Label Project. I did some comparisons and I feel that this is a relatively good food for the price.
 Another important factor is that she really likes it. I put it side by side with her much more expensive food and she preferred this.
The more expensive food rated pretty low with CLP.
She free feeds, she maintains an appropriate weight and is happy and healthy.",4
This cat litter scoop is very sturdy and has a convenient loop attached to the handle. It is very easy to use and makes scooping a breeze.,5
"Very good product, helps our 9 year old Golden Retriever.  Before taking Dasuquin he had aches, pains and slowly got up from a prone position.
After taking Dasuquin for several weeks he began to do  things like he was several years younger with no aches or pains.  For whatever reason he is more lively and runs more than before taking the Dasuquin.  Do your dog a favor and try it, it works.",5
"I have purchased both the green and brown 55 gallon reptile carpets and am impressed with them. They make the habitat look nice, and they are very easy to clean. I personally like the brown color better, since my bearded dragon's terrarium is a ""desert"" theme. I like these better than sand and Repti-bark, since there is no way a beardie can accidentally ingest this. It is safer in my opinion, and better.

The only downsides are when your reptile is shedding, the pieces of skin can ""stick"" to the carpet and be hard to pick up. When my dragon is shedding, he scratches his head on everything and the little pieces of dead skin go everywhere. It's not a big deal, but makes cleaning the carpet a little more difficult. Another downside is when there is a urate, it can stain the carpet. It comes out when you clean it, but sometimes I see smudges even after I've picked up after my dragon. Since my Bentley typically goes in the same areas in his terrarium, I just put paper towels on those spots.

Overall, I really like the Eco-Carpet and would buy it again!",5
Its super cute!!  It fits my 5lb yorkie perfect!,5
Not the same ones I purchased before.  These are much smaller and you need to give 2-3 times more tabs than the other GrassSaver.  It does work as my grass does not turn yellow/die after my 2 male dogs go.  I give them with a dab of peanut butter.,3
My West Highland White Terriers Love these treats!! Blue Buffalo makes a solid product that I don't fear to feed my dogs. I can get my dogs to do most anything for one of these treats. My five year old likes when I hide them throughout the house so he can hunt them down. He is very good at finding them. I have a 10 week old puppy that has already learned to sit and lay down thanks to these treats!,5
My dog loves these made in the USA chews. Would purchase again.,5
I wouldn't trust anything other than Advantix II,5
My cat loves treats and I decided to try these since they were grain free and would be healthier.  He turned his nose up at them and refused to try them.  I gave them to my parents whose cat also loves treats and she did eat one and refused to eat anymore.,1
Was not what I thought it was.  It is useless to me and I can't use it.  I'm sorry that I bought it.,1
"I got this because I worried about my dog's joints. At first, she didn't like it. But after I trained her to use it, she is keep using it. It was hard to assemble though.",5
lasts long and keeps the guys busy,5
This has been very helpful for my occasionally incontinent dog...........,5
Looks nice but took a long time to arrive.,5
My dog shreds tennis balls so these are great.  He loves chasing them and because of their odd bounce he's never quite sure where the ball is going.,5
Very hardy rope. My dog is furious that it won't give him his ball.,4
This works really well with one of our cats.  He is a complete jerk and only these seem to help.  Too bad they don't make them for public places...  Just sayin',5
For the price you should go with another filter. I have replaced the filters in this 3 times this month. the water just seems to run over the filters unless they are brand new,1
"This is a helpful training tool, but since my cat tends to go bonkers he bunches it up and then still scratched my rug. But it is fun to watch him play with it now that he is used to it.",3
Good to cushion a crate when it's cold outside.,3
"Nice well made product. Good value. I felt it had too much polyfill so I removed some and added a few sprinkles of catnip inside. The snubbed toy became a hit with 1 out of my 3 cats. My 8 lb cat seemed a bit intimidated by it and my 13 pound will more than likely use an overstuffed one to rest her head on in the window frame. Ribbon on ends is sewn on but you are able to slide it up to access center portion if you want to modify toy like I did. My 15 pound big solid boy, Meiko, loves it and enjoys kicking, hugging and wresting with it. FYI The toy is not small; he is really big. Recommend for big cats or for chin rests along window sills as rubber necking can be exhausting.  I received really cute patterns; the faux fur is short napped but soft.",4
"easy to use, chart hard to read.",4
"For a strong chewer, this toy is fantastic. My dog routinely destroys almost every toy I get him, but this hollow stick has been holding up very well. He's put some teeth marks on the little stubs that stick out, but this toy is nowhere near the end of its life yet.",5
My dogs love these.,5
My cat's didn't like it.  Back to Purina,4
Worked great on my Yorkie!,5
"This harness is soft and was comfortable for my dog, but she is a very strong ""puller"" and after her lurching forward several times the harness stretched out and twisted around. If you are buying this to hold on to a hyper dog, this is not the harness to get. I ended up buying a ""no pull"" harness that has the leash latch in the front.",2
This item is good and is as described on Amazon. It's good for one's cat to keep the cat's urinary tract healthy.,5
awesome.. good quality,5
dogs don't like it.,3
My puppy weighs 9 lbs.  It fits him perfect but the latch is so hard to unlock.  I just don't have the muscle to do it and have to get someone else to do it for me.,4
"This product is WONDERFUL and it REALLY WORKS  without fear of crushing the dog's larynx.  My puppy didn't like it when I first put it on
but I needed to have control of him.  He is 7 months old and 68lbs. and energy packed!  After the second time, he is all for it!  All I have to say
is...(Do you want to go walking) VOILA!!!!!  Kay",5
My dog loves it. He ripped out most of the squeakers.,5
Works great.,5
"I was ready to hate this stuff.  I figured it was snake oil and likely didn't do anything more for calming a cat down than a sugar pill would cure cancer in a human.  However, when my initial batch of Feliway ran out I noticed a negative change in behavior in my kitten.  She started destroying some stuff in the house.  Feliway arrived and she's calmed down, a lot.  So, I guess you could say I'm convinced.  I've got two going right now to try to calm down my existing kitten and the new kitten I just adopted to ease the introductions.  I'm sure things would be even more difficult sans Feliway.",4
"Fits perfectly of course. So far its holding up and doing what its meant to do. They should sell this as fine, medium, coarse.",3
"Easy to get on and off. I use it with a seat belt clip on the back to hold the pup in the car. He knows what it is and can't shove his head in the hole fast enough when he sees it. I have a 13 pound maltese / cavalier king charles spaniel mix. He's of medium bulk (not thick, not slender - very average proportions) and the medium fits well.",5
Good product.  Will order again.,4
Perfect for our cockatiel,5
"We ordered this to help our dog who has an allergy to leaf mold.  It is doing a good job of creating a barrier when we are out in the woods and he is running through the leaves.  The material does not get in the way when he relieves himself.  It can't protect the groin area and we have been spreading petroleum jelly on the bare skin.  Between the chest protector and the salve, the situation is greatly improved.",5
Works on my Jack Russell.,5
"My dogs were split on weather they liked the chew tabs. But, I swear they look shinier since taking this product.",4
MY DOG LOVES IT.  IT HAS A PEPPERMINT AROMA TO IT.  IT IS STURDY AND A GOOD VALUE.  I WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN.,5
This is a great product   very attractive and very sturdy and our big dog loves it. It really aids in the digestion of large dogs.,5
excellent product and company!! Super strong.. I have a 54 pound and still growing pup .. highly recommend.,5
Cat loves this scratcher/lounger and uses it as both.,5
Love them.  Keep a box within reach of every litter box.  Very strong.,5
"They are very good quality and my dog loves them.  They are also sold at my vet, but the price is very high.",5
"Our dog, who is prone to allergies (grain, we think) is very limited in the treats he can have because he will scratch for 2 weeks after eating an allergy-inducing treat. We've tried to find something he likes and doesn't get bored with, and these are the winner! This is the 2nd big bag we've bought, and he loves them. I love the limited ingredient formula, there are a lot of treats in the bags, they break apart easily, and they don't dry out and harden over time. Great treats!",5
Works great and my dog loves it. Will buy again.,5
Great buy as described. will buy another.,5
"These are sharp, safe and easy to use. Love them for my new puppy!",5
Overall a great toy but the crossover wires popped out the ends fairly quickly. I will stitch up holes and it should be fine.,4
"All four of our cats have rejected this litter box.  It has been sitting beside the other style of pan that we bought at the same time and only one of them has ever given it a ""go"".  And that was it.  We used to have several bucket type pans in the past but evidently our cats hated them.  Good to know.",2
wow this stuff is really pretty & works great.  we try to change hamster cage fully every week.  this really keeps any smell down & they love it.  in past used the wood chips but never again.  only this product.,5
"My scotty has had problems with recurrent ear infections her whole life.  She is 10 years old.  Barring using the prescription dog food by Science Diet ""D/D"" [I believe it's called], this is next best.

So far we have excluded Duck and Salmon proteins from causing her problems.  Also..read the label.  The food is high quality, consisting of 50% protein.  The rest is pears, cranberries, pumkin, blueberries, lavender, rosehips, turmeric, chicory root powder.  Nothing weird.  Real food.

Keep in mind I am discussing the ""Acana SINGLES"" line by Amana  (with only a single , ounce protein).

Typically it is the protein component of dog food that is to blame for dog food allergies
  This food has been very effective at helping us determine what proteins she can have (the dog).  On top of that, she truly likes this food.  Yes it's expensive..but so is a 350 dollar trip to the vet for ear infections.

Side note: the Amana food I purchase is made in Canada..I am not sure what the Alabama manufacture process is about?

Interesting aside:  The protein source in this food must be high, and high quality.  I have 2 cats, one is Extremely picky...she will not eat human food nor any cat treats (except for one specific brand).  this cat, along with the other, have both determined that when I feed my dog, that they need this food too.  They run when they hear me open the dogs food bin, and they wait for me to scoop it out.  They truly live this food, and they have NEVER given a rats ass about my dogs food before, let alone devoured it.  Key dog is 10!...the cats have been around my dog for 5 years).",5
"When my retriever-poodle developed an autoimmune disease, her joints hurt.  The high-dose prednisone used to treat the disease caused her to pant heavily and seek the coolest surfaces -- usually the bathroom tile floor.  So I wanted to find a bed that would not only provide soft comfort, but also the cooling she needed.

This worked!  After a few weeks of occasionally placing treats on it, she got used to the water motion and started using the bed regularly.  I purchased the largest size bed, plus the optional bolster/cover, and placed it in our shaded, enclosed porch.

I've known several dog-owners who've bought other brands of this type bed and didn't like them.  Others who  bought this one and said their dog never used it.  My advice is to get this one, and then to use some form of positive reinforcement to get your dog over the initial wariness of the water motion.",5
Dogs hate it but it works!,5
"Works well, and my dog enjoys it.  I haven't tried it during a bath, but I'm looking forward to trying it.",4
Adequate description. Functions as described.,4
Product came quickly and was exactly as described.,5
"It is not genuine leather as it was claimed. The label on the collar is clearly stated it was ""bonded leather""
I like the collar it looks very nice so I didnn't return it. But I don't like the idea it was mispresented. For this price it is a great collar.",3
Our dogs LOVE it!,5
Very nice heater. Packaged well and made of good quality glass. Excellent value for money.,4
"This is a nice pate type of food that remains soft, even when left in the frig.  The dogs devour it and don't seem to have the allergic responses of chewing their feet after eating it.  The smell isn't off-putting and I like the pull-tab at the top.",5
"This is a good product, for people that want to keep their pets in good health. My dog sasha is easier t5o handle with it. Thank You for making it easy to find and get.",4
This gate is very nice and looks great...Our dog just sees the gate and walks away once she found out the slats are too close to get through.........if you have a chewer you may want to put something on the bars to deter that because they are wood....we use the gate to keep our dog off the rooms with carpet....fits in with our decor....,5
My cat likes it very much.,5
"My lab felt the softest I can remember after just one use of this the Oatmeal and Aloe shampoo!  I suggest using it in conjunction with their Creme Rinse and Conditioner as it intensifies the effect.  Also, to make it easier to apply and last longer, I advise diluting it before applying it to your dog.  Enjoy giving your pet a new shine and softness that will make you never want to stop petting him/her :)",5
"My red eared slider turtle loves this food.  I'm so glad that you offer a big bag of it at such a great price.
Thank you so much.
Fast shipping, excellent service!  A+++",5
Easy set up good features highly recommend,5
"My dogs have both been eating taste of the wild since we brought them home 3.5 years ago.  No issues with this brand at all. We go through almost an entire 30 lb bad every month in our house, so I decided to subscribe to this item as a monthly subscription, so it shows up on my doorstep every month, and now I never have to worry about dragging my lazy ass out to the pet store late at night to make sure I have food for my guys for the next day... its always stocked, without worry! love it! The price through amazon is competitive with the pet stores. I no long can use coupons at the store like I could occasionally before getting it in store, but the fact that I don't have to drive to the pet store every month is worth the extra few bucks.",5
"My finicky 10-year old American Eskimo loves these treats. He limps less every day. They started working for him after only a few days. He doesn't like the joint formula ""pill-type"" varieties of other brands, but he really loves these.",5
"Super cheap plastic junk. My dog trashed this the first time he used it, after doing well with other slow feeders for months. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Trying other brands, will update.",1
Great price. My grocery store is so expensive on these. Check prices. Great buy. My dog loves them and they do help to keep his teeth clean.,5
Perfect for what I need.,5
Our large lab loves this ball but it's too small for his big mouth. I wouldn't recommend it for large dogs.,4
"My dog used this a few times, but to be fair she just is extremely confused constantly about where she should or should not go to the bathroom so... it def wasn't a magic solution for me, the shipping charge is crazy high and it wasn't worth it to me to continue paying. It is a very cool idea and I think for the right dog and situation it could be a game changer.. Just wasn't for me. I live in a 3rd floor apartment and my dog is a ChiWeenie so she needs to go very frequently and I thought this would be great but it died rather fast, she dug in it a lot, and it rained and then the box got pretty soggy on my deck soo... meh.",3
Used these for several months and they don't work at all.,1
"The puppy really loves this and it took her a little while to get through it! our older dog also enjoyed the treats but it took her only a few seconds to get through it, so save these for the true puppies!",5
"My 3 cats adored these! Really enlivened a dull winter's night. They spent a good half hour with these, Nd then went back to them several times.",5
Good,4
"I bought this to replace a cloth and wire puzzle toy we previously had.  The cats don't seem to like this one as much, but they still play with it.  It's also an attractive way to store all the small cats toys.",4
"Doggie did not like it,  she ate it after many hours of not eating, do not know why  I was very happy to show her this new food, I am trying a different flavor next time",3
Only food my cat will eat!,5
"Gave this to my doctor's little dog for Christmas, and she said he loved it, and hid it under the tree!!",5
My dragons won't eat it.,3
"Kids love these, but warning, they are VERY fishy smelling! Lol, not for everyone",5
"I bought this food because my cat has tummy issues, and someone's blog said this was the way to go. My cat wouldn't eat the food, however, so I am unable to say whether or not it would work. I tried everything, cutting it up, mashing it, mixing in food he likes. Oh well. I'm going to donate the rest to the shelter. I'm sure its great.",2
"So far, this has been the only toy our Boston Terrier hasn't been able to chew a hole in or chew the squeaker out of. She loves it!",5
JUST REALLY GOOD,5
My cat loves this stew but I hate the foil packaging.  It's impossible to open the packet without getting it on your hands and impossible to get all the product out of the packet. That's the reason I can only give it 3 stars.,3
"Great value, shipped fast and good quality",5
My dog loves these! The pieces are big so I break them up and use for training with my dog. He gets a small piece after his walks. I will continue ordering these.,5
PThis is a great design for brushing all sides of my little dogs' teeth. Fairly easy to handle. Will be ordering more soon.,4
"Skinneeez are great! No stuffing or small parts for big chewers to destroy and/or swallow. My German Shepherd loves to carry this toy around in her mouth. The squeakers eventually die, but they last pretty long so they're still worth the price. We always have a few Skinneeez on hand!",5
Received exactly what I expected.,5
Definitely helped with the itch. It doesn't have a smell which could be bad or good depending on your expectations. Non greasy and non irritating. Good buy.,4
My dogs love this chicken. Hey just love the flavor and begs for more. I only wish that it was softer for my aging dogs. I like their product line which I have continue to purchase,5
"the 2 boxers love them and i have reordered several times, i trusted all the reviews.  time will tell how much they help, ive only used them about 6 months, great value",5
great//,5
"These are nice, hard, tennis balls- not ""real"" tennis balls which are dangerous for dogs because they can split them more easily and choke on them",4
this is not an easy thing to put on.  it's hard to even get the prong for the buckle through the holes.  i have no idea where the clip is supposed to officially go so had to make something up.  my dog's collar won't fit through the loop at the bottom so had to improvise there as well.  the hard plastic around the muzzle has to be incredibly uncomfortable.  I don't use it often because it's difficult and not very secure.,2
"Great deal on a litter box.  Get the add-on reduced one and you'll save!  There is a little dip on the bottom tray that needs to be scraped a little when cleaning, but it's not a big deal for the price.  My cat took to it immediately and my 2nd cat that is normally very picky about sharing her box has adopted this as her box as well now and is SHARING with the other kitty.  I am going to need more of these! I absolutely LOVE that it comes with a scoop that attaches to the lip for storing!  I have been thinking this would have been a great idea for years!!! You can clip it on anywhere along the top side facing inside and the kitties seem to leave it alone now.  The very first day they knocked it off once to probably see what it was, but it has not been an issue.  The clip also doesn't have to wide of gaps and is smaller so little bits don't fall through as often.  I waited a few weeks to post this review to put it to the test and I would definitely purchase it again.  GREAT FIND!!!",5
"easy to use, strong clasp, leather is easy on the hand. this was the third one i have bought and as more dogs come i will get more",5
"I did not have a choice on a color and received a see through green hut.  The purpose of the hut is to provide a private place where my guinea pigs can go.  With the see through, light color, they don't get that privacy.  They both prefer the dark purple one that I have for them.",3
"thought it would be softer.  very hard,",2
The value of this set was tremendous! I bought these so that I could find out which ones my dog like the most. Seems that they are all his favorite!,5
"Bought two for my kitties and they have managed to move the litter mat out of their way daily since they must not like the feel of the soft bristles designed to capture their litter as they haul out of their boxes. I put the mats underneath their litter boxes but cats are smart and have no trouble re-arranging their room to their liking.  8-)

The mats are purrrrfect (meow).",4
"Love them, just wished they were more reasonably priced.",5
"Initially, I purchased another brand of pet monitor unit designed by a teen. That unit worked well, however, it proved not stable with higher end internet speeds and system updates; which was my case living in the NYC greater area.  I totally LOVE LOVE LOVE our  Pet Chatz unit AND the customer support received. I love the peace of mind I get knowing that I can check on my fur-kids throughout the day or when I'm traveling throughout the US or abroad. I've been using this unit to remind and reinforce proper toileting for the pups.  I've even used our Pet Chatz to assist with de-escalating my students in crisis (as a distraction) at the schools I've worked in! I encourage everyone who has pets, to invest in the best system for pet monitoring on the market. I can hear and see my fur kids, and they can hear and see me. It also, has a sensory feature that emits a calming sense upon activation. Although, you can probably use a variety of treats, (using an empty Pet Chatz treat container) I've never had reason to do so. I control the amount of treats I drop daily to my pets, so I've not ever used any treat brand. There are other monitors, but you definitely get what you pay for in the pet monitoring market. If you can, afford to, I'd suggest you get the latest version, Pet Chatz HD with the Pet Call feature. It allows your fur kid to contact you!  How great is this feature??? I see the upgrade in our family's future.",4
Heavy duty scoop with a nice long reach.,5
"Wonderful kibble for our puppy, except he's now a big puppy. No allergic reactions to this brand.",4
"This is a great size for my 9lb Yorkie, It's good quality & she loves it.",5
"Zuko, our four-year-old black cat likes this scratching pad toy more than any other.  Buying refills saves $$$$$$$$$$$!!!",5
"We visited the local pet supply store and found leashes like this going for between $25 and $30. We were able to purchase this leash for under $15. It is strong, well-made, and highly functional. We will be enjoying this purchase for a long time.",5
Great toy for a super chewer.  There are recipes for fillings you can make at home online also.,5
"These are great puppy pads, the size is big enough that they can actually aim on it and it's durable so it's not messy to clean up. I wish I would've got these sooner!",5
"So happy I discovered these. No more cleaning litter boxes. Just bag it, toss it, and drop another one down. Incredibly sturdy and last a long time. And can't complain about the price.",5
Bought this and another size for our two Newfoundlands.  They develop a really thick undercoat.  Can't say enough about the effectiveness of these tools.,5
My dog really loved these,5
"My dog loved it. It breaks in a million pieces, so some dogs might choke on it!",3
I am so happy with this purchase. The was so impressed when I first opened the package. My dogs relax in the car because they feel more comfortable in the fabric. I vacuum it after they are in the car and it cleans up so easy. It does not slide like other canopys I have owned do. I plan on watching for when it goes on deal again and buying two more for my kids who own dogs.,5
The best scooper in the market so far.,5
"My little dog love these treats, thank you for my order!",5
A must have,5
"Great product I have numerous Parrots and cleaning up is less work on there cages, I spend more time playing with them and not the cages",5
"way too small, not right information",2
Plastic base is cheap and the legs fall off whenever i move it.  They won't stay clipped in.  Bowels are pretty good size and quality but the base is junk,2
"My dog loves these. They could be a bit thicker (I've purchased better quality bully sticks), but for the price they're great, and my dog chews them down to a nub. I have a 15 lb. Maltese for reference.",5
Cute! The small fits my 4.5-5lb dog. The medium fits my 6-7lb dog and my 7-8lb dog.,5
"Fit my giant cat, and the bottom cushion looks pretty comfy.",5
Purchased for our large lab that needed a little help walking nicely on the leash.  She was a rescue and never taught.  After introducing her and then walking her in the head halter it has made a world of difference.  No more heavy panting while she's trying to drag us along.,5
Squeaker didn't work.,2
"Definitely WATCH THE VIDEO... the only thing they need to do is show how big, or small, this is. The mechanics of the device are clever. I think the statement that is will hold 2 weeks of business is over the top. And you need to use the expensive ""clumping"" litter, the inexpensive clay doesn't work too well in the mechanism.",4
My dogs love these!!!,5
"quite easily replaced my old one on my aquarium, was tons cheaper than Petco!!!!!!",5
"My 14-year-old dog, Max, will never be the big strong dog he always was. However, with these, he has been able to get some of his movement back, after having a very couple of bad months, and he seems more comfortable than he has been in a long time. I give him three pills twice a day, and I don't know if it's the extra glucosamine, or the combination of herbs, or what, but he is interacting better with us now than he has for a while. I'm buying a bigger bottle of these next time, as I think they're a great product. No, they're not a miracle cure, but they have helped my dog live more comfortably for the time I still have him, and for that, I wish they had even more stars on this review.",5
"Very nice cat tree condo however, some of the feature like the hammock and openings are too small for my 12lbs cats. They love laying on it and use the scratching posts all the time.",4
My 3 pugs love it . Feed it over there dry  food everyday ! They love,5
"When first purchased, it was slightly rigid. Once I twisted it a little bit, I was able to easily get it around the dog tag. It's mostly quiet and we really enjoy the glow in the dark feature. Highly recommend!",5
"This looks great and I loved that it added a little bit of plushness for one of my older dogs.  Unfortunately the pad completely ripped apart at the seams after washing on the gentle cycle.  I'm so disappointed. I will still use the cover, but definitely will not repurchase for our other Kuranda beds.",2
This crate is just perfect for what we needed. We have a smallish dog and it's the perfect size for him.  I love the fact that there are two doors...one on the end and one on the side.  This allowed us to fit it into the space allotted for it without the crate sticking out so far.,5
Great for Cats,5
"My dog hates the taste of these.  I give him his pills in a spoonful of canned cat food.  He gets 2 spoonfuls.  The only way I can get these into him, is to slip him one in between the 2 spoonfuls, because he knows he won't get the 2nd spoonful until he swallows this thing.  I don't know if they help him or not because he can't talk to tell me.  He's 14, his hips are pretty bad, and he's on several prescriptions for them.  Maybe these help, maybe they don't.",2
My horse loves this Jolly Ball! She is super playful with it and its holding up very well! I have it in her stall mounted on a rope in top of stall on a joist.,5
Got it as a Christmas gift for a Wire Fox Terrier.  Lasted about an hour before he tore it apart. Will not be buying anymore. Price is not cheap enough for an hours worth of use. I thought it seemed heavy enough to last but maybe if you don't have an aggressive chewer.,1
My Boston terrier loves these treats. She can't wait to hide these treats to create a stash. Good product and just the right size.,5
"If my cats could rate this, I think they'd give it a 5 star. They love the taste of it and they are VERY picky cats. Ingredient quality isn't exactly what I'd expect a food of this price range to have, but it's not so bad that I feel I shouldn't feed it to them, unlike many other foods from Hills where I balk at the ingredients. You can certainly get higher ingredient quality foods for this price, however, so if your cats aren't as picky as mine I would definitely look into those foods. The biggest problem is that much of the protein in this food comes from peas, the second ingredient in the food, even if the first ingredient is chicken. Chicken, prior to cooking (which is when ingredient amounts are determined), is a very water-dense ingredient. Anyone who has ever cooked chicken knows that it shrinks significantly as it is being cooked, thus, it can be presumed that a decent portion of the protein percentage in this food comes from peas as opposed to a meat source. I prefer to have a named meat source and a named meat meal source in the first two ingredients of my cat food. Chicken meal isn't listed until the 10th or 11th ingredient in this food, after some creepy stuff like hydrolyzed chicken liver. As this isn't meant to be an allergen free food, I really don't see why hydrolyzed chicken liver was necessary. I feel that the fact that meal is so low on this list is likely because of the stigma surrounding the term ""meal"" when named non-by-product meals are actually a wonderful, protein rich ingredient. Cats cannot utilize proteins from sources other than meat, so it's not ideal to have peas as a protein source. It gives one a skewed idea of how much protein is actually in the food.

This food, from the packaging with a beautiful piece of cooked chicken with veggies on the front to the actual ingredients to the idea of a ""small batch"" and ""gently cooked"" food, is very targeted towards a consumer that projects their own eating habits onto their pets. Nothing wrong with that, but recognize that a lot of effort went into how this food is presented and a lot of the cost comes from this sort of marketing. The cost does not necessarily reflect the quality of the food the way that one might think it would based on the old ""you get what you pay for"" adage, which is often true with pet food.

All of that being said, it does come off as a very fresh food when you open the bag. It smells good and the food has a very fresh, almost kind of oily look to it. It even has a slightly higher moisture content than other dry kibble. Moreover, as I said, the cats totally love it. I don't know that it has done anything positive for their coats or skin or anything like that -- I just feel like I so rarely see changes in them from food -- but I am pleased with it and will buy it whenever I happen upon a good coupon which I can often get from a Hills representative. That's my biggest beef with it: the price. I wouldn't mind it if the ingredients reflected the quality of the food, but they simply do not. When I can buy cheaper, higher quality food, this is only worth it when I get a good discount.",4
My dogs will not take their medicine unless it is hidden.  I take two pill pockets & wrap completely around the pill & they love it!!,5
Very necessary when you have an aquarium a shallow mine is 40 cm high and with this extension reaches almost to the bottom for the filter to pick up water from the bottom and not superficial.,5
Best thing that has ever happened to me. I buy off brand pad inserts but I haven't found a good alternative to the pellets.  There is a store on amazon that sells the pellets 6- 3.5 lbs for $36 which isn't too bad.,5
"This worked well,  but is not water resistant.  If your dog gets in any water, it will become ruined in a heartbeat.  So, if there is any chance that your dog will get loose and roll in a puddle... get a waterproof collar.",4
I purchased these to put in my dog carrier for an upcoming in cabin trip by air.  Just what I wanted.  It has sticky tabs to keep it in place in the carrier and has a backing in case my dog has an accident it won't absorb through the liner into the crate.  Just a wonderful disposable travel pad.  It reminds me of a disposable diaper in a way but is made to go in the bottom of a crate or puppy purse.,5
"Garbage. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. It ripped my grass every time I used it, and worst part it wouldn't pick up the poop.",1
They a little pricey but my dog loves them,5
"Got it yesterday. It took my 10 month old Black Lab under 10 minutes to make the first hole in one of the feet. The stuffing and the squeaker were all out in the next 2 hours. BUT, it's very cute, and the unstuffed alligator has managed to stay around for the past 24 hours without further damage. It is adorable! Guess Black Labs are just too tough for any toys! LOL",3
"She won't take her nose out of this ball until every speck of treat has been consumed. We don't have a lot of behavior/boredom problems with her, so I can't say whether this solved those problems. I can say that she was definitely occupied with this thing, and that she seemed very happy to go to her corner and work on this. She even tried to take it outside for her bathroom breaks.",5
"I actually think the no tracking pads track more than the previous less expensive version.  The pads do a really good job holding odor, but there seems to be a delay between when urine hits the pad and when it soaks into the core.",3
dogs loved it and it lasted a long time,4
"Our cats love the freeze dried raw food. They didn't care for the frozen kind (and I don't like waiting for it to defrost either), but they do love the freeze dried kind. We make sure to give more water than is recommended per serving to be safe, and they don't mind at all. It's a bit expensive (all raw food is) so we only use this for one of their meals a day. My cats prefer the chicken/salmon flavor over the turkey. Haven't tried beef yet.",5
"I bought this to walk my lab mix. My previous retractable leash was something cheap I picked up at Target. Hands down, this is much nicer and better designed. It actually retracts very smoothly, which is a huge plus. My dog is older, so she doesn't strain at the leash, unless of course she spots a squirrel or rabbit. Even then, the leash is able to contain her easily. I also like the color as it matches her collar. The only criticism I would have is that the handle is slightly small. I will be curious as to how snug this will be once I wear gloves in the winter. I don't have man hands like my friend Stacey, so I should be just fine. Overall, I would purchase this product again and recommend it to all dog owners.",4
"This product smells like tires and was made in China, not the US as advertised.
Returning product.",1
Perfect to keep dogs put in back seat,5
Too small for my larger hermit crabs but the smaller ones took to it right away!,4
Great lamps. A better choice than two separate bulbs. My beardie and RES really seem to like them.,5
"I tried clipping my long-haired cat with my regular hair clippers and she expressed her displeasure in a particularly foul way.  I hope none of you learn about this ability they have first-hand.  I spoke with her previous owner, knowing that she had groomed the cat herself.  I paid $85 for one grooming!!  She told me about these clippers, and it seemed worth the gamble.
I tried using one of the attachments, but they just bogged down with all the fur.  I think it was pulling on it too.  Cat = not happy.
I removed the attachment and just lowered the blade as much as I could.  I was a barber in the Navy and have experience using clippers.  The groomer told me that with cats, you only have one choice and that is to shave them.  She also said they have paper thin skin (she cut my kitty and had the nerve to say that wound was already there).
My cat does not like being held down at all, and that is the biggest obstacle, not the clippers.
What I like best:
1.  Cordless - I was able to come at her from any angle and follow her around the house and even shave her while she was eating!
2.  Silence - The clippers are not completely silent, BUT they are extremely quiet in comparison to regular hair clippers.
3.  Sharp - My cat has a TON of fur and these clippers shaved it off very easily once I gave up on the attachments.
4.  Safe - I did not injure my kitty at all.

Now, I cannot claim total success because my cat won't hold still for very long.  She actually seemed to enjoy the light vibration on her skin.  I have yet to complete her grooming because I am too chicken to shave her pits because of the skin folds in that area.  I did most of the grooming without another person restraining her.
The clippers are well worth the investment!  No clouds of fur drifting through the air at our house anymore.  And my husband actually likes the cat now that she doesn't leave him drowning in fur.",5
Good toy,5
"These little tips keep all but the tiniest insects out. BIG improvement over not having them, and the little hummers don't mind a bit.",5
"Like I expected, it kept my two adult cats moderately entertained and after a few days they consistently ignore it. Probably a great product for kittens.",4
"We have a one year old Rottie, and although he's as sweet as can be he's also terrifically destructive at times given his size and strength. The heavy, thick rubber Kong products have lasted, but not much else, and those heavier products have a tendency of bashing into walls, windows, and other things and causing damage due to their mass and firmness.

On a whim, I got one of these Crackle toys, and from the looks of it I didn't expect it to last - boy, was I wrong. First, he *loves* this thing (or things, we've now purchased several more, including the Crackle ball), and fusses with it constantly. It doesn't squeak, but it does make a crackling sound by virtue of the fact that it's actually two layers, one slightly larger and completely surrounding the interior layer, and when the outer layer is squashed far enough to impact the inner layer, it makes a crackling sound.

These are much less dense than the heavy rubber Kong toys, so there are fewer dangers when they are thrown, tumble down the stairs, etc. So far they have withstood his most focused attacks without a scratch. I hope their durability keeps up, because if so these will become our go-to toy from now on.

Note that we've had them for several months now, so this isn't a day-one review or anything, he's had ample time to destroy them and he hasn't yet. Highly recommended.",5
"I have two cats, and they look great in them! Albeit for a little while! It was perfect for our xmas pictures!",3
Seemed way smaller than the usual size.  Dingo trying to save money again!!!,1
Have very picky cats and they will gobble these down quickly and will not share. For my cats it has to be seafood. Most of my cats will eat both sides of the package and one side will not be quite enough. One extra fact is that these containers are very easy to rinse clean and to recycle the whole container which is a plus.,5
"Used a similar product fm Walmart for my last fog.  Worked like magic.  Our new dog spits these out and he is NOT acpicky eater.  Hry Naturvet, what's with the taste???",2
"I really love this leash.  Doesn't tangle due to the swivel at the junction.  Matches one of my dog's collars perfectly (idk why that makes me happy but it does lol).  Easy to connect, padded handle is nice.  Very sturdy without being heavy for our little dogs.  Woven connections are nice, better than a crimped metal piece that could fatigue after time.  Highly recommend.",5
"Pleasant smell, works well- have has no repeat episodes since I used",5
Excellent,5
"These have been fantastic for monitoring tanks during in-fish cycles.  It doesn't allow you to totally stop testing, but reduces the urge to test morning, noon and night.  Plus, after the tank is cycled it is a nice monitoring system to ensure any crash is detected before the fish tell you so!  I love these and now have them in every tank I own plus some spares.",5
"My dog Blue loves this ball!  He has to play with it several times a day, he loves pushing it around the yard or barking at it.  Its the first ball i've bought that he has not be able to destroy. If your dog has a strong jaw, and hyper personality then you HAVE to buy this 14 inch ball.",5
"This is an excellent bag to use for anything, not just for grooming. I can fit everything I need to take for the dog in this bag. It opens wide so you can easily see everything. Great color, too. It's made well so it should last a long time. I'm very happy with this purchase.",5
Way overpriced,3
"These are ok.  Pliable enough to stick in a little pill for my dog who's on daily medication.  Some days he'll eat it other days he'll snub it, he's a picky dog.  For medication I usually use cream cheese but I know it's high in fat for a little dog so that's why I changed to a lean treat.  He likes the cream cheese better.",3
our dogs favorite.,5
It's cute but it didn't even survive a week with our 2 pits and German Shepherd playing with it.,3
Prefer regular size,3
"I have a fat 17 pound maine coon who likes to knock over his water dish. So we needed something that held a lot. We started with the petmate fountain. I have had that a long time. I don't like it - he still tries to pull at it, scratching up the plastic inside and then it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. The thing collected dirt and mold like nobody's business so I was looking for something better. This water station so far is great. I can easily take out the stainless steel to clean, and it's so far scratch resistant. I am not filling the water constantly like I was with the water bowl or the petmate station. So far this is great.",4
"We got this for my dad's little dog, who logs a lot of air miles. It has nice features (like roll up window covers, front loading, side pocket).  My dad seems to like it, and so does his dog. I thought the quality was pretty nice, and I shopped around a lot before deciding on this one. It's hard to find a dog carrier that won't embarrass a man!  So far I haven't been disappointed.",5
Only purchased for the brushes and clip...however my bun loves that little strawberry!!!,5
Fairly large bag! Well worth the money!,4
"I have 3 highly active dogs and we live on 10 acres of wooded property. During hunting season, they always wear these outside. This brand is not durable enough for our needs. First, the velcro on the vests isn't very strong especially for dogs that are running through the woods and swimming in a creek. The fit of the strap that goes around their belly is not good either. It is much longer/bigger than it should be. All of my dogs are medium sized 50-55 lbs and I ordered the medium vest. All 3 vests are already falling apart after only 3 months. The seams are ripped and on one of them, our dogs managed to rip the material on top, probably on a fallen tree branch. A redeeming quality is that the material is a jersey-type material, which I liked since it is breathable and allows their fur to dry, but this is probably why the material is easier to tear. This product would be fine for low-activity dogs. For more active dogs, I would recommend the SafetyPup XD, which is a little pricier and different material, but holds up for longer (our last ones lasted over a year).",2
6 out of 6 huskies love this as much as they love the Nylabone wishbones. Woo! So glad for another great toy that can gnaw at safely. :] It's holding up very well like typical Nylabones.,5
Just what I needed.,5
"KONG is a very reliable brand of toys well-known for their strength. Trust me, the Kickeroos are extremely well-made and even after 6 months of hard play from a large kitten & two adult cats, they are in perfect shape. They have catnip in them, plus stuff that crinkles. These will delight your cats!",5
"I love these leashes.  The first one I bought lasted about 5 years (was still reflecting well, but looked pretty warn out).  I was very happy to see they were still available when I went looking again.  I also have the matching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rogz-Utility-Large-3-4-34-Fanbelt-Side-Release-Reflective-Dog-Collar-Red/dp/B002DX6R54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rogz Utility Large 3/4"" Fanbelt Side-Release Reflective Dog Collar, Red</a>.  Both work perfectly with my miniature schnauzer and my terrier mix mutt (both weigh +/- 15 pounds each). Maggie got red, and Coco got pink.",5
"My cats have a thing for scratching my leather couch, so I bought them a tree to try to lure them away. It didn't work. So I went and got a Bergan Turbo Scratcher, and they went nuts! They LOVE scratching at these things, so I was glad to find out that there are replacement pads. It figures that they like a cheapo cardboard toy better than a fancy cat tree...",5
This thing is huge and it also kinda leaks a little bit,2
"My dog isn't losing any weight, but he does like this food and it's ingredients are high quality.  Give it a try; your dog will like it.",5
Outstanding product. Has really helped with dog itching,5
"It sounded like an excellant food....and my dogs all loved it, but they got sick off of it...diarrhea and my puppy even vomited it back up...sticking with my other brand, Great Life Buffalo.",1
Very nice product,5
This is a great way to provide liver to your dog without the mess of cooking fresh etc.  My dogs love it!  I find that the beef holds up better...the last few turkey ones I got were almost all powder!,5
love this product,5
Easy to put up and good fit for my Havachon.,5
Item came as described and is a great value. Very happy with this purchase and recommend this product to others.,5
"This thing is awesome.  Unfortunately it arrived broken, but Amazon is easy to do returns with.  So sending it back and we'll get a new one.  The size is perfect for our crested gecko to be.  I have seen this brand in person and know they are well made.

Update, second one is also broken, returning for a refund this time.  Going to the store to get one so that I don't have to worry.  If time wasn't an issue I'd try one more time to see if ""third times is a charm"", but I can't.  I would say give it a try, it's a great product, but be prepared to have to send back a shattered one.  Luckily Amazon makes this issue fairly hassle free.",3
Adorable. And fits true to size,4
These are great for my Russian Toy dogs who are 2.5 pounds & 5 pounds.,5
"It's 9 days past the 30 day return threshold, so I cannot return this, but I would if I could!  This thing is coming apart at the seams and I only own one, 13 lb dog!  I also live in VA, where the weather has been quite temperate lately, so can't even begin to blame it on that!  This will not last....",1
My dogs like these. They are not their favourites but they do go back to them on and off until they are gone. I have ordered more than once and would order again primarily because they are one of the more reasonable treats made in the USA.,4
Love the small size and I can still snap in half (most of them)! Great little training treats with less worry about making fido porky!,5
"This item accomplishes the job of cleaning my dog's teeth, but the ""Peanut Butter"" flavor is totally misleading.  The paste smells like cooked lima beans and looks like translucent algae.  My dog hasn't minded having his teeth brushed for 5 years until now; he hates this stuff.",2
"I love this product greatly. Seachem is the BEST water conditioner available and I strongly recommend that all fish tank owners use this. It is very safe even if you add more than the recommended quantity. I have been using it over 7 years now and both my tanks have healthy, growing fish with lots of live plants.",5
"They rip apart pretty quick, even with little 20 pound dogs going at it.  It's one step up from the stuff the give to you for winning at the fair.",3
cats didn't like it either,2
Awesome tubing that can hold up to just about anything.,5
"This is essentially braided dry grass. For my guinea pig, it was uninteresting. He refused to do anything more than a couple nibbles before leaving and munching down on his Timothy Hay. As a cute little treat, it failed to prevail.",2
"Prompt and as described.  My gouramis seem very happy with this food. After a recent battle with white spot, I would recommend purchasing this food with  garlic. I tossed in crushed cloves of garlic instead and the fish seemed to enjoy it.",5
Arrived promptly.  Good buy; will purchase again.,5
it's still going!! most of all my other toys are in the to be sewn pile but gumby is still going strong after 1 year,5
"BADLY MADE AND CAME APART, BUT SELLER TOLD ME TO KEEP IT AND REFUNDED THE $$$$$",2
Nice decor.,5
"My hamster absolutely loves this toy.  It has stopped him from chewing the bars on his cage and it's fun to see him wrestle with it to get it down.  Highly recommended if you have a wire cage and a bar chewing problem, or if you have a hamster that is a picky chewer!",5
Another puppy favorite.,5
Easy to use and fairly quiet. Followed video directions that came with and YouTube. Love the cut and finished so quickly. Will never need to leave my little guy with a groomer again. The extra bonding time is a bonus. Every pet owner who want to learn a new skill should get one.,5
These things were instrumental in training my puppy.  I was able to train her to do so many things that I actually ran out of useful stuff to train her to do.  Now it's all just tricks.,5
"These are large, loud and ugly.  My cats were repelled.",1
This is a huge container! Probably at least 10x the amount Ive been buying at the store for only a couple of dollars more. Great deal!!,5
I love it....more important my 65 lb pit bull loves it.  We put her on it and she hasn't gotten off of it yet!  She was sleeping in my office chair and work and now she has her own bed.  Loves loves love it and it's huge so she can stretch out!,5
its been a year still looks new doggy loves it,5
"This bed is well-made and solid, easy to put together and very cute!  My new kittens like to sleep in it, among other places, such as under the bed!  As another reviewer said, you can put a blanket or padding on the bed to make it softer. Kittens may have preferred a dial by number bed or a Tem-purr-pedic, but they are happy with this one!",5
It does it's job as expected.,5
"My dog loved it for about 6 months, then she ate  it. I would buy again!",5
"Been using waterers with the same functions since the galvanized days. Needed this one for the dogs. Well made with several hose/connector adapters.

Best of all it comes from Marianna, FL!",5
cured my achor worm proble,5
"I am transitioning my three cats to this brand because my little dog does really well on their dog food.  I have a cat with a sensitive stomach who throws up once or twice a week.  He has not thrown up once in the past two weeks!  So far, I am very happy.  The cats really like it too.",5
"Our small dogs (Poms, Shiz Tsu) love the small tennis balls. They are just right for them to grab and play with but not too small to choke on.
They hold up fairly well and squeak for a long time...unless your dog sneaks them outside and leaves them in the rain for several days without you knowing. They also work in a cute toy a friend bought our dogs that throws the ball for them. I just need to train them to put the balls back IN the toy!",4
My corals go crazy for Reef-Roids! It does help to use the polyp booster along with it. But will work separately as well. Just be sure not to over do it.,5
"I bought this for my kitties -one of which is a ""plus size.""  He fits through it just fine but even with the 4-way locks all in the open position, the door sticks, and the cats haven't quited figured out that they need to use a little more effort to open it.  Therefore, I'm forced to keep it open, which is fine, since it's on an interior door.

The shipping was incredibly fast.  I ordered it on a Saturday and had it by the following Tuesday.",4
"My finches wouldn't eat it at all, so I went back to the Nyjer Thistle they love.  I've mixed this in with the regular bird seed for the other birds and they are eating it just fine, but I wouldn't recommend for the finches in my area.",3
"I just picked one of these up from my local pet store for my 7 month old border collie. Now my puppy is a bit of a chewer and it is really hard for us to find toys that will last for her. This particular toy only lasted about 10 minutes before she has broken the plastic pieces up. This item might work for smaller dogs, but if my 7 month old puppy ripped it apart in 10 minutes I would imagine than any larger dog would also make quick work of this toy.",1
"Finally a pair of clippers with a sharp blade! These make clipping effortless. My 90lb shelter dog used be absolutely terrified of nail trimmings and it'd take 3 techs to hold him down. With lots of training, I can now do it myself, it still isn't a walk in the park, but he's come a long way and he'll be there soon.",5
Love it. great training tool,5
Like the product itself but runs very small.,2
great,5
"The shape of the bowl has definitely forced our dog to slow his eating.  With a standard bowl, he could gobble his food in less than 10 seconds.  With this bowl, it takes him a good 3 minutes to get every last piece of food.  Unfortunately, it does seem like the coating on the bowl is coming off a little bit where his teeth hit the sides or where he licks a lot.",3
Works well have 2 in separate tanks easy to set up produces plenty of bubbles and of course CO2.,5
My baby loves this. It is good and sturdy so she cannot move it no matter how many times she runs through it. I do wish it was a little longer.,5
I ordered this door flap to replace the one which had worn out over several years of use. It fit perfectly and was not hard to install.,5
"I bought this toy because I (and my dog) are extremely happy with other JW Pet Company toys.  This one, however, isn't tough enough.  My lab had it ripped open and was chewing small rubber bits within 15 minutes.  I'd stick with the more solid rubber toys (see my other reviews) if you want something that will last.",2
"Ordered this for a 35-lb Aussie-Cocker mix as we headed for our first CPE Agility trial (where collars aren't allowed in the ring).  It's terrific - really easy to adjust to the right size, and to slip-on & slip-off very quickly (well...unless you're nervous during your first trial :-).  The adjustment stays in place thanks to secure & very well-made leather restrictor.  Good weight/circumference for our 35-lb dog but a little too big/thick for our 22-lb Mini Aussie.  (We got the 3/8"" version for him, and every bit as happy with that one.)",5
"Got a new litter box.
Fat cat missed, and peed on the side of the litter box which landed on this mat first use.
10/10 recommend. Easy to clean.",5
"Very Easy to use!  Smells so good!  I put on my dog's coat, rub it in, used a brush to Brush through and there was dirt that pulled off my dog's coat- awesome product....if even so my dog smells good...love it!",5
Not sure why there's Velcro but I like the leash in general.,4
This is fabulous just fabulous not like your every day cat litter rug. This really works omg I can't believe the difference. I bought two for both my kitty litter boxes. What a differents it makes. No cleaning up kitty litter all day. Thank you,5
Made the mistake of ordering this but not having the screen guard. I had to return it. The quality was good but the size did not allow my 90lbs Golden to get through. Return was hassle free though!,3
I use this to keep our dogs ears clean. Works good from what I can tell.,5
"My dog loves these, especially the gooberlicious (peanut butter flavor).  She goes crazy for these then when I tell her to sit she listens perfectly with her tail wagging.",5
Functional but very puffy and obtrusive. Usable but will not buy again.,3
"Had to return, could never get it to work consistently with associated Exo Terra Infrared light. Not sure which item was not working correctly since the switch of clamp lamp turned on. Not sure if this is indicative of quality or not, sometimes, things just fail.",2
Packs in a lot of hair and saves my fingers from having to pull it all out.,5
We have 5 dogs and 3 grand babies. The vet wrap works better for injuries on the kids then the Johnson & Johnson medical tape.,5
DOG LIKES IT,5
"All I can say is fantastic ball.
U won't regret buying it.",5
Our boy lives outside and he very quickly figured out that this mat was his new best friend!  He's very large with strong feet and it has held up all summer.,5
"Nice product. Really sturdy, you can actually stand/sit on it. My cat sits on this from time to time. She stratches the sides more often. I think it's really expensive given the purpose. Smaller rectangle cardboard scratchers are way more affordable and essentially serve the same purpose. However I expect this to last a long time.",4
My little 6lb chi fits nicely in it ... my only complaint is that the opening is too small its a little bit of a struggle to get her in it ... i kept it because i do like everything else about it,3
"bobo won't touch them, or any other dog treat.  people food for him only, how does he know?

 I watched my bro's dogs dig in his pocket for them. we fed all 3 dogs one and they gobbled them.. bobo ate his too.
now I see he just wanted what the other dogs were getting and swallowed before he realized.
you can really smell them, which I am sure they like.  my bro doles them out sparingly to his dogs and would never feed them anything other than highest quality petsmart type stuff, so these must pass.
I am giving these 5 stars after seeing how much 2 normal dogs love them.",5
My dog loves these treats!  I don't know if they clean his teeth but he loves them!,5
Great deal very pretty,5
"Good price, helps dog with bad breath. At least for a while after consuming. Better price, then purchasing at pets stores.",5
"I just LOVE At-a-glance planners!  They're so well made and durable, and the design is always so pretty, especially this one.  It has a very chic, simple and elegant look.  The cover is very nice, and it's durable, and it feels like it'll hold up extremely well through the coming year.

The inside has everything you need, from your calendar, to notes and contacts and other basic information.  It's so easy to utilize and fashionably functional, I think if you're looking for a good planner, you can't go wrong with this one, or any of the at-a-glance planner.  I've had several in the past, and I'm ALWAYS happy with them.  Plus, I think these make excellent gifts for the coming year!

Overall, I'd highly recommend this product.  I just love it, and I plan to purchase at-a-glance planners in the future for gifts and for myself.  No complaints, and I'm very happy with it!",5
I love this!  It works great and I can check on the health of my tank every time I run past it with just a glance.,5
Cat approved!,4
works fine... Cat uses it but not something we use everyday and probably wouldn't get again if it broke.,3
I use this regularly for Thunderstorms and Firework fear/anxiety issues and it works great!,5
"I had hoped these were the static cling stickers you simply place inside the window. These are sticky and are applied to the OUTSIDE of the window. Not wanting to have a ""sticker"" on my outside window, I found the static cling ones instead. The price is not bad so I will keep them as extras in case the static cling ones don't stay in place.",4
"Works great for minor bacterial issues and ich, but I've had no luck with fungal infections.  I've never had an issue with biological filtration when using this product.",5
Best fit!,5
I have 2 rats and I  bought this as an add-on to their tank they love it they crawl all over it sleep in it every night and seem to love the cage.,5
I actually use this to gutload my feeder insects. I have used it for years.,5
"Love this gentle leader! My dog fussed when I put it on her the first couple of times, but she walks so much better with this on. I wish I would have purchased this a lot sooner. I love how my dog can't go a certain direction unless I go and she doesn't pull anymore. Love this! I would most definitely recommend this if your pet has problems during your walks. It's a life-saver.",5
I was so disappointed my dog won't even eat it,1
"Light is on and off temp. Temp. Keeps fluctuating outside. As temp. Drops ill know if can keep tank heated consistently.  Calibrated properly. Happy for submergable components. Fingers crossed.
Shipped on time.",5
"Let me clarify by saying that I did NOT eat these. But they looked like a product my dog would love, so I bought them. The dog did not love them. She wouldn't even go near them. Very strong odor. Good size for little poochies or big hounds. Unfortunately, I've raised a picky-princess. If she acted like a normal dog, these would be fabulous!",4
"My dog loves them.  We got the large size even though we don't need that size.  Soft chewable and they must taste good since my dog has not found the pill yet, just snarphs them down.",5
"I accidently bought this instead of the Advantix ll and it did not work for the full month. My poor Chihauhau, my other dogs and myself were covered with bitting bugs undetectable to the eye during the 3rd week.
I have since changed over to the German developed product, SERESTO Collar
which lasts for 8 months making it much cheaper than the highly poisonous drops.
 Amazon has the best price and great reviews.  CHECK IT OUT and....... Follow your heart.",1
"If you want a shiny coat and supple fur on your dog this is it.  You will notice a difference within a week. And there are no side effects for my GSD or Sheltie (no diarrhea, vomiting, etc.).  They will be on this for life!  The skin is pink and perfect, no scratching or biting and the fur feels like it's been conditioned (not greasy just shiny and beautiful).  You and your pet will love this product!",5
"My ""rescue"" greyhounds are now 12+ years old. This seems to help them with their arthritis, allowing them to go up and down stairs.  The price is reasonable.  Some people state that this is an expensive ""placebo"", however, it isn't expensive and I'll take the chance that it may work ""somewhat"".  Some of the containers appear to be ""relabeled""...So be it.  The contents and ""expiry date are fine",5
I can't say that I notice a difference in my dog's teeth or breathe so far. She does seem to like it and it may take a while to see results but for now I'm still waiting. When she eats it I can smell it but there is no change in her mouth say 2 hours later. I will update later with any changes/results.,3
"I read the instructions and kept the unit plugged in for over 6 hours and it never warmed up.  I even tried my hair dryer in the electrical socket to make sure I didn't have an open circuit.  The hair dryer worked fine, but this Pet Bed Warmer didn't.  I had to return it because it would have never kept the animal warm.  I would not recommend this item, sorry K& H Pet Bed Warmer, I did try to follow the simple instructions but the unit that was sent to me didn't work.",1
They are very thin. My poodle takes less than a minute to go through bigger pieces. She just swallows smaller ones.,1
My dog pulls on the leash with any other type of harness or collar or there. The Easy Walk harnesses is like magic. He immediately walls well with no pulling. I was worried that this would not be sturdy but the material is not floppy at all. This was a replacement for his original Easy Walk that plain wow or after 8+ years. The black strap is helpful for that less familiar with it too know which stall goes under his front legs when putting it on.,5
My Bird Boris Loves It!!,5
"Weve added this to our dogs dry food every couple weeks or so for years, and they really enjoy it! Also seems to help and digestive/upset stomach issues.",5
Bought this at a pet store.....it was more expensive. ......but it's an awesome toy especially  if you roll it fast! (And bounce it)  Our dog played alot!,5
We have a super active 12 week springer spaniel who would take seconds to gobble her food up. this bowl has immensely helped. The size is ideal- the puppy eats slowly and not so difficult as to frustrate my puppy. Cleaning is easy too,5
"For the dog who shuns ""dog food"" (even the premium brands) in favor of table scraps, these whole-food granules encourage greater kibble consumption -- to a point; the table scraps, of course, are still preferred! But at least our little guy now obtains more balanced nutrition.",5
"I like to use this afte giving her a bath.  As the way the way it slides thru her hair, is just great to keep out mattin.",5
"My boxers love these but it takes me about ten minutes to load the treat into the ball and about two minutes for my male boxer to pop it out.  Once he has the treat out it only lasts a few minutes for him to crunch it up.  Very expensive for very little time.  ""Everlasting"" is very much a misnomer!",3
"We do a lot of rescue dog transports and adoption events.  This fits neatly in the back of the jeep and holds leashes, foldable water bowls, toys, food, treats, and other doggy items.  We keep it packed and ready to go.  A swipe with a damp cloth cleans off paw prints and dog hairs.",4
My Guinea pigs love it!,5
My dog chewed these up within minutes of taking them out of the package.,1
"Toothbrush has excellent bristles, think long and wide like adult OralB toothbrush and similar high quality construction.  The handle is good and has grippy feel but could be bit bigger in diameter.  I use these on my Yellow Labs and they work well and dogs seem to tolerate it without issue.  I have tried a lot of dog toothbrushes and currently 3/2017 these are the best going now.",4
"Can't use when not supervised. When I am with dog, he is supervised.  No use to me",1
"I am loving this fountain! With 6 cats and 3 dogs in the house I was worried. I have a reverse osmosis water systrm, so that is  what I use. My dogs and cats all drink from it. Which is extra important because two of the cats have urinary tract issues. They are fascinated  by the running water and drink  right from the stream.",5
"I have three rescue dogs, two of which lived ""rough"" before they were rescued, so I really try to keep their teeth healthy.  They each get one of these every night before bedtime and they look forward to this treat eagerly every night.  If I forget, they remind me.  I used to have their teeth professionally cleaned every year, but they have not needed it when they've had their recent annuals, so these things really work.",5
used this outside for a barrier...got steel rods to put in ground for the conectors so its more sturdy...would like to get more to have around a summer garden,5
"This is the second cave I've purchased.  Our wiener dog loved her first one so much that we added a second one for her crate.  We took the door off the crate and she runs to sleep in it now.  Because she loved hers so much, we ordered two of the extra large for our border collies and neither one would use it.  Sent them back.  So I guess it depends on the dog.",5
This stuff is awesome. Clumps like a rock and keeps the bathroom fresh from the 'smell'. Well worth the price!,5
"quite elegant,yes very much so, hmm.",5
"This product works great! My dog is a fence runner (& barker). She was running about just about everything. A spray of this with a strong NO stops her in her tracks. Peace at last. It's so nice to be in the yard with her now. Got a can for my sister, too, with the same results.",5
"Only took my 48lb boxer 1 hour to tear a gaping hole in the back of the rooster toy. The stitching failed between the leg and body and continued from there. So now we will continue the quest for the plush toy that lasts more than a day.

3 stars. She loved it, but it's not durable and it's a little expensive.",3
"Sizing was off, had to return.",1
These are fun with or without treats in them!  Our dogs love them!  The holes are a little large for putting kibble in them so we put a few larger treats like snasages with the kibble and that slows the dogs down a bit.  They like tossing the balls around and I like that they don't make much noise when played with.,5
Love these bags. Worth the price and this is not my first time buying this product. Will buy again!,5
"Let me preface this with this fact: I have a 1 year old pit bull mix. He destroys any toy -- yes, even Kong extremes -- very quickly. I tried doing all chew bones, but he seemed to lose interest in them quickly and try to steal socks to chew on them instead. Plus, he loves anything that squeaks. Well, I got him this toy as it has been recommended by several other pit bull owners. While he was absolutely enthralled with it, it met its untimely demise after about an hour. Which, admittedly, is pretty good for a soft toy. I would recommend it for someone who has a less determined dog. Still have yet to find the perfect squeaker toy for my baby!",4
"My 80-pound black lab-mix rescue dog is now 8 years old and not quite as active as she was as a puppy. Therefore, she requires less food each day than she consumed as an energetic youngster.

My dog loves solving this puzzle to eat part of her daily high-quality bison-based kibble! It takes her a while to remove each plastic cap and to eat the contents hidden beneath. Only after she has removed all four yellow caps can she spin the top and thus gain access to four more reservoirs of delicious kibble.

She seems much happier and more satisfied after eating food from this puzzle. She enjoys the mental stimulation. Better yet, her meal lasts much longer as a result of her problem-solving activity. Happy dog, happy me!",5
Cats love these and often chew on them. They are well built so I know they will last a long time.,5
Really thick so it is hard to spread.,3
"All the other over the counter flea meds are a joke compared to advantage. Frontline would not kill the fleas, but Advantage has saved my cat from flea torture. And Prime makes it so easy to get!!",5
"My Rottie had been quite a neglect case in his youth. Starved when found and 48 pounds underweight, we got him back in shape but were left a few years later with the fallout. Many years of dietary and physical neglect caused very early arthritis, dysplasia and ligament issues. Big dogs, big joints, big problems especially when they don't have the diet they need while being reared as pups. Well, he was achy and sad and miserable and unlike his otherwise happy, bouncy self. He started getting this and I noticed an effect within a few days, and within two weeks the old boy had quit moping on the stair landing and starting bolting around the backyard again. I wish they made this in a more tolerable form for people. Anyway, I'm 100% positive this product (recommended by my vet) kept him very comfortable for at least an added year. Also since it's soft like clay it's a great thing to hide other meds in if your dog like mine was on a multi-pronged therapy. No need for pill pockets, cheese or other ""hiding"" places for meds because these smell like beef bouillon and my dogs go nuts for them.",5
"We bought this collar on recommendation from our trainer because the first time we took our to a class with 6 other dogs she was nuts, just barking and pulling constantly. She basically had to stay away from the other dogs because she couldn't calm down and not be SUPER EXCITED. We now use it for all walks and training and she is practically a new dog with it on. She has learned that she gets treats for good behavior and she doesn't like the feeling of the pull when she does bad behavior. She has managed to calm down and be in the class and participate. I almost cried after the first class because she was so much better. She's not perfect, but that is where we come in as the human trainers!

She did NOT like it at first, pawed at it a lot, but we just started with short periods of time and worked our way up making sure to give her treats for all the good things she did with it on. OH! And my trainer mentioned to not have a heavy leash clip because then it bothers their nose and they will fight it. We got a thin light leash just for this collar. She doesn't really paw at it anymore! It has left an indent on her nose, but I am hoping to not have to use it for long periods in the future and hopefully it doesn't cause long term problems. Also, if your dog is crazy like mine is around other dogs or other distractions, keep them close and don't give them a huge range with it, makes a big difference when it comes to control.",5
"Great product, all you have to do is rinse them clean & they last a long time before having to replace them!! :-)",5
"We bought this after a friend had one for his dog.  I really like it as it's all contained in one place.  Lift the top, scoop the food in, get water in the bowl and the top is locked down so I don't need multiple places for food storage and then dog bowls.  Also it hold a 40lb bag of dog food.  So it has ample space.",5
Good clickers.  Convenient wrist strap.,5
"For the first time, I was able to put up a Christmas tree and not have my cats destroy it.  Worked brilliantly.  I used three mats around my 7 foot tree.  I put them on top of my tree skirt, kind of out at the edge so you can see most of the tree skirt.",5
This is my daughters little dogs favorite thing in the whole world.  They fit right in his little mouth and he loves the squeak!,5
"Great product, love the extra length!",5
I do cat rescue and this is a wonderful holding pen for the kittens and older cats.  It gives them more freedom than a crate and it is very sturdy and well made.  My cats have tried to get out and it has held iup.  Great buy.,5
Bought this for a friend and her cat is drinking water indoors again. Read instructions carefully if you don't get water flow - you did it wrong.,5
Tends to crack the nails rather than cut cleanly,3
It works as advertised and is natural versus drugs that don't feel are good for the dog.,4
"So happy I have these now. Let's start with the fact they are inexpensive! They have Safety stop! The nail trimmers are sharp so they cut without exfoliating the nails. I wrapped my kitty in a sheet to demobilize her, was petting and talking to her while cutting her nails. She ended up purring and asking to pet her more. I think she liked her nails trimmed :)",5
Works like a charm. This makes maintaining my aquarium SO much easier.,5
"This is not an X-Large size harness.. It fits a medium dog- I gave it to a friend and it fit her Springer !  I have a Doberman and it was at least 5"" too small.. not worth the $$ to return it",1
I love it and my cats say they love it too!!! Great buy!!,5
"This shampoo makes my dog more flaky and itch. I am a certified groomer and I diluted this shampoo as usual. I bathed my dog with this shampoo almost a month now, and the result is very bad. More dandroff, more dryness, more itchness. I don't recommend this shampoo for eczma dogs.",1
Not all my dogs are smart enough to get in them by themselves (i have to hold them open) but they stay in there all night.  If they get hot they have no problems getting themselves out and laying on top.  I have 70 lb pitbulls. I got them both a large (each).,5
"I'm not sure if my fish like it.  I followed all the directions, but most of the fish avoided the treated food.  The few that did eat the treated food gobbled it as fast as they could and seemed to want more.  I am a faithful purchaser of Seachem products and will not let this experience stop me from being a faithful customer.",3
"I have two longhaired cats who will NOT swallow that malt-flavored hairball ointment that is such a common remedy. It doesn't matter how I present it, it's a ""No!""

So the first great thing about these is that my cats -both of them- will eat them! The second great thing is the ingredients--very natural and healthful, as are the promised benefits to coat and digestion. It is difficult to know if they are preventing hairballs (because they are indoor-outdoor cats), but I think this product can only be good for them. I got these initially through Vine, but plan to continue getting them. I think it's a really good idea and a very good product.",5
"it works! I cant believe it....Ive been using Frontline and advantage which DONT WORK AT ALL

IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT",5
I've been using this on our mini poodle since he was 6 weeks old. He loves taking a bath and i groom him myself haircut and all. He even loves it when i spray it on him. Have given to friends whose furbabies  didn't smell that sweet. They love it too.,5
"My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.

One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.

I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.

My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.

It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.",3
"These Denta Clean Sugar Free breath mints for dogs really work! I've bought quite a few products trying to keep my dog's breath fresh, but nothing else is effective except these breath mints, so when the supply starts getting low, I order again. The best thing about this product is its healthy ingredients, containing no sugar or artificial sweetner. She loves them. I still brush her teeth nearly every day because I homecook her food, and dogs that don't eat dry kibble need regular toothbrushing. But the breath mints are good for between brushings. I highly recommend them.",5
Seemed to work a little for a short while. Then nothing. Now trying a different kind for my girl that has spay incontinence.,3
It's a standard Kong -- what is there not to like!,5
These don't really stick to anything except themselves. Have to say I am using them with the white paper on them - when I try to pull that paper off they pull off the furniture and I try to put them back on and they will come off in a few seconds.  These are NOT thick enough to stay on and not sticky enough to stay on.,1
These fit very well & our dogs really wear them well. They wash nicely & are easy on & off. Very high quality!,5
RETURNED,1
The product is recommended by our much respected veterinarian ... and came to us via your service on time.  I was able to apply my Discover points to bring the cost down.  What's not to love?  THANKS!,5
This works great on a lot of skin issues.,5
We got one of these for our rescue pitbull because she would practically inhale dinner in one gulp.  This now slows her down to a more normal speed.  Just be careful if you are using any liquid as the bowl part of this is extremely shallow.  The trouble is that we had to buy a second on of these because our other dog thought he was getting short rations because he was finishing eating earlier than the pitbull,4
works great!!,4
great product,5
"This is the second one purchased after the first one was played with so much that a new one was required.
It is one of her favorite tos.",5
"These are excellent treats to use for dog training, as they are small enough to keep a handful in your pocket or in a treat pouch for easy rewarding.  They are soft and quickly and easily swallowed by your dog, so that you're not waiting for them to chew something up before you can continue your training.  We have a large dog, so she doesn't get ""filled up"" during training sessions, but of course you would have to limit the number with a smaller dog.  We also like the fact that they are a healthier treat, free of wheat, corn and soy, and available in a few different flavors.",5
"I bought this after my old fabric bag dispenser (came free with a box of bags) fell apart.  I've been using it for a few days now and I heartily recommend it.  This thing is so much better than the cheapie dispensers.  It has two velcro attachment points so it doesn't rattle or slide around on the leash, and the hole for dispensing the bags is just the right size - not so big that the roll falls out, not so small that it's hard to pull out the next bag.  The second pocket is a little too small to hold a credit card or ID when there's a full roll of bags, but it will hold a couple of keys, treats, cash.  It's especially great for warm days when I don't have any jacket pockets.  We use it with a rope-style leash, but it would work with a normal flat leash too.",5
"My 180lb Newfoundland has been know to pull if he gets excited or just wants to go. His previous harness was well made but wasn't designed like this harness and didn't provide help in stopping his big movement. After reading a user review who had a St. Bernard that the harness worked so well on, I ordered this very affordable product. The harness was easy to adjust on my big boy and despite his very large size it fits him very well. The real test was a visit to the vets and to my amazement, I could easily control him. I also have a 100lb Great Pyrenees Border Collie cross and her harness worked exactly the same. A superb product to aid in handling our best friends! Highly recommended.",5
"It wasn't too bad, but not as good as some other products i have tried.  It has no citronella scent to it, but didn't remove odor for the long term.",3
Great water treatment and quite economical!,5
"So far, doing exactly as described. Our mini pin eats so fast that she goes around eating the other dogs food and then gains a ton of weight. She has been on a diet and has done well, but needed to slow down her eating and this bowl significantly extends her meal time. I highly recommend for small dogs who eat way too fast.",5
It does not come packaged like it appears in picture. It comes on cardboard and falls apart pretty easily.,2
"My dogs love a lot but getting too expencive day by day.
Its so bad i cant find this in the stores.",5
These are well made and durable and they fold flat.  I have this sitting on top of my dog's crate.  It's so handy -- can just pick up her toys and toss them in.  If they made these in more dark solid colors I would probably buy more.,4
"This crate is working out perfectly for us. I did put a nice fluffy bed, the exact size in the bottom. I had purchased a larger medium, as I had not seen the dog we were adopting, until she came on her journey from Tennessee to NJ. Her size was a bit of surprise, as she was taller then I expected. I worried that the crate would be too small, but it was perfect.
I could not have asked for a better dog, crate trained, house trained, friendly, to adults, children, dogs + cats..Did I mention how lovable she is. Rosie was also trained To go in her crate, by saying ""Go to Bed Rosie"""".
Perfect crate, very pleased with it.",5
"I cannot say enough great things about this product.

After several weeks of fighting with my cat who did NOT like me putting hairball gel on her paws (most of which ended up on my carpet or me...), this product saved both my cat and myself from aggravation.

More importantly IT WORKS!!!  And my cat who's a finicky eater LOVES the flavor.  12pcs every morning and she hasn't thrown up once!  I highly recommend this product.",5
Exactly what I needed for my dog. He is a Brittany Spaniel and weighs 35 pounds. He pulls a lot of walks (and still does). I mainly got this because we were concerned that he was hurting himself (his neck) - this puts the strains on his chest and we no longer have to worry about him crushing his throat on walks.,5
"This thing definitely did the trick for keeping my cats off the kitchen table when it was up there.  It works well when detecting motion...even in the dark, which would scare the s**t out of me when I would walk by and forget that it was on!",5
"High quality food.  They have great dietitians on staff when I call and have been very helpful over the year.  I have used Nutro since the 90's.  I have never been disappointed.  One time I was having problems with a cat, and they suggested another brand.  I will always go back to them!",5
"fits good, the dog hates it",4
Have a pack of 15 dogs and there's not one that doesn't live this toy. They line up like Chistmas when the box comes! Last months with most of them and I have some aggressive chewers.,5
"Didn't work for my dog. But his anxiety is very severe, and I wasn't expecting much. I have worked in a vet industry for a while now, and we always recommend it for clients who have dogs with anxiety. A lot of customers rave about it. There's no way to know if it'll work for your dog or not without trying it, so I definitely recommend trying it. Also pay attention to the replace date. It's only effective for so long - so pay attention to when to replace",2
"We have two rescue turtles.  Our vet recommended this products as a TREAT for our turtles.  They do love it.  When given a choice of this or other foods, they choose this first.  You can't go wrong with this - one of our turtles when first rescued had to be force fed by the vet for regular food (shrimp, etc) but was very willing to eat these treats.  We highly recommend them as a TREAT.  This is not a basic food so make sure that your turtles have a well balanced meal.  But do include these, because they apparently are quite desired.",5
"I bought 2, 1 for my Cane Corse and 1 for my Shar-Pei. They are clumsy built and I have replaced them.",2
"I've tried just about everything.... This IS the best stuff out on the market! My dog has a ton of leg/joint issues and this is the only product that she's taken that I've noticed a difference in a matter of weeks. It is a little pricy compared to other glucosomine supplements, but if you can afford it it's worth it. She also doesn't mind the taste of them, which is always a plus!",5
Delivered as promised; excellent product.  Try smaller package next time!,4
Much better than the other all natural litters we have used.,5
"I only purchased this online because I was having difficulty finding a Black one at the local pet stores. Despite my effort, I was sent a Silver one. It works, but it's completely off the color theme of my entire living room. I will definitely be getting a diddle rent one when my fish grow out of it. Other than that, it arrived in one piece and serves it's purpose.",4
"I have two young dogs (1 year) and they like to chew, chew, chew (on anything and everything).  I have spent a fortune trying to keep them chewing on the right things.  Most of the bones that are edible are gone in a flash.  The too hard ones, they won't touch.  These are perfect and keep them busy for a while.  I finally found something that will allow me a little peace once in a while (from chasing my dogs because they have something in their mouth they shouldn't be chewing).  Yeah!",5
The individual packets are nicely designed and the carbon seems to be of high quality.  I would recommend these for your Fluval.,5
"This is most definitely for a cat. If you are on the fence about what size your dog needs, it's probably not this. My guy is 13lbs and he had a hard time with visibility in the size small collar, but eventually we figured out that we could just remove the top half of the boning from the collar and bend it back. It worked much better after that. I wish the company made something between the XS and the S because it's a really big jump.",2
Lock nice,5
"dig didn't like at first,  learned to chew it,  likes chicken,  hates beef one",3
"It looked exactly as pictured when it arrived. Nice vibrant colors, good padding on the back area. Noticed some white color at the bottom but didn't think anything about it other then it was part of all the colors. Placed my dog in it and within less then an hour, the stitching at the bottom began to come apart. I realized it was the white showing through when I first opened the package. Sewed it back together and it has been fine.",2
"Well made, excellent value. Solid construction.",5
diffuses the co2 into really small bubbles. would buy again,5
Surprisingly still has one of the squeakers.,5
Good product for small critters,5
"All four of our cats like this litter box.  The youngest, still a kitten, immediately started to play in it because it dwarfs her small size.  We got it in the hopes that our huge calico would find it easier to find a spot inside the pan to relieve herself rather than going right on the outside edge of the pan and making a mess.  So far, so good.  I like that you can see inside the pan through the clear lid.  I wish they were a little less expensive.  We already invested in two more.",5
"Great product!! They really work! I have seen a difference since, my dog has been taking them.",5
"Great product. You can definitely hear it when it kicks in, but won't hear it as it runs. Very solid overal. -30 gallon reef tank-",4
MY SON LOVES IT FOR HIS DOG.,5
"works great and does not irritate the dogs nose, stays put.",5
Too heavy for tousing around in door.  Heavy and hard...,4
"Cute item, but very bulky and warm. We live in Florida, so I returned it since I felt like carrying a huge pillow around.
The item is a good quality and looks very nice otherwise. If you live in colder climates, go for it!",4
too small,1
Too big for a medium size dog even after adjusting the buckels...,2
"bought for dog's allergy symptoms of cracked feet, used briefly because got on different regimen to combat allergies, but nice product",4
"These work great, but the rubber edge does pull away from the bowl after a few uses and needs to be repositioned.",4
"My parkeets love thses cuttle bones. They are long lasting
and easy to install in any cage. Its a bargin to buy two.",5
My dog absolutely adores thse,5
"Love this bowls they do not sleep, are easy to clean and just perfect!",5
"Larger individual product than purchased from other companies. Dry, not greasy. Talons removed! Too few in the package to last with big dogs. Good for a special treat.",4
My bunny absolutely loves these treats. Because she tends to snatch treats away quickly I typically give these if I have a guest that wants to feed the bunny. Unfortunately there are not many treats in the bag.,4
Great product! Exactly what I expect.  Thank you!,5
My parrot had lots of fun destroying this toy - he constantly talks and fights with it...Make sure to soak in cold water to get rid of the excess dye before giving to your parrot,5
"My dog loves hit Chew Rope Toy, I'm glad I bought this.",5
Perfect for the kitties,5
"Never fluffed up, remained flat, my dog hates it",1
Our hamster gobbled these up. Nice little chew stick.,5
My puppy loves this food. She doesn't even let me get it into her bowl before she digs in. Not even sure she chews.,5
"I give my dogs one a day. They love them, they never get an upset tummy, and they're not fat.",5
"my dog loves these vits, they are the only ones sge will eat,,good thing she don't know there good her hermmmmor she would stop eating them",5
Great quality and price compared to other leading wild salmon oils out there. It's a great supplement to add to your dog's food daily for overall health and a great looking fur.,5
"Got this for our lab.  Lasted, literally one night.  Broke open with just a few hours of our dog moving around (normal use, nothing crazy, no water, bad weather etc).

Literally split apart on us after 4 hours.  Total waste of our money. Do not buy this.",1
This product doesn't work. I have sprayed it on my couch twice and within minutes my cats are sitting happily on the couch.,1
"This collar is nice and soft yet strong, I really like it. I always used chain chokers but I like this one better. We have 6 months old very energetic lab and this collar makes walking / training her easier, I definitely recommend it.",5
"Great item, well worth the money and easy to clean up.",5
"Limited Ingredient Diets blend is the grain-free diet. If my money can go to something made in the USA and my dog scarfs it down you know I will pay a couple extra dollars. The final report comes from our 15 year old, ten pound, miniature fox terrier - she loves it.

"Would buy again !
Worked great for baby chicks.",5
He loves it!!,5
My cats love this food.  I am pleased to be able to offer them something good tasting and nutritious.,5
"Theses do a great job and we used them often. The material is durable, it fits easily in the fountain.",5
The best dog brush EVER! I have two dogs who shed year-round and I have been using a Furminator brush for over a year. Neither of my dogs liked the Furminator brush but they love the Kong ZoomGroom - it is very gentle. The ZoomGroom is as if not more effective than pricier brushes and my dogs now enjoy being brushed.,5
"It is fun and hilarious to watch my dogs play with this puzzle. This is very different than the other ones I own by Nina Ottosson, so they have not yet completely solved it. It keeps them mentally engaged for quite some time, and it is very durable, so no matter how much they abuse it, it stands up to their antics. I just love watching them try to get all the treats out!",5
The dogs loved it but I have two big labs so it did not last long. I had to go with something more economical.,4
The BEST Potty pads!!!,5
I got a very good price ($6.50) on this shampoo. Works great on my cats and leaves him smelling very good. Would recommend to anyone who can bath their cat.,5
"I bought this ""Super Pet Woodland Get-A-Way"" rabbit house for three of our male guinea pigs who are in one huge cage, but five minutes after I put it into their cage, I realized that was a mistake. All three of them starting chewing on the wood, and I saw rapidly that we would be hearing that non-stop.

I then put it into their dad's cage, and HE loved it! He rarely chews on it, and it has become his ""comfort zone"". It is so cute to see him stick his head out of the side hole, to see if a treat is coming. Once he is sure that something is coming his way, he dashes out the door, grabs a piece of the ""offering"", and backs up into the house.

Excellent purchase, and would get another for his three offspring, but couldn't stand the noise they would generate...",5
My Betta is happy and healthy! I've been using this for over a year now.,5
Piggies won't eat it.,2
Beautifully made and perfect size for taking our bunnies to the vet.  This would also work great for a small dog under 15 lbs.,5
"This thing is a gas.  Throw a jacket over it and smuggle your friend into almost anywhere.  I had to take a black marker and color in the paw print on the front ; )  JackJack D'Jack gives it a double ""no thumbs"" up!  We call it his ""Jack Pack,"" and as long as he's sporting his citronella bark collar we are virtually undetectable!  I don't normally roll it with him inside as it pitches a bit awkwardly and is pretty bumpy, but it is a nice feature to have. I have taken him through the grocery store inside, then put the groceries inside and rolled it along walking him. It is less embarrassing and easier to handle than an old lady basket, AND I can pop it on my back too.  My friend even used it as a spare baggage on the airplane when she got nailed for her too-big carry on.",5
i think they should either give you 3 more for the price or quit making a fountain the cost so much too keep your cats or dogs happy with fresh cold water.,3
These lights really make my tank pop. They are bright cool white light.,5
"These are great for my lab/mastiff mix. He destroys everything he's given.  Fortunately, these keep him busy for a couple hours.",5
Excellent product!,5
great,5
"Cats love this stuff.  My Fancy Feast cat is now 14 yrs old.  He is beginning to have kidney issues and the vet wanted him exclusively on a prescription diet.  He wasn't having any of the prescription diet (loving his Fancy Feast) so I ended-up mixing it half-n-half.  Perhaps this wasn't an ideal solution, but the good news is he would at least get some prescription food.  It has worked because last blood work showed a better kidney function and vet was pleased.  My cat has always loved his Fancy Feast preferring the ""Classic"" variety over the grilled or shredded stuff.",5
Works good but cat not interested. Lol,5
Terrible product. So much noise my dogs hate it. Don't buy is scary for dogs.,1
"Dogs love these things, especially if you jam a treat inside. Not indestructible, but a good diversion while they last.",4
Was quite a bit smaller than the measurements given in the description. Didn't fit my dog and had to send it back.,2
"This is our third one of these - I love them.  We have one for dog food, cat food, and kitty litter.  They aren't the most reasonably priced containers but they are the best I have found by far and I think everyone with a pet should have these!",5
"Great cat tree, easy to put together.",5
Love it!,5
"Very pleased with my dogs new tag.  My previous tags had worn down, and his name and my contact info were no longer visible.  This new tag lettering looks clearer than any of my old tags.  It looks like it will last a long time.",5
worked like a charm. until my dog thought it was a giant novelty chew toy,4
"They love using it and it's very easy to clean.  I did remove that flap though, they hate that part.",5
"Want to cycle your tank really fast? Get a bottle of your favorite nitrifying bacteria, get this ammonium chloride, add a dose and watch your bacteria go to town! I did a fishless cycle with BIO-Spira bacteria  and I did a high dose of this ammonium chloride and they devoured all the ammonia up in less than 3 days. Did 2 more smaller doses  and my tank was ready. Will be using this stuff for every new tank I setup.",5
One of my cats that doesn't usually play with toys had a blast with these.,5
"Cute toy, but my dog (1 year old golden retriever) destroyed it in a matter of hours.  He removed the eyes and the green patch within 10 minutes.  He loved it while it lasted though!",3
"Since adopting my two puppies it took me a while to settle on a food for them.  I tried Blue Buffalo which they seemed okay with but didn't love, I tried Science Diet healthy puppy (which I get at a huge discount from the vet clinic I work for) but they didn't like it and it made them gassy. I tried small bags of Chef Micheals and Rachel Ray - both of which they loved to eat, but were a little lower in nutrition than I wanted to give them.  The younger of my puppies was adopted with a large stab wound on his side which triggered a case of demodex.  Working at a clinic I know that dogs with skin issues generally benefit from a fish based food as the omegas and fish oil are very good for skin and coats.  My mom, who also has two new puppies and I were discussing foods and this option came up.  We each ordered a bag - she went with the Buffalo version<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taste-of-the-Wild-Grain-Free-High-Prairie-Dry-Dog-Food-for-Puppy-30-Pound-Bag/dp/B006BU77F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taste of the Wild Grain-Free High Prairie Dry Dog Food for Puppy, 30-Pound Bag</a>.  I chose the pacific stream because the base is Alaskan salmon.  I like the grain free aspect because with my two rescues, who knows what type of allergies they have... it also has probiotics which we recommend for puppies as well. They aren't as good as the probiotics in Royal Canin but they are better than nothing, it helps to keep little tummies from being upset.  The ingredients are excellent and the price for the food is very reasonable for what is in the food.

I'm on bag number 5, and both puppies have grown sleek healthy coats, they have healthy skin and apart from a little gas from one of them - we have minimal stools with minimal odor.

Yes I know that the true manufacturer of this food is Diamond - I also know that several dog foods have been recalled over the years, not just Diamond's.  It is a chance that I take whenever I buy any food for my dogs or myself.  Since the last large recall, I believe that government oversight and testing have increased for all dog food manufacturers.

Until they are off of puppy food - I will continue feeding this to my two puppies.",4
"Purchased this for my small 1.5 gallon tank for my betta.  Was going to return since it was too powerful and too much current for my betta, and kept him hiding in his rock, but based on another review, and suggestion (thank you Amanda) I went ahead and purchased the additional foam filters and placed one on the outgoing spout.  It worked!!! now i have on and my betta is happily hanging around. I also placed carbon pellets in a stocking and placed under the inside filter, as recommended.  All is good.  I also like it much better than the Tetra Whisper for small tanks as this one does not use an air pump and the is MUCH more quiet.",4
It works fine but it also makes a very audible clicking noise when it turns on and off and my god that is annoying when your tank is located next to your couch. I should have read more reviews and went with a different model.,3
Good but poor quality,3
As advertised 100%,4
As described. We use them to train a 7 month old lab. She loves them.,5
"I just ordered my second one of these toys.  I own two adult Rottweilers.  I stuff the body with squeeking tennis balls.  They love playing tug with it.  The first Nylabone tug toy lasted six months with only the loss of the monkey's head.  My Rotts have never liked toys with eyes, the first thing to be eaten off are the eyes.  But then they don't like to be stared at either.  They have not been able to tear the tails off no matter how hard they pull one another acoss the living room rug.  This is as close as I have found to a Rottweiler proof toy.  The only other toy that is Rottie proof is the indistructable ball.",5
"This cat tree is a great buy. My 2 cats love it. They pretty much alternate what levels they want to sleep on daily (hey, variety is the spice of life!). Right now, as i write this, one is sleeping on the top most level and the other is sleeping in the ""house"" on the 1st level.
The toys are fun and I have had no problems with them falling off or disintegrating.
The tree was easy to put together and came with all tools needed. It took me about 30 min. to put together.
I have it in a corner and it seems quite sturdy.
Very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommended for multi-cat households.",5
Jake loves them.,5
"You DO have to sift by shaking, unlike what I read but still does well.  I do like a long handle scooper better though.",4
pink cat tower. enough said.,5
"I bought this as an ""add on."" to other purchases. The price was about 1/2 of what I normally pay at Petco.  I've been using these balls for years, but tired of my dog losing them and the high price (it all adds up.) This was a good deal, so I'm happy. I bought 4, less than a month later I'm down to 3. My current herding breeds sure can't find balls in bushes like a lab....",5
Fits my 12 lb min pin perfect. She looks so cute!!,5
didn't work!,1
"This worked ok, but didn't solve the bad gas problem.",3
Quality bags and large enough to pick up after my two large dogs. Buying the bags like this sure beats the price from the pet stores.,5
Great light for my aquarium. Love it.,5
"My 3 cats love this toy but needed to purchase replacement pieces (feathered ends) but reviews said they are garbage, would be 5 stars if it made higher quality replacment ends.",4
One can can feed both my cats but my picky ragdoll doesn't like this at all. Even my shorthair cat who eats literally everything doesn't really like this. They used to be crazy about can food because I feed them fancy feast cans. I guess they're disappointed after trying this. I'm not going to feed them this again after they finish the whole pack.,4
"My dogs loved this product. I used it to flavor their kibble. The package is small and the price is too high. If price is not a concern, then I recommend it. Otherwise it's too pricey.",4
"I had begun to learn more about cat nutrition when my old girl started failing.  I weaned her off dry food and the canned store brands which I learned are pure crap and onto the really good brands (Wellness core, Merrick BG, etc.) and it prolonged her life. She passed last year and now, I'm searching for decent quality canned food that won't break the bank for the rest of my pack. I've found this food, Trader Joe's and Nature's Balance.  With this one, I really like that the first five ingredients are meats followed by chicken broth.  Whole brown rice, whole white rice, oatmeal, potatoes and barley are next which really doesn't thrill me.  Cats don't need and shouldn't have many carbs, but it's an evil compromise that keep costs down.  I was very pleased that this does NOT contain Carrageenan.  The cats seemed to like it so far. I don't pretend that this is the best of the choices out there, but it's a huge step up from the store brands.
Word of advice...if you haven't already, learn how to read the ingredient labels and what they mean.  ""By products"" and ""meal"" should never be the first ingredients (or at all) in canned food, and stay away from anything containing ""animal fats"".",4
My dog won't go near this. Even if I spray it on my fingers or a cookie (trying to get her used to the taste so I can spray it on her teeth),2
My cat loves this toy. The colorful material twirling around quickly attracted my cat's attention and she'll play withit as long as someone is moving it,5
Dog loves them,5
This has been a miracle supplement for my two pugs! Even my vet told me he had never seen such healthy skin and beautiful coats!,5
"They're good, but my dogs go thru them super fast cause they're heavy chewers",4
Excellent service!  They are great for catching litter off their paws!,5
my cats love it,5
nice clipper,5
Our sweet miniature Schnauzer loves her new memory foam bed!  She has had knee surgery on both her hind legs and is quite fragile.  She happily steps right up on her bed and sleeps there every chance she gets!  She is happy and so we are too!,5
"Our cats love this. And I am happy that they are eating good, healthy food.",5
I've had this over a year now and it has held up nicely. Keeps my dog from climbing into the front seat. Also keeps her from falling into to floor during sudden stops.,5
"This fit my pooch perfectly! I used the measurements that were provided, and it was accurate. It seems a lot more comfortable than the last harness I had for my dog. It also seems to make her pull less when we're going for a walk. It's also really easy to put on her!",5
This filter/waterfall is beautiful and keeps the water clean!,5
Cats are addicted. They know the sound of it opening rooms away.,5
Fresh breath,5
The chews were terrific. The dog enjoys them a lot. She can not wait to get them as a treat. It must be time to get more.,5
My dogs weren't crazy for these. The outer crust crumbles and breaks off. The bully stick inside really has a strong odor and my husband has to flee the room. They were advertised to not have an odor I thought.  The price is good but not a winner in this house.,4
"It's new, so the birds are giving it a wide berth right now.  But they have seen ladders before, and have used them, so I know that eventually when they are accustomed to it being there, they will be up and down it all the time.  It's very sturdy, and attaches easily to the cage or a perch.",5
"I have been feeding this to my 4 dogs for about two years now. They all love it. It's a great food that's actually good for your dogs at a good price. I also like that they have multiple flavors (that are all good for them) so that my dogs can get some variety. One of my dogs always just knows when the box for this food arrives at our house and tries to open up the box before I do! I would - and have - recommend this food to anyone that's looking for a food that's actually good for their dogs, but at a price that isn't outrageous. I have gotten all of my family members with dogs to start using this brand.",5
My dog enjoys th.,5
Never had one dog turn them down and who would know better than a dog. (I'm not trying them). Good ingredients and as a person who cares what I give my dog I find this treat to be right on top of my list.,5
"If you want to maintain insectivore birds, this is your choice.  It is a pleasure to watch them pickup and hide the peanuts, and it keeps lovely birdsong in your yard.",5
"works good, makes pulling the dog in the boat much easier on me and her.  and it doesnt affect her swimming any.",5
"If you are like me (I assume you are since you're looking at this product), and would like something to clean your aquarium's walls you have found the right product! I have used a few different aquarium scrapers/cleaners and so far this is the best one.

What makes this different from the cheap magnetic aquarium cleaners is that the cleaning side isn't just a piece of felt that is going to get gunked up and start rotting while in your tank. This is like the rough side of velcro on the cleaning side, and softer on the side that you grab a hold of. If you move it too quick, or get carried away and lift the outer side off the glass, then you don't have to go deep sea diving for the scrubber side on the bottom of your tank! It just floats on the top, waiting for you to save it's life. If you're quick enough with the outer magnetic side, you can sometimes get the scrubbing side back on the side before it floats to the top.

Now for the bad side.. You may be asking, how can there be a bad side if I rated it 5-stars? Here it is: I didn't buy a big enough one. I have this on a 46-gallon bow front (thin enough glass) that it works wonderfully. When I tried to use it on my 75-gallon Oceanic tank, not so much. The glass is a lot thicker on the bigger tank, and the magnets weren't strong enough for that.

I would highly recommend the small to those with a tank smaller than 40 gallons, if you have a little larger tank I would recommend the medium, and anything 75+ gallons, I would recommend the large just so the magnets are strong enough that it doesn't lose it's connection on the thicker glass.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask in the comments and I usually respond within a day.",5
"This thing is AMAZING. Seriously life changing. We have a 90 lb Lab who had major joint surgery and was put on severely limited activity for many months. Consequently, when we got the vet's okay to start leash walks, our dog was so excited and enthusiastic that he was a nightmare to walk. He completely pulled me off my feet more times than I'd care to admit, and if we came across another dog or person - forget about it. He'd pull so hard he'd choke himself and he would lunge at people and scare them (not being agressive, just wanted to meet them - but it'd still scare them to have a huge dog running towards them with me barely hanging on), and I was seriously starting to worry about dislocating a shoulder or elbow because he would pull so hard. Walks were completely miserable. In desperation I tried the Gentle Leader....and omg. The very first time we tried it I saw a 100 percent improvement. I thought for sure it was just a fluke, but low and behold we've been using it twice a day for a month now and the difference is AMAZING. Walks are actually pleasant now (for both of us). I can literally hold on to the leash with two fingers for our enitre walk. He doesn't lunge anymore and the pulling is nonexistant. Keeping him from ""meeting"" other people and dogs is a cinch. If he starts to pull I just give the leash a quick little tug and he stops. I could kiss the feet of the person who invented this. If you're going to buy this product, make sure you watch the DVD that comes with it - it's very helpful for learning how to fit the collar and how to use it.

I did remove one star because after a month of twice-daily use the fur on the top of his nose is starting to rub off a little bit. But it's not bad and doesn't seem to bother him. I've been recommending this to everyone who stands still long enough to listen and would buy it again in a heartbeat.",4
Good price on a good product.,5
"I have two female cats, who will both (they're sisters) be 16 years old in the summer of 2016. They developed CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) in the past 5 years and I learned at that time (unfortunately) that the dry food I had fed for years was not good for them (corn, other grains, fish who have been exposed to harsh chemicals in the Asian seas, garbage food, etc.) and I needed to feed them a wet food, not only because it's more nutritious (some of it), but because they need more fluids.

I had read somewhere that people were feeding this to their cats because it's low in phosphorus (phosphorus is bad for CKD), so I bought some. My cats loved it, other than the beef... they don't care too much for that one.  After researching though, I've been unable to find any data that shows that this is, in fact, low in phosphorus and better for cats with CKD. Phosphorous can damage the kidneys when present in excess quantities. Consumers have been misled to believe that high protein content is the issue, but a raw diet consisting of large amounts of quality protein can help maintain muscle mass and is very palatable.  I searched Tanya's Comprehensive Guide To Feline Chronic Kidney Disease for this Fancy Feast on her food chart and it shows it has a higher amount of phosphorus than the more expensive food that they were eating before. The prices on the expensive brands are killing me and the cats waste so much of it. It's unbelievable how the 'prescription' pet food companies are taking advantage of consumers, charging as much as human food (as much as $24 for an 8 lb bag of food) and still adding toxic ingredients. I thought I'd try going with a cheaper food, not only because the food is breaking my budget, but because my cats will go all day without eating when I put out a food they don't like. It's better that they're eating something, than nothing. But, seeing that I'm probably doing more damage with this food, I've ordered something else that I'll try for the CKD that's not as expensive as the Solid Gold brands or the Neo Feline Formula which they loved the first week, now they hate it. I did find some Hill's Science Diet Adult Minced Gourmet Turkey for $25.70 (case) for CKD. It costs more, but it's almost twice the can size. Hopefully, they will eat it. I'll save the FF as a backup or to mix into the top of foods they don't like so they'll eat it.",3
Very pretty.,5
"I have to watch the price, but when the price is competitive with my local pet suppliers, I'll get this through Amazon.  It comes fresh and lands on my porch, which reduces the steps I take hauling the big bag from the shelves to the cashier to my car to my porch to my dog food bin.

My vet approves of this for my dogs and the dogs seem to enjoy it.  We supplement with a few treats here and there, like Milk Bone biscuits.  Their coats are soft and shiny, with no skin problems.  For years, we used ""budget-friendly"" grocery store type of dog food and wondered why our dogs would have poor skin conditions (I personally think it was all the corn and corn derivatives used in some dog kibble).  Since we stepped up on what we feed our most loyal companions, we've seen a good healthy glow to their skin and coats.",5
Great treat. Only one of my two cats like it.,4
"MY cat has tooth resorption, and so his mouth is constantly red and sore. Petzlife gel was recommended to me by a vet many years ago and we have been using it ever since. We like the peppermint, it makes his breath a little nicer. I am convinced that this product had kept his problem minimal and that hopefully we won't have to have his teeth pulled, which is the normal outcome. I also use it on our dog once a week or so, to supplement her regular brushing with toothpaste. GREAT PRODUCT! TRY IT!",5
"soft, cute and really easy to use. Just make sure your dog will fit in there",5
Dog loves it,5
as advertised,5
Charli really eats this product. It is one of her big favorites. I buy it all the time for her.,5
"I have a beagle boxer pit mix and considered a medium size dog. Due to her breed mix i have to go up a size for sweaters and whatnot. However, I ordered a 3xl after reading reviews that they ran small and it was still much too small for her. The length was perfect, but everything else was too small to fit.",1
"Easy to use; works as described. The only problem I have is trying to hide it from my dog. He always seems to know when I have it. And after I use it, he sniffs the air & tracks it down. :-)",5
"light weight and thin but durable and easy to attach to harness, perfect for my two little chihuahuas",5
The scent isn't worth purchasing in my opinion. I can't remember the other brand that smells stronger and better than this one unfortunately.,2
"We run a dog rescue and we purchased this to work with a Doberman Great Dane mix who is currently 96 lbs with zero training. He bucked like a bronco on the leash and with both the halti and the gentle leader so we purchased this. It has worked wonders. With the training collar, time and patience he has turned the corner and on the road to obedience and a forever home.",4
The UV light was not working even though I received instruction from the community. I rotated the filter 180 degree trying to match the magnet with the Uv light. But it didn't work. The manufacturer should send a new one to me. But I don't know how to contact them.,3
SAME Product as petsmat only 50% cheaper,5
"The buckle color.  In the picture and description it says chrome with grey buckles, but in the actual product it's all black hardware.  It's a minor detail, but I didn't want to fuss with returning it.
Other than that, it's a great harness.  The buckle is strong and holds back a pulling dog.  It's very soft.",4
"I have pit bulls who usually devour anything without a problem, but these rawhides made all 3 dogs sick.  One kept vomiting all night until pieces came up, and the other 2 were okay with it.  The next time I gave them to the other dogs who were ok with it only, and they both choked and gagged them up.  Don't know why, they have had rawhides like this before and they are not made in China, but I would definitely not buy them again.  They may be swallowing them too fast, but there is no way to stop that!  So beware!  I really was happy to find this product as it was priced nice, but would not risk it again.",1
"The dogs love the taste, and think its a treat.",5
I have a Maltese with skin problems. I had tried every topical product from the Vet- nothing was working. I decided to give the sensitive skin food a try. All of his skin problems have cleared up. I am sold on this product 100%.,5
Quality ingredients.  It was one of 3 brands recommended by our vet when the dog was just 2 months old.,5
I ordered all of the cat food ($200.00 worth) for my sister in New York City as her foot had been broken by being driven over by a tourist horse and buggy. She was on her bike in Central Park.  She has two cats and I knew she would have a hard time getting not only to the grocery store but to Petco where she purchases this type of cat food.  So I told my Mother I could get it all on Amazon and have it delivered to her apartment building..  My sister told me what kind to get (she still didn't know why I was asking) and I ordered all of it.  She was overwhelmed when it was all delivered as it has been one less thing she needs to worry about while she heals her foot. I got her the cat food in both the soft and hard type.,5
"These are 6"" and a bit heavy to have bounced off your foot.",3
"My 17  pound Papillon mix needed to wear a cone after having a mass removed from her back leg.  As we all know, we spend huge amounts of money in vet bills, and they send us home with a fifty cent piece of plastic for a cone.  I purchased the Comfy Cone in a small.  She sleeps well with the Comfy Cone and is already back to running around and barking at things while wearing the cone.  (I don't think she looks too scary with the cone, but I'm not going to tell her that.)  She is able to eat and drink with the cone on and pretty much does all normal dog things while wearing it.  I definitely recommend it.",5
Worked great,5
It's reasonable and the cat likes it.,5
My dogs love it. It doesn't crack or splinter. It also smells nice not like the regular cow hooves. Good purchase.,5
Good product but a little expensive,4
"Though I have no proof I believe that this litter gave my rats both mites and a respiratory infection (and I am just using it in the litter box, not around the whole cage). It is not as dust free as they lead to believe. I am now switching to unscented Yesterdays News for cats, hoping this litter will be better!",2
"Had this for about a month, I haven't needed to refill it yet!

Don't underestimate how large these are!

Using one of these outdoors for the single dog and one of these indoors for the dog and cat.

These things hold a ton of water and auto-fill perfectly, no leaks so far!",4
Great Poop bags. Nice size!,5
My kitties love these.,5
Definitely big enough for my dwarf hamster with extra room. So if you have a Syrian or even a small rat it would probably work great.,5
These are incredible if you have dog that pulls like a sled dog.,5
This toy is too feeble for big dogs.,2
The chickens can't resist them!,5
"I like this product, it does what it's supposed to, and maybe it's just my cheap couch, but this pulls a bunch of lint as well as cat fur.  I have one of those fiber couches that fur gets stuck between the stitching and it's hard to get out, and this does the trick, but it's somewhat difficult because once you get the fur out of the couch, static cling kicks in and the fur sticks to the brush.  I've tried vacuuming, lint rolling, duct tape and this brush, and the brush works the best in conjunction with a vacuum hose to be the most effective.",3
"I use these in his treat thing that he has to move around to get them out, I mix it with the party mix naturals also. He loves it!",5
Our cats devour these treats and meow for more...,4
Great item,5
"I bought the Tug-a-Jug after having bought the Twist n Treat. It's a good toy, but I would say it's ideal for a dog of above-average intelligence. The Twist n Treat only requires your dog to nose it over. This one has a more complex mechanism that requires more work. Our dog couldn't get much out of it the first few tries but she is very food motivated and now can empty one in about an hour or so. The advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good. In all, I like this toy, because it's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser, which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her. If you are looking for a first food-dispensing toy, I would recommend getting the Twist n Treat first, however.",5
Possibly the most played with toy for both of my cats. They LOVE these springs. Would recommend to any cat owner and will repurchase in the future.,5
"The Doberman loved to dig out all the stuffing, but also likes to have a baby to take to bed. The female ones with the pink nails and eyelashes are cute!",5
"I have to respectfully disagree with the others that gave this a high rating and good comments.  I have used the Tidy Cats brand for many years and have never had any complaints.  I was happy that they came out with a lightweight version and purchased it for my one cat. Mistake! This stuff is useless!! The only thing it does do is make your house smell like a combo of cat litter and cat poop. As soon as I poured it in the litter box I was overwhelmed by the odor of the litter itself. For several days after that, even though I kept the box clean, all I could smell was cat litter and a lingering smell of cat urine/poop. I will never buy this version again and I urge you not to as well!!",1
"Wonderful product, I have ordered many times.",5
"My dogs love this oil drizzled on their food every day.  Their coats shine and they don't itch.  Really seems to keep the allergies at bay.  It always smells fresh, even in the big bottle.",5
"Cat's loved it in the beginning but are losing their taste for it. Probably too many cans of the same food, they would like variety. Overall good product.",4
"This is either the smartest thing or my dumbest idea. It works, he was trained right away but he rings the bell to play outside which is very annoying. I need to figure out a different way to determine what he wants. ",5
"It seems okay for what it is, but my rats had no interest in it and just pooped all over it instead.",2
"Our dog had to have surgery to remove Gaul-stones.  Our vet recommended Royal Canin Urinary S0 dog food and we added this to his meals.  It worked!  No more stones!  I believe this helped along with the dog food.  We bought the food at the vet's office for $40 per 12 cans.  It is much, much, much more expensive on Amazon.",5
"Very happy with these. I've reordered since I need to keep my dog's foot bandaged. They come in a variety of colors. The first box had really nice primary colors. The second package had darker, muted colors, which I don't like as well. But the tape works really well and you can't beat the cost and convenience. Would definitely recommend these.",5
Excellent product.,5
Pretty print and the martingale has cut down on my puppy's pulling when out for a walk.,4
"Smells bad, cats ate it but they always threw it up right away, even got a bad bag once and all they did was puke. Immediately tossed it and went with something else. I don't recommend this food and neither do my six cats.",1
Great Bags,5
"Meal times have gone from a 2 minute dangerous inhaled meal to a 20 minute game where we don't have to worry about bloat, and with dual puppies - anything that wears off some of that excess energy is a wonderful thing.

You do need a nice clear 3ft circle for them to move freely around in all directions as they push food out & eat.

Neither dog has been able to chew them, tip them over, or steal them and run off to the back yard with them (as they do with just about anything not bolted down)

Our dogs are 50 & 65 lbs, with both the standard blocky head and short snout and neither have a problem getting the food out of the large version.",5
My pups love these. It gives them something to chew on so keeps them from destructive chewing behaviors.,5
"Good, low-priced alternatives to Greenies.",5
We have two dogs poms and they love them. Will be buying them again.,5
Need another larger size.,5
"Not good for a dog that's a chewer , ears are easily chewed off",3
My dog loves these! They only last a few minutes... She's 80lbs.  It's hard to gauge how much good it does her teeth tho. But these are available elsewhere (think large membership box store) for significantly less. I paid less than $10. I'd recommend shopping around.,3
Little too big for my Westie.,4
"So far this shock collar works, only down fall is the plastic pc that is suppose to make the shocking device stay on collar (it doesn't stay in place) it took a minute to figure out the controller. I set the setting all the way up cause it wouldn't get my Aussie attention. My previous shock collar was simple easy to use and my dogs bad behavior was correct immediately. I almost thought this collar was defective, because all the reviews I read this one was good, and has a 1 year warranty(which isn't common) I had my husband put it on his leg and still didn't shock. You have to hold the shock button down as it slowly goes up to the setting you put it on, and bam it worked! I love that it has a beep sound before vibrate, i use that the most. Overall once I figured it out. It's a good shock collar.",4
"This litter clumps OK, but it doesn't control odor very well. They also have a scent in it that gets really obnoxious and overpowering.",3
Three of my 4 cats love these!,5
I chose this cover because it was padded and comfortable for the older dog as we traveled for any distance.  The interior of the back of my car is still like new thanks to the protection of the cover.  It is easy to put in and seure.,5
I have 3 dogs and they love to get new balls.  I purchased several packs of these and keep them in the closet for special treats -- when the dogs see me getting them out they get so excited.  Great item at very nice price.,5
It has to go over the head.  My dog hates that.  I would love to find one that Clips on both the front and the back so it's very easy to put on.,3
I am using this a water bowl for a small green snake and small skink...It is too shallow.,3
My cats love to play with this thing.  All four of them will gather around to get it.  It needs to be low to the ground so that the beam will hit the floor for your cats to catch.  We've only played with it a few times because it's so noisy and annoying sounding.,3
"Bottom line: this didn't work for our Corgi puppy. He's nearly housebroken now, though, so he only eliminates on walks.",2
"Good quality, thick, durable, and much brighter colors than the picture shows.  Very please with my purchase.  No complaints at all.",5
"Pookie, my conure, loves this.",5
smelly but works well.,5
"Could not understand how the cats kept popping the guards off so easily. After I locked them into place the cats enjoyed it, wish the ball was a little more interesting to the cats.",4
Comes in handy on our hikes!,5
"So, I got this at the health food store  and it is just fine as cocao butter goes --- but I have a huge problem with the intentionally faulty  information about the sourcing of this product, especially seeing it online here: first because it is incorrect, and second because it seems to intentionally dupe the consumer into buying the product based on this false information.  Cacao butter is a pretty interchangeable product in its raw form, but the sellers make a big deal about how it is from ""11k feet, in cusco"" but plants cannot survive at that altitude.  In fact if you've been to Machu Picchu you know this because it is freezing and dry.  Cacao is grown in the high jungle of South America.  Cacao is grown in a humid environment and cannot stand the freezing nighttime tempertures.  According to the rainforest alliance: ""Cacao trees usually grow below altitudes of 1,000 feet in areas that receive about 4 inches of rain per month. They cannot survive in very dry weather and thrive in climates with high humidity and rainfall. These plants are shade-tolerant and thrive in moist, nutrient-rich, well-drained, deep soils."" Few things grow at 11k feet above sea level, most of those things are potatoes.  Anyway I'll be trying a different brand like Milliard next.  Buy this if you want raw cacao butter, but don't buy it because it has some special nutritional value for being grown at high altitude.  It doesn't, and shame on the manufacturers for pretending.",1
"Its kitty litter, my cat poops and pees in it what more is there to say.",4
Product arrived in bad condition. Nothing but crumbs.,1
I use the pellet type bedding so this is a nice ad-in for my robo hamsters to nest with. Came packaged perfectly and just as described. Pleasure doing business with this company.,4
"I just received my collar and it was very easy to charge and sync.  The instructions were pretty clear.  I fitted it for my Doberman and it was a good fit.  I believe it could fit a much smaller or larger size dog as well as its very adjustable.  I bought it because my dog is extremely well trained however he has been a little stubborn on the come when called command and he runs too fast for me to catch him easily.  I took him outside and put him on a long line so we could practice.  I asked him to come and he didn't so I beeped the collar.  He didn't react so I asked him again and then vibrated the collar (the vibration is just like a cell phone vibration).  He slightly reacted but didn't come to me so I asked again and shocked on a level one with no reaction so I asked again and shocked on a level two and he yelped, jumped and ran to me.  After that I never had to shock him again.  I asked him to come and he didn't at first so I vibrated the collar and he ran to me.  I had to vibrate one more time and after that he came on the first request every time.  He was a little panicked when we went back inside and threw somewhat of a fit like he may have been scared he would feel the shock again but I don't think I will ever need to shock him again.  I think I will be able to use just the beep and vibrate function as a warning(the beep) and a correction (the vibrate).  I am very pleased with this reaction and will continue to have him wear it and practice until he is fully trained but I feel like he finally understands he has to come when I ask him to and not run away.",5
Constantly getting compliments on this collar- LOvE the turtles and the durability. Switched to Lupine brand after my lab mix pup went through 2 Kong brand collars- the buckle  broke (or partially broke) for no apparent reason and either weren't functional or I didn't feel safe entrusting the product with my pup. Petsmart and Kong both refused to refund or replace the collars because each time it was just over their 30day return policy.  Love that Lupine has lifetime warranty! I recommend this brand to everyone!,5
"Very well made harness, fits my 10 lb pomeranian perfectly in the medium, the only thing I would like changed is the extra rope portion that holds the ring. I wonder if its like that to offer a more adjustable size but it just ends up bouncing around when I let my guy off the leash. Since he's so fluffy the bowtie portion gets covered but the buttons are cute going down the chest.",5
Perfect container for in the go dog food!!!,5
nice,5
My dog now has a night light when we walk.,5
Great assortment!,5
"I bought this for my large DYH Amazon. He had never used one before and took to it right away. He LOVES it and it is a great way to bond with your bird. Try to out the perch around mid-chest level and  out of the heavy stream of water. Birds like more of a mist or very light misting/shower. NEVER use any soap or shampoo on your bird and make sure none splashes her.
Even though it says Large, it has a nice ""grippy"" perch that I think you could get almost anything larger than a cockatiel/budgie/lovebird on.  Use tepid water and SING away, your bird will soon be joining you screaming in joy and bathing,  This Amazon is a 22 yr old rescue who had never showered on a shower perch before, he took to it right and it accelerated our bonding.",5
"Works great my dog was losing fur on his butt because of the fles, ticks or something but now only after two bathes his fur is growing back and he's doesn't itch at all around his butt like he use to.",5
"So far so good, wish it could adjust smaller than it allows. Can also just put the seatbelt through the bottom loop if you would prefer also! Or for different kind of belt buckles. Works fine",5
Perfect for fixing my munchkins nails!,5
This is great food Very healthy for your Dog!!! I Highly recommend and my dogs love it !!! Mix with some Dry Food and your dog will be in Heaven!!!,5
"It's hard to tell if it works but I am fairly sure it does. My pets are getting into their senior years and their teeth are not nearly as bad as most pets. I don't brush often, it's impossible to brush cats teeth and my dog fusses so much. So I've taken to a lot of water dental additives and chews.",4
Great container for dog food..I love the screw top design..!!,5
Absolutely LOVE IT!! Very cool at night. Bought the Blue which looks fantastic on my dog who is black. Very very cool. Thank you so much!!,5
"It is on the loud side no matter what I do, the vibrations are unavoidable. I bought this to replace a Tetra whisper air pump designed for a 40 gallon aquarium, which died out of nowhere about 3 months into use. I hope I have better luck with this new purchase.",3
"tons of fun and rugged for lots of play. Kong products are so well made. My mini poodle destroys most toys within an hour but not the Kong toys! I recommend this one. There are two squeakers which my dogs love. Great product, I highly recommend. Great seller",5
not the best dog verly eats it,3
"My dog has a favorite ball, and I have spent hundred of dollars trying to find another ball. I finally found one. He loves this ball and now I am going to order another one, but in a larger size so that my dog does not choke. I can see if you had a heavy chewer, where there might be an issue. But my dog loves it. Thank you guys so much for making this product. You are a life saver.",5
"These were a wise purchase! I got a discounted sample for review, and I chose to buy them for use with dealing with cat litter, not dog poo.

I have two foster cats at the moment and keeping up with maintaining the litter boxes is really not fun. I rejected the idea of a Litter Genie and things like it, as I have three boxes and don't want to move litter receptacles all over the place. These bags are pretty much a lifesaver!

Unlike plastic grocery bags, these don't have tiny holes that can cause leaks. They're thicker and thus sturdier than the produce-style bags I'd tried before. They're a great size for scooping in clumping litter. And this is a package of about a million of them, so I won't be running out all that soon.

Totally recommend these for helping with cat box maintenance!",5
"Okay, so this product is actually fine and is working for now.  That said, I have a HUGE problem with the customer service and warranty support of Aqeuon.

I have a red-eared slider in a 75 gallon tank (50 gallons of water) with a screen top.  Aqueon claims that the Pro 200 should have been sufficient to heat the tank to a consistent 80 degrees.  It actually did for about 3 months and then something must have happened with one of the elements inside as I could not get it to go above 71 degrees--which left for too long like that would put the turtle into a hibernation state.

When I called emailed Aqueon I let them know that I would need some sort of advanced replacement as the heater was working and keeping the water at 71 degrees (in 65 degree basement).  The ""service"" rep said that I would need the original receipt (which I obviously no longer have) and I would need to ship it back to them paying the shipping costs!!  Some warranty.  I reiterated that I would have to buy another one at a local store while I waited for the replacement.  Then she proceeded to quote me ""company policy"".  Really, Aqueon.  Fortunately turtles are pretty durable so it could deal with the low temperatures for a while.  Good thing they weren't fish.

So, I went ahead and purchased this Pro250 from Amazon for $31 (as opposed to $60 at PetSmart, which is another story).  I love me my Amazon.  I suppose I'll keep the replacement as a backup for when the new one dies--hopefully in a year or two at least.

I'll update this if all goes well.  In the meantime, buy this only if you are prepared to treat it as disposable.

If there are any aquatic turtle owners out there that have run across a good submersible heater alternative for a 75+ gallon tank, please let me know.  Thanks!!!

Update 10/16/14-- so I'm upgrading my review on this from 1-star to 3-stars as I think the new product I purchased is pretty good.  Steady temperature and is heating to my RES needed 83-degrees even with a screen top.  Would probably go higher than that if I didn't have the customer service/warranty issue.",3
"purchased a ""cheaper"" clipper set with all the combs....but i really needed something to give my bichon mix a finished look. picked this up with a couple of blade attachments and he just looks awesome. these are great powerful clippers.",5
"These are factory replacements. Perfect fit, easy to use. Effecitve. Parts were received on time and in good condition. I have two Eheim Canisters and will be reordering this product soon.",5
Good value. No problem with the bags.,5
My German Shepherds don't really like it.,3
My cat won't lounge on it but she does love scratching it!  I wish the carboad scratcher surface was a little tighter.  She's tearing it apart quite easily.,4
"very good made, dog loves it",5
I got the large abutilon. It's bigger than I expected and perfect for my crested gecko. Great price too,5
Cats like this flavor and to help prevent hairball problems.,5
really seemed to help a friend's cat with his arthritic gait.,5
"Our incredibly picky dog liked this food, but we found that it constipated him. We have not had this problem with other foods, so we know it was the new food. We won't be buying it next time.",2
"My 6 mo old Labradoodle is an aggressive chewer. She has chewed the legs of my cherry furniture, edges of my baseboards and lets not get started on shoes.  I had purchased the usual age appropriate chewing toys but nothing held her attention until I gave her a tendon. Its been over a hour and shes still going to town!",5
"These dishes stick way out in the cage and both of the ones I received had mal-formed threads on the stem for attachment to the cage, so a wrench had to be used to get them off, once I got them on and they did not fit tightly against the cage, but wobbled. Making them any tighter would have broken the plastic connector. They are too big even for a large parakeet cage and my birds avoided them completely. I removed them and put in pinch type tubes which they went to immediately.",2
I would recommend Puppia products to anyone. This is the second time I've purchased this harness...only because I wanted new ones for my little doggies. The ones they had were fine. They are well made and I love the color. Thank you.,5
completely and utterly pointless,1
"A very cute collar.  My girl looks very cute in it!  It has held up well so far (it's been about 2 months).  No fraying or wear showing, and the pattern has not faded.",4
"What a waste of money.  I can get these for humans at the dollar store. Which is what I did in heavy absorbency.  Btw, these are for light absorbency.",1
"I recently adopted my first puppy and I was searching for a good nail clipper. I came across this awesome nail clipper on Amazon. Since this was my first time using a nail clipper, there were no accidents. It is very firm and does the job. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family members to use it on their dogs. The trimmer works miracles. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I don't plan on replacing it in the future. Thank you.",5
"My chinchilla absolutely loves these biscuits as a treat and they do not mess with her digestive system at all.  It is nice to have an affordable high quality treat not full of filler, sugar and seeds.  It pains me to see the pet food and treats that they pawn in pet stores that is NOT good for small pets.  The organic barley biscuits are a welcome addition to my Chinchilla's diet.",5
This is a cute little toy but i should have paid more attention to just how small it is. This toy is REALLY small. It would be gook for a Yorkie or similar size micro dog. My 17 lb mini schnauzer practically swallows it.,3
My dog waits every night to have her teeth brushed. We use this along with a gauze pad to go over her teeth with. Our vet is always happy with how clean her teeth are.,5
"It went together easily enough and looks nice. It does seem a little wobbly at the top, though. If I were a cat I think I'd like it, but my cat does not.",3
"I'm trying to get my kitties switched over to some healthier food an eliminate some skin issues with one of them.  My Booger cat is allergic to red dye so I really have to be careful on my purchases.  I wanted to make sure he wasn't allergic to grains too.  Two out of three of my cats really like this brand.  It's also fairly small, smaller than most brands.  This is also great for Booger because he doesn't like to chew his food all the time and I end up having to clean up undigested, vomited cat food...on my carpet.  Not fun.  Haven't had that issue with this.",5
My dog goes crazy over these she runs to where they are and practically begs for them! There quite big and shes tiny so we break them up and they last a long time will definetly be buying these again =),5
hard to squeeze water out of bottle,2
great product our dog loves to swim and so far it is holding up,5
"Though the cats would love this, but they pretty much ignore it.  It's made well, but I guess they like what they like and they don't like this one.",3
"This lightweight pet crate is easily assembled, well
made and sturdy.  It perfectly accommodated my dog
on a long road trip and served as her crate in the house
when we arrived. A great alternative to all-metal crates, it
was easy for this 100-pound owner to handle.",5
"My dogs love these. They take them a few min to eat, but not as long as some bully sticks. I'm not sure what the difference is, but for the price these are still a great chew.",5
Fits my Tetra 1900gph pump perfectly. I just ordered medium density matala filter pad to replace the brushes that come with the box. Liking the skimmer net design as well! Already saved a few fish and frogs.,5
Package arrived safely. Contents of package appear to work well. Kids like brushing the bunny with the soft brush. Happy with the purchase so far.,5
"Love the colors, patterns and lightness of these stairs. My dogs use them all the time. They're expensive for what they are: foam covered with fabric.",5
My dogs love it and I feel it is helpful for them,5
"This ball is teeny tiny but the perfect size for my 8week old Yorkie. I have a bigger one for my full grown yorkie. I stuff fabric strips in it because he likes to tear apart his toys. This way, he feels as though he is destroying it but he's not! This is a perfect idea for those dogs that like to ruin all their toys!",5
"My 13.5 year old GSD was having issues not being able to jump on our high California King sized bed.  It was really bothering him and truly sad to watch. His desire was there just not his ability without sliding backwards. He is 90#! All other steps were made of flimsy materials,  made for a small dog, large cat, it extremely expensive $100 on up range! NOT what I was in need of at all.  I ordered these steps using Prime.  It arrived in 2 days as promised, easy to assemble as promised, I only needed to coax him 2 times to use it. It's nice and durable plastic. It has carpet adhesive strips so he don't slide.
Now he waits for me to say ""wait for your steps, Bo"".
That happiness is back in my boy!
Thank you for making such a fabulous and durable product.",5
"Rubs my dogs Dew Claw. Other than that, they are wonderful (we put socks on her and that seemed to work).",3
Our Pups love Three Dog,5
I used these for my Siberian Huskies and they stopped pulling right away! Love this product and comfortable for my pets! Highly recommended if your dog is a puller!,5
Have not used this yet but...this would have been perfect if it had a little spout on it..to pour into a smaller urine cup container.,3
My little pug was born with a defect in her bladder muscles and this product helps her in so many ways. She loves the flavor so taking this is not an issue. She doesn't have any accidents when she takes this supplement!,5
My 4-month old kitty didn't care for these so it's a thumbs down for me.,2
Neither of my dogs liked this toy. I gave it to my sons puppy. The puppy did not play with it either. I then donated it to the humane society.,1
My dog loved the bone but it didn't last long. A fast chew for strong dogs.,4
cats love it  I like the convenience,5
"Warm, sturdy rip-stop material and secure closures. Only velcro is in the neck protector for warmth.",5
"Perfect size for our chubby 2 month old Labrador with room for a bowl and a toy. Building this kennel took a little bit of elbow grease, but it is quite sturdy and durable. The door can be removed if needed and door knobs are easy to use.",4

She prefers the taste of Temptations treats, so I was happy to see they had a snack toy with holes made specifically to fit this treat shape. She had an egg-shaped treat ball before, but it was hard for her to use because the opening was made for round treats and, due to its shape and her frustration, she kept smacking it hard into walls (cracking it) and underneath the couch. At night, it was easy to accidentally trip over. This one, on the other hand, is shaped so that it specifically keeps it rolling around within a square yard of where you set it down, so it won't end up lost underneath my furniture.

As soon as I had opened the (frustration free) packaging, filled it up, and presented the mousy to her, she was smitten. I apologize for the vertical video - here is my kitty seeing this snack mouse for the first time. She was able to figure it out right away and within a minute I had to adjust the settings because she was getting too many treats out of it! Even after adjusting, she still managed to eat every treat out of it within three minutes... ""clever girl"".",5
My dogs gobble up this supplement when I put it on their dry food and it works great going out the other end too!,5
Omega 3 is recommended for growing pups.  Cut capsule open and squeeze the fish oil on our pup's dry kibble food.  She loves the flavor and gobbles it up.,5
"My cat likes the ""chikapee chip"" toy, but it's appeared to be too loud for the owner. :) Nothing like a pleasant chirping of a real bird. Alarming high-pitched sound. I could not tolerate it for more than a minute. I don't think it should be so loud. Cats have no problems with hearing, so the sound could be way more gentle and subtle. I would not recommend this to those who are sensitive to the noise. The idea itself is good and the toy is cute, but I think some adjustments are needed.",2
My dog loves them and got them without any problems.,5
"I wasn't too sure about this product at first, but I foster a lot of cats and kittens and stomach issues always arise. I mainly use it when I hear that tell tale sign that all cat parents are familiar with when a cat is about to throw up. I run to get this stuff and squirt it in their mouth before they throw up and...and...they DON'T throw up! Seems to work. I don't use it as a dropper though, I take a 1ml syringe and I squirt about .3ml into the syringe and then administer it. I was still skeptical, because I noticed that when I do the same thing with olive oil, they don't throw up either.

What made me give this 5 stars is how it worked on 2 cats on the same day. Both didn't eat their lunch and clearly weren't feeling well. One was having diarrhea cause of changing food (I was cat sitting her and the owners didn't bring be her regular food), the other had a stressful day (feral kitten who I had allowed out to play with stranger cats). I gave both of them .3ml of this stuff and within 30 minutes they both ate their lunch. Worth having around.",5
"These are OK and my pup uses them--sometimes. They are a plus because my pup rips up the disposable ones and plays with them, shred by shred.",3
Durable but soft enough not to hurt their teeth.  Works great with the Chuckit! flinger apparatus.,5

"My elderly dog LOVES her Serta bed so much that we bought a second one. I wish that it were a darker color overall to hide stains, but otherwise I think that this is a great ortho dog bed!",5
Great for when connecting ha stats together.,5
chickens love it,5
My cat likes it I use it for both sides they should make bigger then that,4
"My 2-year old Golden is a monster chewer and he loves to play with this rope, either nibbling/shredding it on his own, or playing tug with a person.  These ropes are surprisingly long-lasting, but if you've got a power player like me, be prepared for lots of loose bits of thread/rope lying around. My Golden will drag this rope out of his toy tub, drag it around the house, and even lay it down on someone's lap, demanding playtime.  These ropes must be pretty popular with other owners because sometimes I have a hard time finding them in stores or online.",5
"Use as needed. You will need two people to get this into cats ear. Wear protective gear, eyeglasses and face mask. Be sure cats claws are trimmed.",5
My Pups favorite treat ,5
I needed something as my dogs are always running in the woods and fields in TN. They pick up ticks and everything else in their ears. It has helped with their itching and with cleaning their ears.,5
Good product and good price.,5
"We use this for our cats at work and they seem to love it. Empty bowls every day! The price is right online and much
less expensive that the pet store we were buying it from originally. Came in 2 days right to the office...couldn't ask
for anything better than that.",5
"A very good generic fitting seat cover. Since it is made to fit many different vehicles, it isn't a custom fit for any particular car. The materials.seem to be sturdy and well put together.  We have no pets that travel with us, but do have a grandson, which can potentially be much messier than the average dog. My only wish is for some way to allow for a split rear seat like our Subaru has. If we need to lay down only one side it requires we unhook one of the rear headrest straps. A minor inconvenience to be sure, but I did say it was just a wish.  Overall a fine product, and will hopefully help grandson proof our back seat.",4
"Excellent at maintaining GI health while on ABX.  My kitten is on eight weeks of antibiotics, and didn't have any GI upset at all with this product!  Huge lifesaver!",5
My cats love it. It's the perfect size and sturdy.,5
I bought paypen for a kitten my mom brought home for my daughter. He refuses to share litter box with older male cat after trying 3 litter boxes through out the house with no luck..Found that he uses litter box locked up in crate seperated from other cat this was a perfect buy! Playpen was lil trying to put together by myself (sides are lil floppy) but once you get sides up goes together nicely..only down fall is sides are lil uneven and may need to use zip straps to help hold sides tight.. Shipping was very fast ordered two days ago recieved it and kitten loves it!!!,4
I have bought several of these for my very active Boston Terrier and is the only style I use to tie her outside.,5
The oil itself is good and it seems to help my dog with his permanent shoulder problem. Why four stars? Because the pump broke and now every time I use it I get all that smelly oil all over my hand...,4
"This is one of those items that the term ""you get what you pay for"" stands true. The quality of the lenses are not good enough to last around a dog with paws and claws. My dog took it off within a few seconds of me putting it on. One good note is that my son likes to wear it more than my dog. I originally purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my review, and I was hoping that it would work since it seemed like a good idea. So while I think it is a good pair of goggles, I do not think it will last anyone very long.",3
"My fault for not knowing what was buying and marking ""just okay"" because it is very messy and stinky. I ended up throwing away, but again...my fault. If you know how to use this stuff, you get quite a lot and I thought price reasonable.",3
The leash and harness are a great bargain however it didn't work out for my dog.,3
My dog is extremely picky so I often have to change his food due to boredom. He loved it at first and then not so much. Once blended with another he continued to eat it. It's a great food and he does like it. He is just sick of dry food. I totally understand.,4
"My dog has head this dragon for months now, and I see no signs of rips or tears. He likes to hold it by the wings and shake it, mostly, and also squeak the obnoxiously loud squeaker.",5
"I received this pet carrier today, just in time to bring home my new kitty tomorrow!  The photos are true to the actual colors.  I got the grey and light blue model.  The carrier is a bit smaller than I thought but it will fit an adult cat just fine.  I marked it 4 stars because of the quality of the material.  It is cheaper plastic and is fragile at the joints.  When unclasping the lid joints from unboxing, some of the joints were stuck and I had to pry hard to get them to open.  Two of the corner joints almost broke off because the plastic is brittle.  One of the corner screws just spins like it's stripped.  Another screw cap is deformed and won't tighten correctly.  The carrier comes with 5 screw sets (one is extra) so I'm left with 3 working correctly.  I'm not worried about the carrier splitting open because there are 4 side clasps, 4 corner clasps, and 4 screws to hold the box together.  The door does not open and close smoothly as the top and bottom carrier pieces don't align perfectly.  It's not too big a problem though, just takes a slight bit of effort.  The top of the unit comes with 2 food and water (?) slots with covers that are nice extras.  The lids of the two compartments are hard to open, like the rest of the carrier clasps.  Overall, I'm happy with the product because it looks nice and fits my needs.  I got this through Amazon's Black Friday deal so I'm not too disappointed for the price I paid ($15).  If it goes on sale again, I'd buy another for my other cat.",4
Very durable.  I have a total of two dogs that the combine weight is 32 lbs. The only problem is it's hard to steer with those low budget wheels.,4
tiny not a bath house for a chinchilla,1
After using the product for a few months I ahhh pleased with it. Function is as advertised.,5
My dog loves these. They are not the healthiest snack because of the calories but I would buy these again.,4
"My Axies love this and it keeps them happy. Well, you can't tell for sure if this is the reason :)",5
"I had to go three stars simply because my dog didn't like it... however, just like humans dogs have different tastes so who knows if yours will!  Doing research beforehand this food is quality-made, but again, ole' Shadow just didn't like it.",3
As expected.,5
I  use these for a 12 lb chihuahua and in my cat's litter box.  They are very absorbent and hold up well. I definitely recommend these. I have always used 4 paws but these are pretty close.,5
"Both of my cats LOVE to sit on what we call 'The X"" especially in the winter when it's over the furnace vent. However, my one kitty is a BIG boy of 16 pounds and he has now broken two of these. If the cardboard break, this is impossible to fix, so I give it 3 stars.  If you have smaller kitties, it will probably be just fine.",3
It goes through his fur easily and with soap.,4
"TetraPond 26596 Waterfall Filter, Very good filter. I bought an extra replacement pad and switch them out when I clean them. Will add picture when I get it installed with my surrounding rocks and ground cover.",5
"I just started using this product so I cannot comment on it yet. If it is as good as their other products, I will  be most happy",5
"I want to preface my review by stating that I got this door for indoor use, and if you're looking for a door to go on the outside then there are better options out there than this one. But for use indoors, this one fits the bill just fine.

I have five cats, and one is on a diet. I previously had a cat bowl on a counter top that only four could reach, but when my fat cat learned to make the jump I had to come up with a different solution. I decided I needed to make a feeding box, and the four cats that could eat whenever they want would have magnetic collars that would allow them access but would keep the cat on a diet out.

The installation instructions recommend installing the door at a height between 4""-6"". I measured my cats and installed it at a 5"" on my temporary cardboard feeding box, but they were having trouble the first few days with getting the magnets on their collars to trigger the door because their magnets were still too high up. I raised the box up by 2"" (to a 7"" total height) and they now have a much easier time getting in. So try a test run to see just how much effort it takes for your cat to get the magnet to activate before you cut into an actual door. All four cats were able to adjust quickly after I fixed the height issues.",4
Very nice and my shrimp love them,5
This has been a life saver for me! My dog is allergic to EVERYTHING! This works so well and he had no reaction. I think it has really helped with his itchy skin. It makes a nice lather and I feel really good about using a natural product with great ingredients.,5
a little smaller than i thought,3
"Haven't used it enough to comment on the battery life or durability, but it has worked well for me so far. Plenty big for my dog's massive neck!",5
Just right for connecting two collars. Walking a deaf dog with two collars. This is just right.,5
"Perfect, I order these for my daughter's older dog and they work fine.",5
Love them,5
works well;nice size,5
"Our three female cats - 2 adults one kitten absolutely love this. We have the green tower food puzzle thing and the round purple floor food puzzle too, but this is the only one that really works for sharing. It is my go to treat dispenser now. Highly recommend!",5
It was completely torn up within 3 hours. Not well made at all. Waste of money.,1
Order these cans of food monthly.  Cats' favorite and they come right to the door.,5
"Nice looking, good fit and easy to put on.",5
"My Dogs Love These and when you order from Amazon, you don't get a bag of broken bones like from another well known pet supply website.",5
"The only,  and I  mean only food my dogs will eat.",5
Cats really loved this thing.  I barely got it unpacked and they were attacking it.  It's really well made and pretty large.  I wasn't expecting much because the price is pretty good but I would highly recommend it...depending on how aggressive your cat is they may end up destroying it after a while.  after about 6 months it is really showing some wear and tear.,5
"My dog loves to have her teeth brushed with the soft fiber fingerbrush, rather than a rubber one or a toothbrush. I like that I get a really good ""feel"" of her teeth to notice any changes. Don't be scared off by the price! Buy atleast 2 and after using clean it with hydrogen peroxide and squezze it dry. Rotate - I have found that my last 3 brushes last for years. One disappear in the last year and another has finally gotten stained, so I ready to order 2 more. Your dog will like it much more than a toothbrush!",5
these are the best ones I have used,5
"I have been feeding Lafeber's Premium Daily Diet to my Green Wing Macaw for the entire nineteen years of her life. It's a great product!!! I decided to check Amazon one day  and was thrilled to see it offered at a slight discount. It is delivered right to my door, how convenient is that? THANK YOU AMAZON!!! from Chili (the Green wing) and me ; )",5
"I purchased these about a week ago for my long-haired tuxedo.  The cons are the smell (the cat doesn't seem to mind, though) and the size.  My cat has a relatively large mouth and teeth but has trouble eating them.  Despite this, he loves them and is happy to eat more!  Most importantly, his random hacking noises and actual hairballs have stopped thus far.  In the past, I've tried hairball remedied food as well as some pastes that I've purchased from the vet (he hated those) and nothing has worked as quickly as these.  Highly recommended!",5
awesome,5
I began cooking for my two 90 pound dogs in January. These are essential for their health. I like that they are 365 count so I will get 6 months out of them. They love the taste!,5
A good product but my fussy cat did not like it!,4
This really does work.  I was skeptical but tried it since I have three collies and a Samoyed.  You must keep it level with the couch as you are brushing but the hair comes right off!,5
"This is a nice strong product. It has held up well to my puppy chewing on it even though she doesn't really understand it well. She has chewed it with her pup razor teeth without destroying the kong. This is a nice way to give your dog treats but making them work for it.

Check out my profile to see a link to my puppy blog if you are interested.

Thanks for reading",5
"Haven't had to use the refills yet, the one that came with the Drinkwell fountain is still in good working condition (only a about 3 weeks old). The first filter has worked great thus far - has kept fur out of the water and trapped some food flecks, so I'd expect that the refills would as good of a job as the original filter.
Only issue - the filter doesn't go all the way to the top of the waterline. So there is the occasional hair(s) that floats over and back out into the main water bowl. If I lift the filter up (only about 1/8th an inch) then it stops the floaters but then if there is anything stuck down in the bottom it gets pushed up and out into the bowl. So it would be nice if the filters were a tiny bit taller.",4
The quality of the bags is incredible and unlike so many others you don't have to struggle to tear them at the perforation line.  The bag holder is sturdy and not going to lose it's cap.  The clasp to attach it to the leash is a bit difficult but you know it's not going to break or fall off once you get it attached.,5
"It did not help with my dog's thyroid condition. As a matter of fact, her numbers dropped even lower.",1
"Best bang for the buck......great ability to program any lighting schedule.  No need for a separate wall timer for night/day lights.

Also has a built in time saver.  If you lose power or unplug the light system...it saves your settings and sets the correct time when plugged back in/power turns back on.  Not sure how long the setting saver will last but my toddler unplugged the system from the electrical wall outlet and it was off for 24hrs.  I plugged the cord back in the wall and the current time and my settings started right back up.",5
"This shock collar set is not worth the price, or any price for that matter.  I have basically replaced every part of both collars, and they still both died.
The seller I used was very good about sending replacement parts, but that's where my praise stops.  I eventually gave up on these and threw them out.
Complete waste of resources, and they don't work on thick-haired dogs, even when they're fully functioning.
DO NOT BUY.",1
"If you have a quick eater and are debating which bowl to buy- buy this one.
I have tried others, which barely slowed my dog down. The other designs made by this company might work okay for some, but for my dog they would not work, they are too linear and easy to get food out of. I needed something difficult-- and the flower design is it. It's so perfect I've bought 2 of these!
She has a very hard time getting to every piece of food. I'm able to spoon her soft food into this (in small amounts). It makes it hard to clean, but between her being a glutton and a quick rinse in the sink before going in the dishwasher there are no problems.

I was initially worried that my dog would tip this bowl over and spill the food on the floor. Not only is she a glutton, she is smart! The base of this is wide, and has a sturdy rubber piece surrounding it that prevents that from happening. It's really well designed and perfect for he dog at risk for bloat!",5
Perfect size for our German Shepherd. Now if only we could get him to drop the ball on command...,5
"Our small dogs love these but they go thru them very quickly.  It seems to break down easier so I worry a bit less about choking however would never leave them alone with these or bully sticks. They prefer these over bully sticks, no smell or oily residue so safe for furniture or carpet.",4
"Well my crested boy isn't a huge fan, but thats not for lack of quality! He's just a fussy old man who doesn't like change. Would still recommend it though!",5
Dogs like it put was torn up quickly. Torn up or not they still play with it.,3
"I can't understand why heaters are so big. Not just this one, they're all huge. This is 25 watts. It's meant to go in a tank that's 5 gallons or less. Why does it have to be 8"" long and a giant eyesore in the back of my tank? Anyway, pet peeve of mine. Other than that, it works well and once I found the sweet spot on the thermostat, keeps my tank at an even 78 degrees.",4
"My pooch chows anything , bites hole in all the toys. this is the only one that she has not been able to destroy !!!",5
"It's really great to find a duck treat for my IBD cat, which is not easy to come by! He usually eats it, pill & all, saving me the hassle of manually pilling him. Too bad it's so darn expensive!",4
This impeller worked like a charm to quiet my 280B Emperor!,5
"Bright, beautiful light, and low profile appearance.  Very easy to install, too.",5
"I got this for my dog so she would have a specific place to go lay down (on command).  She likes hanging out in this spot generally ever since we got the cot.  But I trained her that when I say ""place,"" she hops up there and lays down.

This makes the cot indispensable when company comes to the door.  We were always so afraid she would run out in the commotion because she's tiny.  When someone knocks at the door, we just tell her ""place,"" and she jumps on the cot.  She looks pretty comfortable up there too!

Google ""place dog command"" to learn how to do this.  This cot is the perfect place to do that.",5
Best for the dog that can destroy any bone in an hour. These last.,5
It's attractive but did arrive with a crack in the wood.  I kept it anyway instead of having to pack it up and send it back.  The customer who said to tape a garbage bag against the back interior of the unit was correct.  I have a male cat and some overspray got on the back of the unit.,4
"Our pup is 100% addicted to this ball. However, I wish there were a version available without the squeaker, as it is a strong one!",5
"My three year old Maine Coon ""boy"" loves this toy. Hasn't stopped playing with it since Christmas day. However, I had to adjust the top to one hole and only part of that as the holes are large. If you have an active cat, you may wantt to give this a try.",5
"My cats are addicted to this stuff, it's bad for them but so are Dorritos for us.",5
Dog loves these.,5
"Seems to calm the dogs down a little bit but nothing too drastic.  They don't pass out or anything like that, they just don't freak out quite as badly when we leave, etc. The dogs also love them more than any other treat!",5
No tracking.  Clumps as well as anything else.  Good odor control.  I'm buying again.  Cheaper here than market,5
"These treats smell awful,  like vinegar.  Also, my chihuahua Sophie didn't like them at all, she wouldn't even try one.  However,  she absolutely loves the blissful banana crisps.",1
Didn't seem to help my dog much.  He has congestive heart failure and is on multiple meds already.  We were just looking for something to cut down the coughing in between doses of rx meds. Not really an appreciable improvement with this.,3
We absolutely LOVE this brush and ended up buying a second so we have one at both my home and my SO's! Our dogs have very different coats and this brush works great for both of them. One is extra fluffy and this pulls so much undercoat he gets almost silky to touch after! The other is a very fine short hair who still leaves trails all over and this actually pulls a bunch off of him where i am not constantly having to vaccuum daily. I HIGHLY recommend this brush and it is a great buy for the price.,5
It helped to keep the litter contained but my taller cat would not use it because it is better for smaller cats. Also if the room is not very bright some cats will not use it (too dark in the cave). I had to switch out to a traditional uncovered box.,2
Great boots!!!! Easy yo use and great comfort for my dog.,5
"These are working very well. My Male Lab. ""Bogy"" after Humphrey Bogart himself loves these and his coat is a shinny smooth soft to the touch feel. I love him so and love to give him kisses and hugs. Great product. Highly recommended. I just re-ordered.",5
"My 10-month-old puppy is a German Shepherd/Lab mix who always needs toys around, otherwise she gets into trouble. Can't buy her stuffing-less toys, because she swallows them whole; I like this brand, but when I buy her these toys (she's had, and destroyed, 5 of these animals just in the last two months) she pulls the guts out pretty quickly and then eventually swallows the pieces of fabric if we let her keep playing with the empty shell.

Poor Ellie only lasted a couple of hours. The cow lasted maybe 10 days, the piglets have each lasted maybe a month? Which was pretty amazing, and the ladybug lasted a couple of weeks. I bought a few at a time because they were cute, she liked the first one, and they are definitely more durable than some of the plush pet toys we've gotten her. Good size for a large dog breed, and the squeaker is buried so they really have to work at it. I like this brand but now I am wondering how she so quickly/methodically destroys them if they are ""tough"" toys. It's not gradual - it's all or nothing.

So...great, fun, soft, adorable toys...but I do wish it didn't seem like my dog could end these toys at the slightest whim. It feels like a waste of money to spend $30 on maybe three of these and a few weeks later have to reinvest.",3
"My GSD Busted Out of this 3mm Choker! I couldn't believe it. This was her 3rd one we bought to fit her as she grew and was happy with these chokers all along but never expected her to bust it chasing a critter one night. Maybe there 4mm would do the trick maybe it was a fluke it broke but my GDS is only 14 months old and a trim 70 lbs. So we wanted to play it safe we bought another brand a 6mm, this choker will tow a car. Its a bit bling bling but it's keeping my baby girl safe and thats all that matter.",3
Does what is expected. Thanks!,5
Dogs love this,5
"This stuff works for eliminating urine smell, leaves a fresh scent. It has not stopped my cat from urinating on my pantry floor though...",4
"These work so well for my 2 little Chihuahuas.  The price is the best price I've found.  We always keep a pad in the Iris FT-500 floor protection tray for those occasions we are unable to take our little doggies outside in bad weather, or when we leave them for long periods of time in the house alone during the day.  The pads hold a lot of moisture and on occasion when they are saturated and I fold them up for disposal, they do not leak.  If I could, I would rate them more than 5 stars.",5
"I would never buy anything else ever again. I was feeding my Labrador Retriever grain free products and she put on a lot of weight and had a lot of skin allergies. I decided to try the Nutro ultra weight management dry dog food and I mix it with Nutro ultra weight management canned food and senior food. I alternated them as there is not too much difference in the ingredients. She went from 109 pounds to 84 pounds, and her skin and coat have never looked better. Yes this dog food may cost a little bit more but it's totally worth it in what I'm saving from having to put her on steroids every time her skin flares up some some kind of a food allergy. Plus the extra weight she was carrying around was very hard on her arthritis and hip dysplasia which is very common in Labrador retrievers. I highly recommend this dog food. You won't be sorry you switched.",5
"They should call this the mini kong. Much smaller than anticipated. Good for a toy sized tea cup
dog.",2
"Good product, good service at a fair price.",5
Way to bog!,1
puppies love these and a great price for a huge container..seems to last forever,5
Item was as described in listing.,4
Tender favorites are shredded texture and savory morsels are bite-sized. Both with gravy. My cats liked both of these textures and the gravy.,5
Super cute; but my hamster completely ignored it.,4
"This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.

Cost
All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.

Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).

Smell
Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.

Taste
Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.

Poop
When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the ""Whole 30"" and see what I mean.

Switching to Grain Free
Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.

BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.",5
"10 bucks ,so at least it's not a 20-40 dollar toy, Definitely NOT ''INDESTRUCTIBLE''  not even a little......I have 2 Malinois and they are ''DESTROYERS''  most great made toys will last 5-20 minutes,,,,,The Goughnuts, ''new line of Guaranteed ,toys are holding up good, also Kong & that's about it,,,,EVERYTHING ealas the Malingerers ,  ''DESTROYER'' .....",2
"These are great dog beds because they can easily be washed.  I started out with about 5 of the small pads, while my two pugs were small and soiled their beds a lot.  I could fit 4 or 5 of these pads in my washer machine at one time!  After a month, my pugs settled down and are now getting along better, so they now sleep together on one medium-sized bed (I removed the separate crates).  I have two of the medium sized beds.  I can easily wash one or both in my washing machine. Very practical.",5
My cats love this.,5
Got a great deal here!  Can't go wrong with Flexi brand.  Used it for months now and very happy with my purchase.,5
"Yes, it's quiet. But, wasn't at all impressed with it's performance. Tried it on my dogs. Didn't seem shorten the nails very effectively. Tried it on myself. Left my nail very rough. Disappointed. Thought it might be the answer to keeping dogs' nails trimmed without going to a groomer or to the vet (both rather expensive)",2
very good price and an unbeatable value compared to stores...plus I love that they degrade over time,5
I like this product.,5
Good product.  This was prescribed by a veterinarian for my golden retriever with allergies to be used twice weekly. He was also prescribed a special diet. This shampoo lathers pretty good and gets him clean and helps with secondary skin infections. After lathering up completely it should be left on at least 10 minutes before rinsing. It just gets a little expensive bathing a large dog. No more expensive than similar shampoos.,5
"Edited on 10/23/17: all alive

Exactly as described. There are enough reviews on here for you to make an informed decision. I highly recommend you make an informed/educated decision so that you don't regret or feel ashamed for your purchase in the future.  I myself am quite happy.  It (large egg) is exactly as described and what I wanted.

 I will update at the one year mark for alive or dead animal.

I personally went with FedEx one day shipping. I would assume that is the best route and that is what I may suggest however there really is no concrete answer.",5
"Might be nice for a baby but not dog.  I bought several of these in different colors and gave them as rewards over a spaced period of time.  Within minutes of initial joy at receiving a new toy, the stuffing flies.",1
Will work great when time to clean my sunsun filter hoses.,5
"my cat wouldn't go near this stuff ... no matter how many times I tried to introduce the product(s) to him.  I now just use a regular tooth brush with a slightly pointed brush head.  he's not always cooperative with the regular brush, but at least it's much better than this kit.  don't waste your money.",1
"Extremely super disappointed in these, very sorry i bought them, trust me these are loud, very loud, and for the size you cant add anything like purigen to the media compartment, and as for the bio wheels they don't worth crap, all they do is produce thousands of micro bubbles and make your aquarium look like it has little particles floating about, would never recommend them, already removed them and replaced them with 2 Seachem Tidal 75s, will see how they work out, but o my GOD they are quiet, if you don't see the water moving you would think they are not running.",1
"My cat is fairly picky with treats. She also was going through a phase of not being able to digest her food well. After seeing the vet and things checking out okay, we bought a package of Pet Greens treats to see if having more greens in her diet would help. They definitely have helped. Our cat also loves them, which is good. Now I make sure to keep a package on hand for when she wants a treat.",5
"My dog was not a fan. She sniffed it once and ignored it the rest of the time. It was a waste, but interesting to look at.",2
"We didn't have a huge flea/tick problem but I was seeing a few ticks and a few fleas on 2 of my 3 dogs every few days. That was too many for me but I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars getting the house sprayed by a professional. So, we tried this stuff and made sure to give all 3 of our dogs a flea/tick bath. Since we have done that and sprayed this stuff, I haven't seen any fleas or ticks.",5
"We wanted a cat tree that looks a little better than your average carpeted box, the Lotus cat tower is perfect in our more modern home. It's easy to put together, just make sure you put the correct shelf brackets on the correct levels and your set. It looks good and is made of nice stained plywood.",5
"Bought this replacement flap, as ours has taken a beating over the last 1.5 years or so when it was originally installed. Our old one was warped and let in heat and house flies. We have the Aluminum PetSafe door and this one was the exact replacement.",4
I wouldn't recommend buying from this seller again because I didn't get that big spray piece that I saw in the picture,4
This is a great dry dog food for my little Yorkie mixed with the beef roll she will eat both....,5
Cat did not like this bed.,1
"My golden retriever has had problems with limping in the past, but since I've been feeding him this brand, he's been up and running limp free.",5
Great product!,5
"It's a bit too large, almost as if it has stretched out.  Love the durability, colors and hardware.  Cannot tighten to accomodate stretching  due to rubber blueberry pet label.  Would buy a smaller size next time.",3
"This small warming mat that I use on my enclosed patio to keep my adult cats warm at night.  The metal wrapped cord is very ingenious and would be great for kittens.  This is my first purchase from this brand but I am happy with it because it seems like a quality product.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.  The product arrived on time, properly packaged, and in perfect condition.",5
My rats are loving these treats.,5
EXCELLENT - great size my little boston think its her condo,5
"I purchased 4 packs (I have 3 dogs). The items came in a bit late but still within the promissed time. However all 4 packs had gone bad. Inside each pack was an unrecognazable mass of black and rotten something that smelled rotten. I immediately threw away all of it, knowing I will lose the refund. But no one in the housrhold could handle the smell.",1
"The air controller is defective, loose tread and the air is coming out thru it.. the T only is somehow the other side have more air than the other. you have to check it always because sometimes no air is coming out, I thought my air pump is the problem but it I remove the controller it released powerful air but when I put on the controller I barely can't get the air out, have to push the controller knob in hard to get the out, but then after few hours have to do same thing again..",1
"This is awesome, and Ripley loves it. I only wish you made a larger one with sturdier construction on the log (maybe some kind of heavy canvas instead of plush) for large breeds, because she likes to chew at the seams of the stump when she's done extracting squirrels and hurling them around the room. I'm a little worried that she's going to rip it up someday, but it is holding up astonishingly well so far (I do swap her the stump for a different toy whenever she starts to pin it down to chew it rather than just shaking it vigorously).

The squirrels are REALLY durable - I am seriously impressed by how well they've been surviving. Ripley will occasionally carry them out to the yard and bury them in the snow to chill for a while before resuming play (she really likes putting cold stuff in her mouth), and they've been handling the combination of dampness and dog teeth and being flung into walls by my ridiculous pup very well. I'm thinking about buying some additional squirrels so it'll take her longer to empty the stump.

This is one of her top three favorite toys, and she will hunt it down and drag it out to play with if I put it away.",5
Great my dog loves them,5
"I had a smaller drinkwell for my cats and upgrading to this fountain was a great decision!  All of our animals now use this one (even though the cats still have their own) and it only needs to be filled a few times a week. I am very pleased with how quiet it is also.
Great product!",5
This was such a great find. I bought three for my three large dogs and couldn't be happier. They take up much less space than the combo food/water stands I had before. I highly recommend these elevated dog dishes.,5
"This toy is tough as nails and the perfect size for a large dog (70-100 pounds).  Within minutes of setting this on the floor, it was picked up and my dogs were romping around the house hosting a joyous ""squeak party"".  They both took some time running around with it and even had a brief but vigorous tug-o-war.  None of this made even a slight mark on the toy.

The construction is double seamed and things like eyeballs are not protruding so they don't create an obvious target for the dogs to use to tear it apart.  I've had other Kyjen toys that have lasted for years (and the squeakers still work, and they aren't torn).  In general, they are very well built (though I have found one exception, reviewed elsewhere).  Generally speaking, I look for these toys by name and have confidence that I'm not wasting money on a destroyed toy.",5
"Snake oil.  Put it in their food.  Sprayed it on her body.  Dropped it on her neck.  I've even, unfortunately, sprayed my cat in the face.  THAT was a mistake. I didn't mean to do that.  She was seriously going after my other cat and I wasn't thinking.  Nothing.",1
Bought the large table to groom a standard poodle.  Table is sturdy-its not overly heavy to tote- but doesn't wobble and holds dog fine.  For a simple at home table and at the price compared to others its worth it.,5
The dog loves these. They are softer than a tennis ball so it is much better on their months.,5
I got these to train my puppy when he was about 10 weeks old.  He picked up on it after two days. He now rings the bells whenever he needs to go out (potty breaks and to just play).  I bring them to friends houses and he uses them there too.  Great for dogs that won't whine or bark to go out.,5
Works amazing! Worth the money.,5
"My dog loves any toy, it's was even more awesome when I install a large squeaker",5
One of my small Terriers was constantly scratching his ears.  I decided to switch food and this seems to have stopped his scratching.,5
Bought this just a few months ago and wish I had bought it when I got the fountain! I was having to add water daily to the fountain (with 2 cats using it) and several times was awoken in the middle of the night by the pump running low. Now I fill the reservoir with ice cubes about every 3 days and that's enough for my two. The ice gives them some cool water on the first day and also lessens the chance of water leaking out when inverting to place on the base.,5
My dog eats this food better than any tried.,5
Seemed to work the first time. After that its effect was not so noticeable.,3
My dog loves this and I know he's getting a healthy meal! I ordered the subscription.,4
"This is a great product that fixed my cat's UT problem. I had been traveling a lot last summer, and feeding the cats dry food with auto feeders. One cat got a little fat and developed a urinary tract irritation and his urine got too alkaline. This lowers the urinary ph, problem solved. No vet bills.",5
"Yes, they are soft and adorable.  I bought two of these for each pup.  They do get dirty and stretched out pretty fast, though.  I will say 3 weeks for my girl pup and 8 for my boy pup before these were shredded.  I do put both my pups in harnesses rather than collars all of the time and I did like that the harness was soft and comfy.  Out of all the harnesses I have gotten my pups, these were the most attractive, just not quite sturdy enough.  I didn't even walk them in these harnesses because they looked as if they were going to fall apart the whole walk.  Maybe they would be great for a smaller dog that doesn't chew or pull much.  My 50 pound labs were just too much for the Planet dog harness.",3
"It's okay. I really can't justify the price, especially the supposed original price that is slashed off.......",3
My Pitt loves to fetch squeaker toys but he destroys all toys,4
"Unfortunately, my cat did not like this product.  She happens to be a very fussy eater.  It looks great so I recommend it for people whose cats are less fussy.",2
"This is the best dog food out there. My corgi puppy is super healthy, he doesn't over eat nor is he food obsessed as many corgwyn can be. The 15lb bag lasts us a little over a month.",5
Works great for the price.,5
Great quality dog food. It is delivered on time every order. My puppy is healthy and her coat is fluffy and shines,5
this is basically a glorified pull top bag that slips over a belt. Would be awesoem except i don't wear a belt and it doesnt work well on the hem of my pants.,4
"I cannot complain complain much about this diaper. It is the only one my dog keeps on.  She cannot wear the disposable diapers because the minute she sits I hear the cheap velcro ripping off.  With these, they stay put.  With the exception that she did manage to rip one off one night.

The only down side for these is the fact that they are not as thick as one would like.  You can see the fluid on the heavy days, but I usually place one of the Always infinity pads on and that usually does the trick. If you own a lab buy X-large! Fits perfect!",4
Works great for keeping fleas and ticks away and it softens the coat and even smells good. Follow instructions as it can be strong/RINSE VERY WELL. No problems with use on my German Shepherd dog during the HOT summer months. I use natural products other months.,5
The squirrels are obsessed with this feeder. they enter one hole and lay their entire bodies over the food while their head is buried in it near the other opening. Very cute to watch. Some of the squirrels have scratched/chewed this a lot in some places though,5
I can actually walk my dog (who likes to explore and is unmindful of the person at the end of her leash) now!,5
"I have had two more of these fountains and they are great.

So much better than the Cats sitting in the sink and waiting by the faucet looking for running water or drips.

Little to no problems with the fountains over 2 years.

No leaks, drips or puddles on the floor

I had one power supply die after 2 years of continuous use but even with that problem I highly recommend  the product.

A side benefit is it very intriguing and a constant source of interest for my 2 Girls.",5
"Originally our vet put one of our senior cats on this supplement because of a poor appetite.  So we sprinkled this powder on his breakfast and supper meals as directed.  He immediately developed a new interest in his food, as did our other senior cat, so we included her.  A probiotic is to be good for the gut and for immunity, so we are happy to have this product and will continue to use it for their health.",5
"I bought this for my cat box she wasn't going in her regular one after the move, and she actually loves it. Worked out great!",5
"My dogs love this, good quality of dog food and amazing price.",5
Good quality. My cat likes it. He is very picky. He gets this as a snack. He eats canned food at his meals. A small scoop of this in between is enough to keep him from begging for food.,5
nice size,5
Suction cup not so good!  Other wise great product,4
It is light weight and does not take up a lot of space.  I have yet to be able to fold it down . Yes I do recommend.,4
"Works okay, no issues",4
Like the color combination. But it is not thick enough than I was hoping for.,3
"So, the fish is my chocolate lab's favorite new toy.  Only three stars because the squeaker died after about a week, the fish itself is still intact and she still plays with it.",3
My Labradoole has hairy ears.  In the summer his ears often get wet from swimming.  Sometimes even back from grooming there are more hairs than I like.  This powder makes the issue manageable.  Highly recommend.,5
"Arrived on time, worked great for grooming mats out of mycat.",5
"awful. I almost threw up when I opened it, my cat had the same thoughts. What a waste",1
"It's dusty and the urine smell becomes strong after a week or so, even with daily scooping.",3
My cat is absolutely obsessed. He shreds them to bits which is why I've decided to order the multi pack.,5
I looked for these replacement cartridges and found what I needed at a good price.  Perfect for the Cat Mate fountain model that I have.,5
They love it they dig down in it and only come out at night,5
"Great leash for jogging with your dog, very strong and trustworthy. A must for the outdoorsman that requires a leash",5
"I tried hard to get my 6 cats interested in this catnip......I offered it to them to chew, I sprinkled it on their play gym, I even rubbed some on their paws. Out of 6 cats, only 2 were remotely interested! The other 4 could hardly be bothered to lift their heads to investigate it. I don't know why they have literally turned their noses up at it - they have loved other brands of catnip in the past. But this one - it's a no-go. Two stars for the two cats who were half interested and at least batted the crinkle ball toy around for a minute or two!! Now what do I do with the full container of catnip?!! Pics = disinterested kitties.",2
"My golden retriever is prone to ear problems. Any morning she wakes up shaking her head and pawing at her ears, I put a squirt in each ear and within minutes she acts fine. She does not like having her ears touched prior to the solution doing its job. After a few minutes, though, can pet her ears without her growling at me.",5
My dogs just love these treats,5
Not smell. Super hard.  Pups aren't impressed,4
"As other types of this brand, my cats love them all.",5
"Only brand I buy, good product, great value, good service!!",5
"Because it's in sections, have to be careful not to mix up sections when cutting to size. Slightly flimsy but adequate. Have to know what you're doing when cutting screws to size.",3
"We love this aquarium, however the lights have quit working....HELP!!!!",4
Both dogs were amused and they may be when we let them play with it outside. They just don't play with it after the first day when it arrived.,3
"I buy these for my pug that is on a grain free diet. When you switch your pup to grain free you change their internal Ph and can cause them to have issues like crystals in their urine, kidneys, UTI's, etc. So one of the things that we found that help counterbalance the increased Ph are these pills. We give 2 in the AM and PM with meals. No problems with her taking them and I've noticed that her urine is not as dark. We go back for testing every couple of months to make sure that they are still working in her urine and that there aren't any more crystals building in her urine. I would defintely recommend these and also work with your vet to make sure these are optimal for YOUR pet",5
This is the only piece of furniture we've ever bought for our cat that she actually uses.  We had a junky one before that fell apart after only a few months.  We've had this one now for over a year and it's as if its brand new (except the addition of cat hairs).  This one is standing the test of time and is so easy to clean.  We absolutely love this enough we're probably going to get another one for our bedroom.,5
Cleaning this fountain isn't an easy task but my dog loves the constant flow of water.,4
"Works great, but doesnt seem to scan Home Again chips, which most of my dogs have. I am a dog breeder and I got it to have on hand for strays or rescue animals. Not sure why it doesnt scan Home Again. They are 10digit chips.",4
Perfect for a Boxer,5
"My cat doesn't seem to care for it much, but he's eating it",3
"I LOVE this filter. The media that comes with it is great but the best part is that you can really put anything in it. The adjustable flow rate is very handy. In the beginning it was a little noisy, but after a week it was practically silent. I think you have to let the slime coat build up around the impeller and then it runs super smooth. I did a lot of research on what filter I wanted and in the end I think this is the best quality and value for a HOB filter. You are not ""locked in"" to their media (which is also reasonably priced if you choose to stick with it). I no longer have to invest in the money pit that is replacement filter cartridges. I personally found some reusable filter bags (nylon stockings work too) and buy my carbon/ammonia chips/other media in bulk, saving tons. Along with the 20g version, I've also bought the 50g and 70g. I've never had a problem with them. I've unplugged them and had them re-prime with no problem. I truly highly recommend these filters.",5
I used it for 1 month my dog's ears cleared up.  Be sure to do it out side it is messy. The cap was a little confusing.,5
"My dog refused to eat it, something she has never done with other foods in her 6 1/2 years.",1
"I haven't tasted it myself, but my cats seem to love it. The pate is less messy then the bits with gravy.",5
"Dog loved it! My dog is a mild chewer, not too heavy, but definitely enjoys a good bone. I took this particular bone with us to TopGolf to distract my dog while we played. He was attracted to the scent before handing it over, and when we finally gave it to him he devoured it rapidly. Absolutely loved it!

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I tend to believe that it should be longer lasting than a few minutes, especially given the fact that its a massive bone in terms of size and my dog isn't a super heavy chewer. Either way, would recommend this product and purchase again!",4
Works good,5
My kittens favorite snack.,5
"I loved it, but to big for my parakeets. I know someone getting a cockatiel so it will be perfect for that bird. I loved the concept, just need smaller for parakeets.",5
I have 4 cats and every morning I would find a new hair ball. It was summertime so I am sure they were shedding more the usual... But I also never seen them have so many! I started mixing this in wet food every couple days and I only had to clean up a couple after I started giving them doses of this! I recommend!,5
"So far, I really like the harness and so does my dog a 55lb, German Sheperd. It's very quick and easy to get on and off, both the dog and I appreciate that. ",5
high quality,5
Love it you can hook it on your pants loop and don't have to worry about taking a bag with you such a good idea,5
These were bigger than I expected about the size of an orange. My conure loves playing with them and pulling the paper out. We were able to buy replacement paper at our local bird store so that's really nice. They also fit conveniently on his bird condo window!,5
"So I bought this because I usually like PetSafe toys and this looked like it would keep my dogs busy. The premise looks simple enough, put a dog biscuit in, and they work to get them out. But, no matter which size of biscuit I put in, the dog just bite them off at the edge of the toy, and the rest of the biscuit gets stuck inside until I push it out for them. Ah well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.",2
I love it.  The cats seem to be able to empty it with no problem and I find it washes up very well.,5
"I like this collar. I have a stubborn boxer mix and it does what it says. The only thing the collar that comes with the unit does not stay on, it slides off to easy. I used an old collar that is thicker plastic and it stays on. If the company could change the web collar it would get 5 stars.",4
Cute,5
DOG HANZ EATS THESE WITH GUSTO,4
"I have four adult cats and they adore this cat tree.  It was a Christmas gift for them and they actually fight over the perch and the box with the hole in the top.  I measured mine and it is 45"" high by 44"" wide (from one bottom stabilizer base corner to the other). I am very pleased with my purchase. It was an inexpensive cat tree so I didn't expect it to be of the top quality materials you would find for $150 - $200 at the pet store.  However, this cat tree is worth way more than the $60 I spent for it.  The differences between this and the $200 74"" cat tree I already have are minimal.  In fact, the carpet covering on this one is of better quality than on my more expensive one.  Assembly was exactly the same, as are the materials it is made out of (with the exception of the aforementioned carpet). This one is just a little less stable but that is due to the design, not a quality issue.  The base of my larger cat tree is very wide and thus it is more stable.  This is two narrow bases hooked together by a scratching ramp - what does one expect?

I love this product and definitely intend to purchase more cat trees from this vendor.  My cats are 9, 3, 2, and 1 respectively and they all are able to fit in and use all of the features of this cat tree.  You can't beat the price for the quality of this product.",5
"Our 7 year boxer's coat was looking somewhat dull and he was shedding a lot.  Since
we started giving them to him each morning (3), his coat is shiny and the shedding has
reduced immensely.  I puncture the capsule with the tip of a wine openerand squeeze
them all over his kibble each morning, along with a probiotic.  He can hear me prepping
his breakfast and he charges into thekitchen and licks the bowl clean....
HE LOVES THIS SUPPLEMENT.  He hasn't relished his food like this, ever!
Thanks for a great product, Nordic Naturals!!!",5
Smaller bottle than at the farm store but this might be the new size this year. Same product as always.,3
Both of my dogs responded so well to this product!  I was able to take one off prescription meds and she is walking better with this!,5
"My dogs love them enough that they perform tricks for these bully sticks, and they don't stink or stain the carpet. We're all very happy.",5
Came broken but I did find them in the store and my dog loves it,3
Don't get me started on this toy! I could go on forever at it being the best cat toy ever (once attached)  My cats go wild so I must keep additional refills on hand!,5
"As previous reviewers have noted, this is a perfect home for a single betta. It's my understanding that the filtration system for the Marineland Explorer, a two-gallon setup, is too powerful for a betta, but is fine (it's the same unit) in this tank--no stressful ""riding the rapids,"" just a pristine environment, populated with beneficial bacteria, that requires only a weekly partial water change and a monthly cartridge replacement rather than the frequent complete changes necessitated by the lack of a filter (just to play it safe, though, I cover the intake tube with coarse nylon mesh to ensure that long fins don't accidentally get sucked in and torn).
This little tank sat empty for several years; it was purchased with a betta in mind, but I realized that between-seasons heating in my apartment is too iffy for an unheated tank. At that time, the smallest available heaters were 50 W models--way too powerful for a three-gallon tank. I recently discovered, however, that 25 W models with reliable thermostats are now available, so there's no reason why anyone shouldn't be able to house a betta safely and comfortably all year 'round. According to user reviews, the two best models seem to be Marineland's own Stealth and the Theo by Hydor--both are Italian-made, are completely submersible, and are available on Amazon through third-party sellers. I have one of each (although I haven't needed them yet); my suggestion would be to go with the Stealth because it's made of plastic rather than glass and carries a lifetime guarantee (the Theo's is two years).
This tank's only minus is the feeding area--it's much too small and is nearly inaccessible, even for someone like me who has very small hands and long, slender fingers. I can only imagine what a pain it is for an adult whose hands are of more average size. It's also too easy to miss the water surface, hitting instead the plastic brace that supports the filtration system (lots of fun with bloodworms). It's a minor, but very irritating, design flaw.
With a little gravel (1/4"" or so), a cave (I found a perfect one on Aquabid), a Java fern (which Petco markets as ""'Tropica' Fern""), some Java moss, a thermometer, and a free-floating plant like gymnocoronis for lounging and algae control (bettas love plants but please, NO plastic--real or silk only) you're good to go. Forget gimmicky items--including the ones manufactured by Marineland--such as bowls, cubes, ""hexes,"" vases, etc. Bettas are shallow-water fish, best served with longer rather than deeper tanks with easy access to the surface. Owners, on the other hand, dislike maintenance. The Eclipse System Three strikes a perfect balance between both parties. Highly recommended for families (except those whose members include obsessive, troll-like, liver-lipped Ugly Boys from Finland).",5
"The cat takes his pills willingly.  Since he has no teeth, I use only 1/2 a pocket per pill and form it around the pill.  They are soft so this works fine.  With the free shipping, the price here is less than the local pet shop.",5
my fur baby really like the taste of the paste but does not like the shape of the tooth brush.  Will purchase another brush elsewhere,4
They liked it!,5
The scoop part of this set is really large. I like it,5
We definitely wanted something with as low an environmental impact as possible (while still curbing our dog in the city).  This does the trick and looks cute on his leash.,5
"This is a very neat little toy. My cat doesn't show much interest in it, but she does on occasion attack it. usually at 2 a.m.!  As long as she's happy. Shipped quickly. A friend on mine said that this would be a cool toy for toddlers too.",4
These are amazing and arevworking well for our dog with kd. My only complaint is that in the few short weeks since I first ordered the price has doubled and I was planning to purchase more so I am slightly disappointed ,5
these are the exact ones that fit my daughters fishtank and they arrived so fast i love how the price is perfect and you can buy in bulk so you do not have to run to the store before you clean the tank.,5
"This jacket fits great and is well made. I have a 13 pound Miniature Pinscher that has a 12"" back 18"" chest and the extra small fits him great. It is much thicker than I expected which is a plus.

The only downside, which I've seen a lot of other people write about, is that the velcro strap across the stomach is in a bad spot for male dogs. I will have to cut about an inch off and sew it. I also need to cut and sew a hole in the back for the harness the poke through. These are the two reasons that I am only giving 4 stars.",4
good,4
Great item CAT LOVES THEM,5
Milk Bones are Milk Bones. Dogs love them.  Decent price. But nearly 30 days for delivery is ridiculous.  Better off going to Kroger when you need them.,1
"Goal for next year: negotiate a raise simply because ""my dog needs more Stella & Chewy's""

The price of these patties is, well, insane. It was initially not my choice to feed my dog this (I'm way too frugal for that), however, my family kindly watched my dog while I had to leave the country for some time and they got him hooked. I was horrified when I learned about this, but they justified it in an interesting way - as insurance. (Feed the dog well now, less problems in the future - hopefully). They told me their biggest regret was feeding their two dogs grocery store junk and watching them suffer later in life.

Novella aside, I'm hoping they're correct. This is definitely good eating. My dog goes crazy for the patties in almost every flavour. I've hit on a few bags with some poor quality control over the years, but Stella & Chewy's always pulls through when I let them know. They seem to be a great company that's actually focused on their four-legged customers.

The patties are also very versatile - you can toss one as a treat, crumble them, soak them in water, or mix them with some kibble. I alternate. Just make sure to wash your hands afterward! I've happened to get violently ill a couple times since feeding by dog these patties, and I'm almost 100% sure it was due to being sloppy after feeding him. (These ARE raw meat at the end of the day, so be careful.)

Until I go broke, my pooch will be eating these.",5
"This liquid formula is so much easier to apply than the solid. It absorbs and conditions the leather, making it more supple and resistant to damage. It isn't as waterproofing as the solid, but even the solid allows moisture in. The perk with the liquid is that the leather dries more quickly than if it was coated in solid mink oil. I've been using this mink oil liquid for a couple years now and the ease of application motivates me to take more frequent care of my leathers. A few months ago, a friend brought me a an old 1990s tool scabbard that belonged to her late husband. It was severely dessicated and rock hard with no give. It took me several applications of this mink oil inside and out to rehydrate the leather. Once done, it was just gorgeous and ready to form to her tools. Miracles are possible with enough elbow grease and liquid mink oil.",5
My kitten loved this toy. Although it's a bit smaller then what I was looking for it worked for us.,5
Great little balls that one of my cats love carrying around in her mouth.,5
My beardy doesnt use it yet but it works as advertised,5
"My dog has colitis and it causes all sorts of issues for him. This is the one probiotic that has always worked well for him. When he's having a flare-up, I double the dose and he's usually good.",5
Good quality material and construction. Exerts gentle pressure. Easy to slip on to go for a walk but I would not leave it on since it could snag on something.,5
Thank you,5
This is my kitten's favorite toy! A must-have for felines of all ages!,5
"Fits well, nice color, easy to adjust, durable.",5
Cat never played with them.,3
The harness is really easy for them to slip out of.,3
Works wonders.,5
"A dear friend sent these to my dogs as a gift.  Both of my dogs (a lab mix and a pug/chihuahua mix) both thoroughly enjoy these Fruitables.  With the lab, all I have to do is pick up the bag.  I don't know how she knows, even before I open the bag, but she knows (even if she's in another room).  She'll wiggle, jump, shiver and shake until she's had her daily Fruitables.  I can hardly wait to try the other flavors.  I really like that this are all natural and healthy for my pets.",5
"I bought these to go in the Busy Buddy Twist N Treat dog toy.. He likes the taste, but he can't seem to manuver the toy.. He's a dachshund and I think his little legs can't manuver it very well. So basically, these aren't working the way we wanted them to, but he does like the taste of them.",5
I see a difference in my dogs coat already - it's more shiny and soft. I just wish it was regulated by the FDA.,4
It's pretty hard to pick up poo - it was fine in the winter when the poo is frozen and does smush - but definitely not user friendly with warm weather. I resorted back to picking up the yard with a old fashioned plastic bag. Bummer!,3
"My cat is not thrilled with these.  She will eat them, but i cut them in half as they are too large for her",3
"Okay, it seems a little silly to review dog poop bags, but these are great! They are strong, a good size, and easy to use. I find  grocery store bags a bit cumbersome for this task, so it's worth spending a couple of bucks on these. I'm about halfway through the box and haven't had a single bad bag. They are unscented, but are dusted with some cornstarch, which makes them easy to separate.

I was going to say that I would have preferred they be on some type of roll in a dispenser-style box, but not having to tear them off on one another means that you're less likely to damage them before use. And no one wants to use a dog poop bag with a hole in it. Eww!

This product is made in China.",5
My bun positively  lives  for his bedtime treat! He thinks these are the best ever!  He's a little chucky so I cut them in thirds and he go's nuts for them!,5
DOGS SAY YUMMY,5
Had to return it as it was too small for the Honda Element.  Guess it might have worked for other cars?,3
"This is a really strong heavy weight collar.  It really helps getting my very strong giant breed puppy under control.  However, she has long hair and it got stuck in the prongs.  I had to cut some of her hair to get this collar off.  I understand that someone makes a quick release pronged collar, and I will try to find that one.  In the meantime, I would recommend this collar to anyone who has a large SHORT HAIR dog with training challenges.",4
Wonderful product!  my dog just loves this!,5
"People stop me all the time to ask where I bought these - great quality, very luminous without overpowering, rechargeable cable is very convenient. Holds a nice long charge for an 1.5hr walk, never been stranded yet.",5
"This item was ordered back in May for our 4 month old Beagle puppy, and delivered promptly.  Can't believe the cheap quality and how flimsy it is!!!  I had read all of the reviews, most of which were negative, but decided to try it for Jack, who uses any|everything he gets ahold of, to chew and bite on, some of which he tears to pieces!  Immediately stuck this teething ""stick"" in the freezer, which changed nothing about it as far as becoming hard from being frozen.  Jack picked it up, mouthed it a bit, then left it in the floor, never to return again... zero interest!  How could something so flimsy made from cotton (if that) material even be named a ""Teething Stick""?  There is not one feature about this rag toy that even remotely resembles a teething toy OR a toy, for that matter!  My beagle pup will play with almost anything at all, yet he dropped this one immediately as if I'd given him a hair bow or something similar!  No.... wait--- a hair ribbon or barrette would've been interesting for him to chew and destroy....

How any pet toy manufacturer could, in good conscience, sell something for $5.00 that is WORTHLESS to a teething puppy, is beyond me.  I feel that every single person who indeed paid 5 bucks for such a useless piece of cloth, should be refunded $5 each without having to return it.... due to time constraints due to illness in the family, I never had the chance to ship it right back.  I still believe that my verified purchase should be credited to my Amazon account.  As well as all the people who had negative reviews of this piece of crap ""teething stick"" that will not even freeze!!!  Very,  very disappointed and shocked to receive something so poorly made!!  You owe each of us $5",1
buy all time. great product.,5
my cat really likes these,5
Cats WILL NOT get in- I think it's great- they hate it.,2
"It chirps and even lands upright. The cats, and dogs love it.",5
My dog does not like this product or the vitamins from the ActiPet I think there must be some ingredient in them that he does not care for the smell or taste of. BUT every dog is different there may be some that love them.,2
Wow! Never thought to try one of these since I haven't seen too many in use. Its like I have a new dog. A perfect dog. My puppy is 115 lbs at almost 10 months. He ripped my arm and shoulder off trying to play with other dogs. Not with this. Perfect angel. Seriously. How did I not use this on my 2 rotties prior? Only thing he hates is the feeling on his face. He walks up to strangers and rubs his face. They think its cute but the older and unstable strangers are the problem. He knocks them over rubbing his face if I don't keep him away. Otherwise its a magic wand. Instant perfect puppy!,5
"I got this to feed my cats while I was out of town and kept using it to put them on a diet. I like the flexibility, but there is a design flaw. What I discovered is that the impeller that dispenses the food tends to jam up. One time it did it b/c of food in the edge of the impeller. The other time it seemed to jam up in the motor that drives it. If you're at home and monitor the device it would be O.K., but you wouldn't want to leave town for longer than you were willing to starve your cat(s).",2
"The pills work as stated. Star point deduction for how easily they crumble. Also, tabs like these should be able to be split for dogs who won't accept or ingest large tablets.",4
"I love these treats, and as many reviews have stated, it's nice that my dog can have a biscuit, even though he has kidney disease.  I've been giving him these as treats for at least 6 months, and his kidney levels are in normal range.  The biggest flaw with this treats is that the last 4 boxes I have purchased have many, many broken pieces at the bottom of the bag.  I think the company needs to look into packaging that will ensure nearly 1/8 of the biscuits are not reduced to kibble size.",5
"Work very well, functionality indistinguishable from original filters in everything but price, very pleased. I worried they might be thinner or poorly made, but have been durable, lasted well, and look nice. Great filters, exceptional value!",5
"dog likes it, good price point, quality ingredients.",4
"I will never buy any other kind of balls for our dogs. They absolutely love these things, and I've never had one get chewed up. We only throw them out when they've gotten to worn and weathered from being left outside when the boys sneak them past us, but even then they lasted well over a year. The handles that go with these are perfect for my wife who has a harder time getting distance on the ball when our Boston really wants to run around.",5
Works great!,5
"we have been buying this for about 3 years, great product fish gobble it up.",5
cats do like this flavor and always beg for it whenever we are near the cupboard where they are kept.,4
"It's too early to see if these work, but I'm very impressed with the maker and his dedication to his product. My little dog suffers from disc problems and luxating patellas. The vet's treatment of steroids is something I don't want to continue. My girl is very picky, but she likes these chews. They are similar in appearance and texture to heartworm chews and they must taste good. Half the battle is offering something she will take without wrapping it in cheese or peanut butter. The company is super supportive and interested in your dog's progress.",5
Good price.,5
My dog loves these.  I cut them up into much smaller pieces and they last a long time.,5
"This is super cute!  My daughter got one and also got one for my mom...they both loved them and so did their dogs :)  I would think it would be perfect for any dog who likes to cuddle in, or really likes their doggy bed.  The color is gorgeous, it really looks just like the picture.  I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.",5
"the come apart far too easily. I wanted to use them for a craft, but the folded rubber band kept getting undone and the bow itself wasn't knotted tight enough.",1
Tastes good,5
ok,4
not a toy for hard chewers,5
"I've fed Natural Balance canned food to my cats over the years and it's provided good nutrition for them.  Not the cheapest and certainly not the priciest I have found that my kitties are becoming more finicky in their older age (probably losing a bit of the sense of smell) and won't eat food unless it seems to have a strong odor.  This goes for most of the 6.

I transitioned from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Balance-Canned-Cat-Food-Indoor-Formula-24-x-6-Ounce-Pack/dp/B0018CFN2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Balance Canned Cat Food, Indoor Formula, 24 x 6 Ounce Pack</a>&nbsp;to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Balance-Canned-Cat-Food-Turkey-and-Giblets-Recipe-24-x-6-Ounce-Pack/dp/B0018CLGOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Balance Canned Cat Food, Turkey and Giblets Recipe, 24 x 6 Ounce Pack</a>&nbsp;and now to this variety.  It seems that they enjoy this fishy concoction best but DEFINITELY not as much as the Fancy Feast or now Sheba which has a lot of gravy in the can and is much softer.  I find that my cats gobble the latter food up!!!

I've been feeding premium and RX brands to our kitties for the past 10 years and honestly have not seen a huge return.  I have one cat that is prone to urinary blockages and the most important thing is to maintain a good feline urinary diet for him.  I have been feeding him an RX dry food diet supplemented with wet food of various varieties including this one.

This can is not as fishy smelling as some of the cheaper stuff ... I think it's why they gravitate to the cheaper brands and gobble it up.  I do a little mixing to make things more appealing at times.

Overall, I've been happy with Natural Balance but over the years I think that my cats have gotten a bit bored with it.  Now that I have introduced Sheba and Fancy Feast into their diets - they go nuts.  For me, it's a matter of changing things up every now and then.",4
"Best ""high value"" treat ever. Real cheese, just dehydrated. Break into morsels (they ship as pieces about the size and shape of a domino game piece) and pups will stand on hind legs and whistle Dixie if you want!",5
Love these pads.,5
Just what I wanted.,5
"I chose 4 stars because the steps slant downward.  Our 10 pound Shih Tzu can be coaxed up but is afraid to go down them after throwing her off balance the first time.  The product is well made, easy to assemble and delivery was right on time.",4
Just as described! I love it! Enough space to put everything my dog needs to wear on one tag! Highly recommend! This is sooooo pretty! My little princess looks even more like a princess!,5
I have been giving this to my 4 little dogs (Yorkies and Pekes ) for a few years! Started with one Yorkie that lost muscle mass when diagnosed with Cushings. He is back to being strong and healthy (along with his meds) and now all of them get 1/2 pill a day and are all very healthy.,5
"This product is all around great, it even smells fresh and delicious when i open the bag. But my bunny doesnt seem to fond of it. I think its bc when i adopted her they had her on some crap with cornmeal and soybean as first ingredients, within the first week of getting her this finally came in the mail and thats when i slowly switched over. Im hoping she will start getting use to it",4
"I love this stuff, it has a great fragrance. With 2 dogs and training a new puppy it has kept my home odor free.",5
Not ideal for strong chewers,3
"These pads are on the thin side and i have to change them more often. Sometimes i come home from work late and the pad is really full, but i have never seen it leak through. So they are ok for what you pay for them.",4
"This is super easy to set up, my toy American Eskimo and Yorkie have plenty of room to lay in it comfortably. We don't use it for travel but nightly crating.",5
my 4 month old kitty loves these.,5
"My lab loves this bone.  He prefers it significantly to his nylabones.  The shape is great also he king of holds it between his paws and is able to chew on different parts of it.  I would highly recommend.  He does seem to chew this up a bit quicker than his nylabone, but I attribute this to the fact that he just uses it more.",5
"My pug is an avid squeaker toy lover. He loves to squeak and shake his toys, ultimately ripping to remove squeakers. This toy has become his quick favorite as he also likes to suckle and the tentacles portion of toy provide that joy without any ripping. Of course if it's pulled hard enough like tug of war, it will rip off from body of toy.  Great toy overall!",5
This works well for my kitties. I have to add Miralax to one cat's food and it mixes pretty easily with a little water. Both of my cats eat this very happily and leave nothing behind.,5
Our St. Bernard loved them! They smelled delicious!,5
Dog likes these.  Satisfies her need to chew.  But more than two or three per week will upset her stomach.,5
"Great size (larger than some competitors), love that they're unscented.  Also, they're easier than other bags I've used-they're perforated well so you don't rip the bags when you're pulling one off.  They're also not 'dusty' like other bags can be.  And they're durable-haven't had any issues with them ripping or holes.",5
just changed my dog's food to this ... it has more protein & she likes it!,5
"It's a good product, and my guinea pigs loved it (as did my hamsters and mice). But I think the quality control is lacking. I found a feather in 1 of the 2 bags I ordered. Very disappointed, as I don't feel like I can feed that bag to my animals because birds often have mites

Update: I got a replacement bag, and there was a rock in it!!!!",1
"I have a Jack Russell Terror, oh I mean Terrier. This collar; size medium fits perfectly. I walk a lot at night and wanted something a bit reflective.  This collar reflects headlights and flashes from the camera as intended. Collar is made with superior material as Cosmo is a puller at times  (like when he sees rabbits) and the collar has stayed intact.  Will buy Rogz products again.",5
"I bought this treat holder because I liked the easy and quick access to treats while working with my dog.  It works well for what i need it for! The only issue I've noticed, is that sometimes when I bend over to reward my dog, treats spill out the side (which make for a happy pup!)",3
"My pitbull wasn't too fond of this food, but he's a bit of a snob (likes Organic dog food). However, because pitbulls are known for gastrointestinal problems and certain food allergies like a few other breeds I like to keep him on a strict diet or else he gets the runs (not a pretty sight). If you're dog is getting the runs or throwing up frequently, like mine was, talk to your vet about possibly changing their food to a primarily fish diet.",5
The only salt I use.,5
"It's doing what it's supposed to do, which is help my dog eat better/more safely.  I have a golden retriever that is really tall.  Originally his bowls were on the floor but he would have problems swallowing and end up coughing.  Thought this might be a good and affordable way to get his food at more of the proper level.  That part's great.
The reason I knocked a star off is simply because it's VERY lightweight.  It takes nothing to knock it, sending water everywhere!  You barely tap it and there's water on the floor and up against the wall.  If it had some kind of weight to it, it would be just about perfect.",4
"Super easy to assemble and it looks great! My 3 cats love it. I had been wanting to buy one for years now and I'm so glad I got this one! The ONLY thing is the smell. It reeked of some sort of vinegar. Strange, but it was so strong that I had to open windows and leave the room for a while. It's been 24 hours and it isn't as strong, but it'll go away eventually.",5
Works great for removing ticks,5
"I gave this toy as a Christmas present to 2 of my nephews for their dogs.  One dog is well known for ripping her toys to shreds within hours of receiving them.  This toy actually lasted for several weeks.  This record has not been broken by any other toy.  Once the stuffing and squeaker were gone, she still enjoyed throwing the toy around.  The other dog quit playing with it because she couldn't rip it to shreds so that is actually a recommendation for this toy's durability.",4
"I should have bought a bigger size. The one I got is small. And it really is very small. I need to make 3 loads of this squirrel to make 1 serving for my pup.

The idea with prongs in the hole is great!!!

We feed our puppy only from this toy! With a similar kong toy it was too easy for my puppy to get the kibble. The prongs in the squirrel make it not that easy (but anyway with some experience my pup can empty it in 5 min). I did not cut the prongs and the current size of the hole is perfect for the size of my puppy's kibble.

The quality is very good. The rubber feels very velvety and smells like vanilla.",4
Our puppy sleeps with this every night!,5
"Our vet said Blue Buffalo brand of dog food is the only one on the market that he'd feed his dog.  It's worth every penny, our dogs have thrived since switching brands.  He also said many people feed their pets ""Old Roy"", and while it must taste good , as most pets readily eat it, it's very poor nutritionally.....you get what you pay for!  Blue Buffalo pet treats are equally great in quality, and most are a good price.  HE SAID TO AVOID ANYTHING FROM CHINA AS THEIR TREATS HAVE CAUSED LOTS OF DEATH IN MANY ANIMALS.....SO BECOME A LABEL READER!",5
Good product as described Quick delivery,4
"This is a very strong and durable product which easily accomodates my older 80 pound dog. He is ramp trained and really gets a good grip, even when wet, since the surface is very gritty and it appears it will not wear off anytime soon. It folds in half and has a lock to keep it folded. We are using it on the side door sill of my 2007 Honda CR-V and I am very pleased with this purchase.  The delivery time was excellent.  This ramp would not be long enough, in my opinion, to use on the rear hatch door sill, especially on a larger SUV - order the longer one for that purpose so that the incline is gentler and easier on the joints when comimg down.",5
This spray works but you have to apply it often. I guess there's no way to ever complete get rid of mosquitos and fleas so I would rather have temporary results than none at all.,4
It doesn't grunt - it squeaks.,3
It was delivered today and very easy to put together. It's sturdy and a perfect size for my 12.5 lb cat. She already is enjoying lounging and grooming on the top tier.,5
did not work on my truck seat belts,2
Nice and plush.  My cats are BIG and wish I would have bought a larger one for each one of them but one fits it in nicely.  I am ordering another for my other cat now.  One of my cats has dominated this one so MUST get another.,5
put them in my tanks adjusted to desired temperature and spot on! they are working brilliantly.,5
My dogs love this bed.,5
"Great crate, the divider is absolutely necessary with a small pup. We got it for our Boston Terrier who weighed in at a meaty 4 pounds when we brought her home. She promises to hit close to 20 pounds and I don't foresee any need to buy a bigger crate.",5
No measuring scoop in the bottle. Hard to measure. Will not buy it again. Other brands come with scoops.,2
"I like these, it gave my pups more room to play.",5
it is tough as described,5
"It is OK. Cat will play with it, has already learned how to adjust it to get treTs out faster.",5
"I've had issues trying to feed my cats the nasty sticky hairball lube, they never liked it and would always run from me if I tried to smear it on their paw.  These tablets are large, I was shocked at first when I opened the bottle how big they are.  They are about the size of a quarter, and about as thick as an almond.  I worried the cats would never eat them because they are so big, BUT, these tablets are filled with something (kitty crack) that when cats smell it they will go crazy.  I've bought three bottles and the tablets can range in size, sometimes they are large and relatively flat, sometimes they are smaller in diameter and thicker (imagine a rolo candy).  I don't understand why they are inconsistent in size, but the large flat ones are easier for my cats to eat.

EDIT 06/22/12

After feeding my cats the Vets Best Hairball aid I am sad to state that they are a complete failure.  I fed my three cats the recommended dosage of 2 pills a day and one of my cats would hack up a hair ball almost daily.  I really wanted these to work since my cats love them, but they have been proven so far to be just overpriced cat treats.",2
good construction,4
"Great price for these. Nice because the dogs get a variety of yummy treats. Only con is since its 2# bag, you may get a couple large bones and not much of anything else but it's like a surprise in every package.",4
trying something new can't say it's working but i can't say that it not working either,4
My elderly friend's cat loves these treats. We've tried several other brands and he won't eat them. The Amazon price is better than the price at my local Publix store. I've ordered this four times now.  It is usually delivered in a timely manner. One shipment didn't arrive. I notified Amazon and they sent another one the same day. I will purchase this product again.,5
"Made for dogs.  We have large dogs and love, love, love this toothbrush! Have given them as gifts to other pet parents. Price is on point too. Last a long time.",5
"As with any dog treat, you must monitor your pet while consuming but Greenies are the best! My dogs know exactly when it is Greenie Time!",5
I like it. My dog not so much. But it seems to be working. I started with this companies Hawthorn berry extract which also worked really well. I use it in combination with RX vitamins CV for Dogs & Cats & Co Q-10. My dog has a level 5 heart murmur .,5
Doesn't solve my problem - but does help.,4
"It works, but for some reason my cats are tracking a lot more litter out of the box than they did with the other style.",3
"I got this for my mom's cats, they immediately started playing with it and it didn't take long for them to figure out how to get the balls out. I plan to buy another box for my own cats.",5
"This is a fantastic toy for dogs that are tough chewers and tear up toys really fast!  I have two french bulldogs that can destroy anything within a matter of minutes.. However, this one has held up for nearly a year (and counting) and continues to be a favorite.  They love to grab opposing ends of the ball and play tug-of-war.",5
My dogs like this very much. Great!,5
perfect size to fit inside a crate.,5
"Our guinea pigs love it very much, recommend it to guinea pig parents.",5
It does help quite a bit with my doggies bad breath...at least now I can make them smell of mint when they lick me :),5
My dog loves these and I love that they're healthy.,5
"Nice fit, comfortable for my 4-legged friend and just as hoped when I ordered it.",5
I love these treats and so do my dogs.  I love that I know the calories of each and they're made of all good natural stuff.,5
"I put this down in the laundryroom where my 2 toy poodles were using their four paws wee wee pads.  One of them jumped in and it slid a little, but she was able to use it fine.  The other one, who is much more hyperactive, jumped in, slid halfway across the room, freaked out, jumped out and relieved herself on my white tile.  This needs to have some sort of grip on the bottom so it won't move.",3
It took a while for us to receive it but the product is still working.,5
"One of the o-rings that tethers to a hook to secure the hammock in place ripped after only the 4th use.  My dog hasn't even hit 30 lbs., but somehow the Kurgo Hammock has not held up.  Very disappointed and probably won't return as a customer if this is the quality of product Kurgo produces.",2
"I have a husky and she sheds like crazy! I just use this 3 times a week on her and her coat not only feels softer but it looks beautiful and bright! This product cleans the under coat beyond good! In a matter of 15 minutes, I can brush off her dead hair. Could not be happier with this product! Definitely a buy! I see these all the time at the local pet store for 50 plus dollars and my advice is to just buy on amazon because you can get it cheaper!",5
Super aquarium great size and sound!,5
"I have to say, I thought that the flyer was going to be a little more sturdy.. or maybe thicker. The Stick is okay, but we will have to monitor it super close for punctures.
I do have to say, that the peanut is a giant hit!!",3
Very nice !  It was a bit too tall for my tank but I just removed a few of the ends of the taller ones and it fit.,5
"The dogs love these, they bounce great and sturdy enough for many chuck-it sessions and the dogs chewing on them",5
Won't buy these for my dogs again. My 10# chewed big chunks off within a matter of a couple days. Not good for digestion if swallowed.,2
"If you have a colder room or like me an old bird, this is great!  My bird love it, sits by it all of the time!",5
excellent,5
"Should have paid attention to the measurements.  This is a very tiny blanket.  Definitely not what I wanted for my 18lb pooch.  He still sleeps with it, but it's not going to cover much.",3
"Critical care is a must-have for any cavy, chinchilla, or rabbit pet parent. This has saved one of my pigs from stasis several times when the emergency vet wasn't open (the guinea pig in question in special needs). Do not go without this, and do not go without reading about how to give this to your pet in proper doses!",5
"I've used other replacement shower heads and various hoses that you attach to the faucet and been disappointed with them all...until I installed the Rinse Ace! I am not very handy at all when it comes to household plumbing jobs but this was so easy to install. Granted, the fixture would be nicer if it was metal and feels somewhat flimsy. But you can't argue with results, and it works beautifully. I just store the hose attachment under the sink until needed, pop it onto the connector and it's ready to go. So easy! I have shelties and getting their water-resistant double coats soaked and rinsed is always a chore, this makes it so much faster and easier. The hose is nice and long so I can reach all sides of my dog without moving him much around the tub and the water stream is powerful and easily turned on and off with the button on the handle. Thanks for this great product!",5
It works. The comb is good for breaking fur ball and removing food stain on fur.,4
My Yorkie Poo loves this on her breakfast! It has helped with her itchy skin! I use a half pump once a day and she runs to the refrigerator and barks because she knows that's where I store it!,5
My mother gave us a rather large turtle who was getting attacked by her other turtle. My son set up a large tank half water & half land. I bought several items &  He LOVES the treats the most.,5
"Good materials used, the design needs to improve slightly,: the smallish button on the back needs to be larger and more durable because it's the one that can hold the vest in place while one zips the vest.
Also a little more room on the top part of the shoulder would allow more freedom of movement.",4
Product as advertised. Really cute costume except my dog hated the wig (normal for Shibas).,5
"Excellent treats! My dog has tried 3 flavors (Chicken, Pork, and Salmon) and loves all of them. The salmon one does cause fishy breath so I won't get that one again, but I regularly get the chicken one and just recently bought the pork flavored one because it was a lower price than the other flavors. These are great small sized treats and I've even mixed a few in with my dogs regular food to encourage her to eat or meal in the past.",5
Received in timely manner. product so far is doing what it supposed to do.,5
Freeze-dried shrimp are one of my go-to mani-pedi rewards.  The kitties love it.,5
Perfect for letting our two cats cuddle up and stay warm,5
My dogs ate this without too much reservation.  I have come to expect that the food with the lesser quality ingredients will be ones that they will eat quicker.  I like it because they eat it but I am not a huge fan of soy being an ingredient.  I love my mutts so I try to purchase the healthiest food for them that I can afford.  This one will not be number one on my shopping list.,4
HUGE,1
My 8 month old lab went nuts for these. Combines his two favorite things....tennis balls AND squeaky toys.,5
"I received this product at a reduced price for giving my honest opinion. What I really love about this product is there is NO crap in it! It is flavored with beef! What is better is my dogs loves them! They will eat most things but there are some treat/vitamins out there that they really doesn't care for. That is not the case with this. They love them! I was using the liquid kind, but couldn't be sure how much my smaller dog was getting, because she wasn't eating all her food. And my bigger dog would eat her food and finish the smaller ones, so I wasn't sure how much she getting either. But they both like these soft chews, so I know they are each getting just the amount they should be getting.",5
works great with nice color,5
My dog loves it!,5
would buy again.  Works very well for our little dog.,5
"Mine lost some moss in the tank, but what did survive looks good.  My shrimp love it.",3
"***I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.***

This sweater is warm, cute, and well-made. I really thought it would be thinner, but it is decently thick, which is great for keeping my 15 pound Chihuahua mix warm. She gets cold pretty easily, so I am glad that this sweater is warmer than I thought it would be. As soon as I got the sweater out of the box, she was sniffing it and trying to get her nose in it to put it on. She really seems to like it.

The stitching on it is strong and even, so it should hold up well. The colour is a little bit darker, with more of an orange-y undertone, but I still thought it was a nice colour. I like that you can unfold the neck to supply a little more warmth to your dog, if you want. Another thing I like is the length of the arms. A lot of dog sweaters cut off at the shoulder, or only a little bit below, but these are about 2 1/2 inches long on the XL.

This sweater is not for large dogs. The XL loosely fit my 15 pound Chihuahua mix, who has an 18 inch chest circumference, 16 inch back length, and a 10 inch neck circumference. Still, I like the way it fits and would not have wanted a smaller size. It would comfortably fit a somewhat larger dog, but not much.

Unfortunately, this sweater does not have a hole for a leash. If that is an important feature for you, keep that in mind before purchasing.",5
"The clip-on combs are worthless on my curly Cavapoo, but the clippers alone work great on her.  I like her cut short so it works out ok for us.",4
Great product but a bit on the expensive side.,4
"Good short term, no ants.  But you leave it a day or two in an area with many ants then they will eventually find a way to the remaining food inside. In areas with a just few ants it works well. Wash well between feeds and any ant trails are washed away. I bought two, so can change them over quickly whilst washing one.",4
"Perfect design, very strong.  I cannot flaw this dog reel except that it does not come with a wrist safety holder in case you lose the grip on the handle due to carpel tunnel or arthritis.  While this is not a minus, it would be a super plus if one came included.",5
"Both of our items arrived torn and damaged.  One of our cats really like it, but these were no better than just free Costco boxes as there was no real textured side of the cardboard exposed for scratching.  N",2
"We are always looking for a special and nutritious treat for our Boy.  We have tried various chicken jerky products but upon closer look, we note they are sourced from China. We tried these because they are organic and made in the US, and they are a hit.
These treats are hard and a bit difficult to break up, but they are our Scottie's favorite treats, and one of the only ones that elicit an automatic ""sit""!
This is a good product and very reasonably priced.",5
My dogs will do anything for 1/2 of one of these...and these are big dogs! They even take a little time to chew,5
"My puppy loves this carrier ! It's padded on the bottom , lots of ventilation for this hot Fl. Weather .the reason 4 stars not 5 because the sizing is off. My puppy was 5.4 lbs and won't have enough room to grow . Defiantly not for Med size dogs . She's a couple lbs more now and still is ok but I would go up a size .",4
This really helps my older dog to get around better.,4
good,5
ok,5
These are a special treat for my dogs.,5
"my dog loves it, gets bright fast and holds glow quite long.",5
Do people know how good this dog food is for their dogs?,5
This is a good collar for training your dog.,5
The peg concept is nice if you have a small dog to use this; i.e. 4-7 pounds.  If have a dog that is bigger than that and jumps up instead of walking up the pins don't say in and the steps bounce a bit even if they do stay.,3
nice sturdy dog toy,5
"On time, as expected, well made and appropriately packaged.  My Pug is ~ 27 lbs.  It has enough space for him to lie down and sit up.  It's well made and sits up high enough he can see out the window which he really likes.  It's very comfortable and he enjoys it much more than a boxed crate.  My only concern with this product, as with any car seat for a pet other than a crate, would be in the event of a crash.  It won't save him. I discovered that when you put the seat belt under the seat, both the shoulder strap and the lap belt parts must secure the seat rather than just the lap belt part of the seat belt.  Twice he fell out of it when I only had it secured with the lap belt part when I came to a sudden stop and then made a jerking motion to avoid something in the road.",4
Hood falls over his face. Can't use.,1
My daschund loves them.,5
and what dog doesn't?  This thing came apart in seconds.  It didn't take much to toss this in the trash. Big disappointment.,2
"Big and fluffy, easy to wash, it's perfect.",5
Very durable for my 50 lb bull terrior/pit bull mix. My dog has a history of breaking leashes and this has been the most reliable yet. I have been using it for about 10 months now and it's still good as new.,5
"I bought these for my Habitrail cages and they work perfectly! I'm building a crazy set up and needed more locks. Great quality.

Please click yes if you liked my review.",5
my puppy loves them and they freshen his breath. I am a repeat buyer. Must add the price is much lower than the pet shops in my area and other pet sites,5
"Item arrived quickly, was sealed properly.  Great addition to my medicine cabinet for cat, dog, rabbit and chickens.  4 oz sis a small amount, but fine for this size animal.  Competitively priced.  Very happy with it.",5
This is much larger than anticipated! Fits all my rats and they love it! Cozy and cute!,5
"My dog rips these open in seconds, I wish they were a little sturdier.  I've had balls that looked simliar that lasted much longer but this brand did not.",1
"All my dogs love these, however beware you can't just get these and give to an adult dog, they typically don't like them.  If you start them as a puppy when they are teething they love them for life.  I'm a breeder and have tested this numerous times.  Because of these my dogs back 20 years have never had to have a dental cleaning or procedure, ever.",5
Birds love it,5
Great buy works really good,5
grand daughter's,5
"If I could give this zero stars I would. This was a total waste of money.

Two lab puppies, smart little dogs, who get into all kinds of trouble if they aren't given something to keep them active both physically and mentally.

We bought this because they'd have to bat it around to get the treats out, and we thought it would take awhile for them to figure it out and at least get an hour of entertainment out of it.

HA! An hour later, they were both sound asleep and the entire top yellow portion was gone. Just gone. We found it over the course of the next 3 days as it passed through their systems.",1
"My cat, Texas, begs for these. They are more affordable than most cat treats. He loves all the flavors but the  Blissful Catnip flavor makes him throw up. I gave that one to a neighbor who has a cat.",4
"This is the first time I have used this style pinch collar. I really didn't want to use my normal pinch collar because my dog is a PitBull and I don't want automatically assume that he is mean. He's just a sweet baby that is in the middle of his training. This collar is great. I find it to be the best of both worlds. 1. The collar basically looks solid black when it's on my dog so he no longer looks dangerous. 2. The collar pinches just enough to get my dogs attention, which is all I need when training.
If you found this review helpful please click ""yes"" below so that I know I'm not just wasting my time writing them",5
"It's carbon. What is there to say!  I used this in a filter sock for my rena XP3.  It works great.  It's extremely dusty, guess that's a result of it being a little more finely ground.  No big deal at all. Good stuff!",5
I love these tags! they are more unique and better quality compared to those cheap ones in the vending machines next to the door at walmart. (eek!),5
a must have for puppies! Also LOVE the extra piece it comes with that allows you to make the cage smaller and adjust it as your puppy grows.,5
Works on my Pom,5
"For the first time I had a fish with a white fungal cotton looking growth. I found out about this on a blog, tried it, and my fish are fine. Success!!",5
"I love the reflective collar, it's very strong, so I love it won't snap.  It looks great on my German Shephard puppy.  I bought her a black and orange leash to match, they go together perfectly.",5
I received this today and absolutely love it! This item was packed very securely and was easy to assemble. I needed to purchase a kitty litter tray that would fit properly. The box looks great in my bathroom. I really love this. It looks so much better than my old eye sore of a kitty litter box.  I ordered elsewhere but wanted to review here.,5
Thing for what I wanted. Sent back,1
"Seems to be a good product, price is just crazy though. I love the fact that it is high in Taurine for my cat but I'm gonna have to go on welfare to afford these! Why so $$$???",3
"The concept was great but when I ordered it I learned that this product has octinoxanate and oxybenzone, two sunscreen compounds that are known to disrupt the endocrine system in humans. I actually avoid using sunscreens with these compounds myself!",1
"Cheaply made and broke on the seventh paw I clipped. With a 30 day return policy, you can't clip enough times on two dogs to break them unless you clip them every other day during the 30 day return period. Handles are cheaply made and break right at the hinge. Clippers are far from professional grade, too. Don't waste your money on these. Get some that are a better grade.",1
Dogs love this healthy tarter control treat,5
Great toy for my quaker Chloe.  But she killed it in about three hours after it was hung up in her cage.  I gave it two stars because she had fun with it while it lasted. Also was made with natural fiber parts. Which is great for them in claw and beak management.  The only thing that is left of this toy is part of the half chewed fiber ball and the little fiber stars. She likes the stars to carry them to the highest part of her perch and drops them.,2
Cute outfit for the grand puppies. I also bought in Red too!,5
This is the only dog food my dog will eat!,5
DVD worked on my computer but not in my DVD player connected to my TV.,2
"We have had these before but now they have been updated and are even better quality. Our dogs love them! We have one that is really subtle when she asks to go out but uses these like a charm! We don't miss her requests anymore. Fantastic training aid, very easy for just about any dog to pick up.",5
"I have a 20 lb. cat who has litter box issues, so I switched to jumbo disposable litter boxes years ago.  That did not wholly solve the inappropriate pee problem, but I've just about given up on that.  When peeing in the wrong place, he usually uses the puppy pads I have here, there and everywhere, which is good enough for me.  No, I've been looking to solve the other problem: while he always enters the litter box from the front, he refuses to leave it from the front, jumping over the side instead,missing even the extra large litter mat and tossing litter everywhere in the process.  But there was never a covered litter pan that had enough head room for him and would hold a jumbo disposable litter box--until now!  I fold up the flap and filter section to give him more space--he uses this box just fine and I have less litter all over my condo.  Problem solved!",5
"This litter box actually deserves ZERO stars, a big goose egg because that's about the size of it. We are a household of 8 cats different sizes including two kittens. The box works for them only. We have several types of litter boxes that work better and cost less. I am amazed at the all the positive reviews and wonder who the heck these folks are?",1
Seals our dogs food and treats without getting stale. Would definitely recommend.,5
After 4 months and the inside of bed is tearing and had to throw it away. My Schnauzer did like this bed very much,2
Works for cat's ibd.,5
Perfect records,5
"This is a great toy for puppies. We filled it with peanut butter and put it in his crate as a way to get him used to it. We would also put treats in to keep him busy trying to get it out. He used this toy daily until his adult teeth grew in, at which point he started being able to take chunks out of it :-X Make sure to watch your puppy very carefully with this toy once it starts teething, but until then, this toy is great. Also, my dog is an aggressive chewer and never so much as made a dent in this thing while he still had his puppy teeth. We liked this so much, we went out and bought him an adult kong toy just like it, which he still uses to this day.  Also, you can fill this with wet dog food and throw it in the freezer overnight to provide some relief for your teething puppy.",5
"Very good product, and price",4
"My super chewer dog loves this toy, and as of yet hasn't shredded it. We don't leave it out with her all the time because she finds where the squeaker is on toys and disables them, but when it's play time she loves it!",5
"Excellent harness, we use these for our Shih Tzu. She seems to be very comfortable with this harness on, as we are able to leave it on her for extended times, and we will later find her laying around sleeping in it. It is easily adjustable, and well built.",5
"Since using this dog food, my older dog, who has a bit of arthritis, seems to be walking much better.  All my dogs seem to thrive on this.",5
"This kennel works great for transporting our hyper coonhounds (a 65 pound Black & Tan and a 75 pound Walker) to the vet and hauling them out hunting. Our Blue heeler is 70lbs and our pit bull is 120 lbs and they both fit into this kennel.

The plastic on this kennel probably isn't as thick or as durable as some of the older dog kennels, though most everything is made cheaper than they used to be.

We've had no problems with the door, ours works fine. This kennel is very easy to wipe clean too.

Overall, for the price here on Amazon (when I ordered here it was $60.99) if you use the Amazon Prime free 2 day shipping this kennel is less than $61.00 total delivered right to your door and that's better than our local Wal-Mart on the same item. So, I've very pleased with the value/quality of this kennel.",5
Great product could not be happier. The fact that it also shipped to my door is even better.,5
"Our dogs love these. We had only one for a year, and the dogs were constantly taking turns on the one, so we got a second to help keep them off of the rug! Great quality, easy to move and clean!",5
"I have a puppy who is 1/2 husky, 1/2 bloodhound. He has destroyed every toy I've given him. But not this. And he loves it! It's so squeaky that it keeps him busy for a good long time. Even when he's playing on his own. And the best part . . .no stuffing all over the floor.",5
the cats love them. they use them constantly.,5
item was what i expected,5
"It initially worked wonders on our 70-lb golden retriever that is, until she figured out that she can continue to pull if she keeps her neck stiff.  The motive for pulling is to hurry and get to the next house that has dogs outside so that she can visit them.  She's a strong-willed girl and maybe nothing will work on her, lol!",3
My dogs love these and it keeps them busy a long time.,4
Bought these a long time ago. Now my dog is grown up and can still fit in them but they are a bit small. Perfect for one we go to the mountians and there is a lot of wind!,5
"My 2 Sun Conures LOVE these huts.  The only problem is that they chew the bottom out of these with huge holes in about 10 days, then I have to toss them and start with a new one so it gets really expensive for me.  I wish these would come with a NON-Chewable/Destroyable bottom but the bottoms have a thin plastic encased in the fuzzy material and they destroy it so quickly.  PLEASE consider making a stronger bottom that can't be chewed through so quickly.  Thank you!!",5
It's ok. I had better odor eliminator with another brand,3
it is a great product  but my dogs HATE the taste,3
"Refill is what I expected, however my package came three weeks after I ordered it.",2
We've got two puppies on this food; a Havannese and a Golden Retriever. Both digest it very well. Both dogs have nice coats and are growing healthy. We like the dryness of the product as it helps with teeth cleaning. Each gibble is about the size of an aspirin tablet. We use about 30 pounds per months (most of it for the retriever).,5
"Excellent product, would buy again. These folks give Amazon a good name.",5
excellent,5
cat uses it,5
"I really love this car seat! My dog is 12lbs and I purchased size small, it fits just right. My dog likes to sleep in a ""doughnut"" position, so this car seat is perfect for him with little room to spare. If your dog is heavier and likes to stretch out I would go size up.
In the negative reviews I red that the car seat tends to lean forward and is not stable, I don't have that problem with mine, I suppose it depends on a make and model of your car, otherwise I don't have any other explanation for this problem :-). And Yes Sheep wool is not real (complaints from one star reviews), which was expected :-D, but is cozy and comfortable for the dog.
 Cover can be easaly romoved for a wash, I would recommend line dry instead of dryer.",5
My dogs love them,5
Built tough. Wish there was a way to keep the excess leash off the ground as I have a weiner dog and a lab.,5
"Love these collars.  My weinerchi loves it too!  First collar he hasn't destroyed, yet.",5
These are really really heavy and I am having a hard time getting my boys to play with them,3
"We purchased this product for traeting our dogs' teeth.  It is very good at removing tartar, plaque build-up and freshens their breath.  Highly Recommend this product.",5
"Great test kit for keeping tabs on our pond water. Easy to follow clear instructions, just make sure you follow them exactly. Definitely recommend, because as the saying goes, "" You keep water, not fish.""",5
Out Boston Terrier enjoys this toy. So far no damage and the rubber is holding up. The slits in the sides are a bit too small to hold a firm treat.,5
Great litter !!,5
"This is FAR too small for a betta. They are not decorations, they are living aninals that require a heated and filtered 2.5 gallons at the absolute minimum, 5 gal and up is much better and more people are recommending this as the minimum. They are not puddle fish, they're naturally found in shallow but VERY WIDE rice paddies with each male having their own 3 square feet of territory they will defend.

Also, if you only use this as a vase, keep in mind what you plant in it. Some plants can't handle having their riots constantly wet and will more or less drown in it.",1
These wipes are useless. They simply do not work. I have better luck with Kirkland brand baby wipes at a tiny fraction of the cost of these tissue paper wipes.,1
These are great! Keep in mind that after you give it to them you should give it again a week later to kill of the larve that hatches.,5
Good product. Will buy again.,5
"I CAN ONLY USE THESE WITH MY ONE DOG, NOT THE OTHERS.  HE GULPS THEM DOWN WITH A PILL IN THEM, THE OTHERS KNOW ITS IN THERE AND SPIT THEM OUT.",4
"My Ploco, WALRUS, LOVES IT. It seems he's always on it. My upside down cats seem to like it as well. YOU NEED TO BOIL it until it's water logged- this also removes all loose grit. I recommend this wood very highly. My Koolie Loach Loves hiding in one. ;-)",5
"My little girl is very picky, but has always LOVED these! They sometimes stick to her teeth, but are VOHC certified to clean. I don't often notice a huge difference in her oral health with these (brushing is always best) but she does chew on them as they are intended, they are about the density of taffy, but have a more waxy feeling (not sticky at all).",5
Best for Arthritis.  I give my boy (Duke) whatever he wants/needs.,5
all good!,5
"Our largest dog has a sensitive stomach, and some glucosamine supplements have caused irritation. We had to discontinue use of another product because it was not recommended for dogs with bladder stones, but our vet says Nutramax is safe and effective.  Fortunately, Nutramax is palatable and easy on his digestion.  I believe he is doing better in terms of his mobility too.  Finally, while this product is one of several measures we are taking to help our dog's joints, there is no doubt his gait has improved.",5
This is great!  I can now groom my Havanese myself and it is really easy.  I did watch a youtube video first.,5
Really good pig ears.,5
GOOD DEAL!,4
"Worked as intended. And, everyone loves the pic when my dog has this on.",5
"Exactly what I was excepting. Only drawback is in the packaging. Was delivered rolled up like a newspaper and it too a couple of days under some books to get this thing to lie flat on the floor. For the mat to serve its purpose, which is catch water dripping and food droppings, I wouldn't go above 16 oz bowls. Our 32 oz bowls can't fit side to side on this thing.",5
"Quality was horrible, with an elastic band breaking as soon as I took it out of the plastic; I sent it back the next day.",1
"Nice harness, its well made and my beagle mix puppy looks adorable with it on.",5
my dog loves to get a bath with this before bed time this is around the 6 one I have gotten and no problems at all.,5
"The lid/top doesn't stay on. I have a rock sitting on top to keep it in place. Other than that, it's ok, seems to be working fine.",3
It is hard to review  a pet product  the best bully bones matched the amazon description they came on time and Ranger likes them.,5
"She looked over her shoulder, her ears perked and listening for any sounds. Nothing. Good. She slowly approached the object on the floor, a smart bones sweet potato dog bone. One of her favorites. Her mouth began to salivate at the thought of crunching down on that non raw hide outer layer and extracting that sweet potato goodness. My my, what a nice start to the day. Its her reward for being such a good girl, keeping unknown threats at bay with some well timed barks and of course, shedding all over the house. You're welcome, ungrateful humans.",5
"Do not glow on the dark at all,cheap so nothing to complain.",2
"This is the greatest flea killer of all time.  I don't like putting flea powder or collars on my cat and she does like to go out into the garden.  There are squirrels there with fleas and she does pick them up.  Or rather they pick on her.  I give her a pill and 30 minutes later, NO FLEAS.  Great since they don't live in the carpet either since they cannot get back onto the cat or they will die.",5
Easy to use and works well with several dogs using the area. I spray it on the porch and over the whole yard twice a month. Does not harm plants in pots near by.,5
Very very good quality product and a reasonable price!,5
My dog has only been taking this for about 3 weeks but I notice that she is scratching a lot less and her coat shines,5
Exactly what it is supposed to be.,5
It does what it's supposed to do (collect loose litter outside of letterbox entry point) but I wish it was a bit larger.,3
"Both my boys love this food and prefer it over all the others we have tried (Merrick, Wellness Core, Taste of the Wild).",5
"If you want to keep your cat out of a certain area, this is the product for you. I had trouble with a couple of my male cats marking certain areas of the house, but after buying a few of these and placing them in those areas, not one more problem, if you are going crazy trying to keep your cat away from an area this is the best product on the market.",5
"I bought a Hamilton collar of this style for a large dog.  120#.  Chasing a squirrel in the park and coming to the end of the lead,  the abrupt snap caused the steel ring to move up over the buckle and release the snap tabs.  Voila!  Loose dog!
Not something you would want to happen around traffic or people who are afraid of dogs.",1
When we were looking for a healthier balanced dog food we tried a few different brands only to find that our dogs are shockingly picky eaters. They absolutely devour this food and it has a good balance of nutrition for them.,5
I returned it....I have a small dog & it was just too big.  Wish they had a smaller model,2
"Great product, but my pups hate it unfortunately",5
Excellent product,5
"I will not buy these again because my dog swallows very sharp, very brittle bits of these ears.  I like the other ones that are more like rawhide.  They are softer and easier for her to swallow.",3
"I regret buying this. The only place this seems to work is on carpet. When I shined the light on a known pet stain nothing showed up. When I shine this on the inner walls of the litter box, not a thing shows up! When I tried it on a known troubled area that has a tiled floor, nothing shows up. On walls, nothing shows up. Very disappointed in this purchase. 20 bucks on purple light. Thanks!!",1
"Love these filters, works great.  I use them in all my tanks",5
"This seems to be a very good HEALTHY dry food for my cat -- and he enjoys it.  If you know finicky cats, you'll know this is a plus.",5
"It's perfect for my maltipoo!  The soft pink is so nice and girly. The bowls stay in place, and they are dishwasher safe. Highly recommend!",5
Cat likes this!,5
"The cats don't like the whole veggies in it, but will eat most of it if I mash them.  No digestive problems with it just picky cats.",4
Replacement for my petsafe invisible fence. I wish the actual batteries were swapable but these work. I have been too lazy to look for any other solution. These last 1-2 months depending on how frequently she checks the boundry.,5
"It has worked rather well, I can even use the pager & he'll respond now.  Wish there was a dummy one instead always having to use real one.",4
"I initially loved these small, inexpensive thermometers.  I have purchased several.  They are inexpensive, small, easily positioned, easily moved between tanks, and easily read outside the tank.  Unfortunately, in my experience, many of them are inaccurate and some of them are highly inaccurate.

Although I have bought a few different brands, they all look exactly the same and I can only conclude that there is likely just one contract manufacturer stamping different brands on their product.  Unfortunately, I have found significant inconsistencies in these devices, regardless of brand.  In my experience, if I put 8 of these (this brand and others) in the same aquarium at the same time and in roughly the same spot, I will get 5 - 8 different readings.  Many of those readings will be fairly close, say within one-half of one degree, but some will be more than a full degree off and some will be several degrees off from the majority.  When compared with a traditional thermometer, I find that most of the digitals are within one-half of one degree, but again, several are one+ degree off with a few being way out of alignment.

Based on my experience and informal testing of about 8 - 10 units (from various brands, including this one), I cannot recommend these digital thermometers for applications that require precision within less than about one-half of one degree -- and, even then, you have to check your thermometer regularly to ensure it is measuring within that range.

If anyone has found a highly consistent and accurate digital thermometer for aquarium use (FW), please let a comment below with your recommendation.  I need several.  Thanks.",2
"Nicely detailed, lots of space for small cats, not large cats. Plenty of windows for peeping out. Sometimes we have to use it to take her to the Vet and such. Our cat hates being in there but it keeps things nice and calm while traveling.",5
"My dog had an open sore that he wouldn't stop gnawing on.  I tried using Vetericyn, but it did not deter him.  So, I took him to the vet who thought it was an allergy and gave him a hydrocortisone shot.  She said she might start him on anti-anxiety meds and to call her in a month if it didn't stop.  Well, I didn't want to put him on meds, and the gnawing wasn't stopping: The sore was just getting larger and larger.  The groomer said it might be fungus, so I tried Tinactin, but that didn't help either.  We went on a trip and stopped by my cousin's who was also his breeder.  The grand-daughter took one look at it and said, ""Oh, it looks like a hot spot to me!""  So, I bought this stuff.  Oh wow.  Not only did it work, but when I asked my dog for his leg, he would give it to me instead of running away.  The spot is completely healed now!",5
Helps to keep our dogs coat shiny and prevents her skin from drying out during the winter months,5
I'm probably going to buy these again,5
This dress fits my little one very well. She looks super cute in it!,5
My Boxer loves this doo food. It agrees with him well and I have been able to keep his weight in exactly the right spot!,5
"You don't have to use an entire pocket; pinch off enough to cover pills. They last a long time when properly sealed and stored in a cool location,",5
my dog loves these and her teeth are clearly better than before.  I can't buy enough of them. she has one daily.,5
"I've purchased several squeaker toys from this brand. They have unique toys that my lab loves.  I also purchased the squirrel house which we were also very happy with, and you cannot beat the price.",5
"We initially bought this product about a month and a half ago in hopes of preventing one of our four cats from leaving ""packages"" on the carpet and other innapropriate non-litterbox places. We've been engaged in this battle with her for months, and every time anyone in the house so much as looks at her crosswise, she'd go find something to mark, including hopping on the counters and peeing on the toaster, or my purse etc. We'd already removed everything from floors she was previously using to register her protests but every time we'd remove something, she'd just find something new to target. Additionally our two half-oriental kitties were both showing signs of stress, such as overgrooming and one had asthma-like congestion. Apparently this sometimes happens to the oriental breeds when they are under stress.

We got three of these diffusers for our house, and though the change was somewhat gradual at first, the situation did really improve over the first 4 weeks. The last two weeks, when the diffuser was running low we noticed some backsliding with the one cat using the carpet again. As soon as we replaced the refills again, the issues stopped once more. Additionally, there have been many fewer conflicts between all four of the house's feline occupants, and the cat having the breathing problems has really improved. This product is fantastic!",5
"When i feed my babies Stella & Chewy's Chicken Patties, i rest easy in that they are eating the very best. No toxins, no bacteria, no animal byproducts, no filler ~just good wholesome nutrition.",5
My cats hated it and my trash can even hated it. I had to cut it down to size to fit this junk in. Waste of money.,1
All of my dogs love love love these!,5
Love it!!,5
The head could be just somewhat smaller and the bristles shorter and softer. But easier to brush with but still a struggle.,3
"Good value, absorbs well.",5
Did not help my female beagle with bladder problems,2
I really like this pump! The style and power are great plus its quiet! The price is the best too!,5
Didn't notice any difference except cat smelled better.,3
Needs a little help the taste. My dog is a picky eater. When ran out tried same named produce but different ingredients; dog was underwhelmed with flavor.,4
Smells to strong,1
Works especially well on my standard poodle puppy's baby hair.,5
"Smells so good! I used the black four paws for a few years, which I think smells really good. This gold one smells better, more girly for my dog. So clean, and lasts for a few days that's why I like the Four Paws brand, I have used other brands but they don't last like these do.",5
"My beagle LOVES this stuff. It does smell like fish, and it makes his excrement smell very strongly of fish. If you don't like that smell, get something else. I live with it because it's nutritious and tasty for him!",5
"Like I said, great for what they do, which is to pick up and throw away dog waste. I have used about 1500 or so of these so far I would say and they work great. I never had any holes or leaks. Some have even gone through the washer and dryer and still been fine, although I throw them out at that point anyways(not taking the chance). I will order these again once I am low.",5
"Works like a freakin' champ! Just like the super expensive brand that I have seen at my local pet store - but much cheaper.
This thing gets SO much hair off my dog, it's quite a sight.",5
"Perfect for traveling. I carried two kittens on the plane with me from PA to FL. No problems getting through security, and fit right under the seat in front of me.",5
"My Havanese loves the Bully sticks.  He chews one stick between 20 minutes to one hour.  He loves to chew and the Bully Sticks are his favorite.
He is always asking for it.  We had to hide the package so that he can forget about it.

Thanks, these Bully sticks really keeps him busy.",5
Great product. Softer bristles than on the regular ones Like the rubber grip and the way the hair comes off of it with ease. All by the punch of a button. Great grooming tool for my cats who hate getting their fur brushed. Would buy again.,5
GOOD FOR THE MONEY,4
The kittens just love it.  The mewling starts the minute they see the can.,5
"This is the first review I have ever written, but I was compelled to share my experience this with potential customers.

This product is DANGEROUS. The On/Off ""Mode"" button (and all of the other buttons on the face of the remote) responds to the lightest pressure, so even if you have it turned off, it is very easy to accidently depress the Mode button, which turns in on again. A second press (once it is turned on) will deliver a shock. I made the stupid mistake of turning the remote off and putting it my purse and ended up shocking the hell out of my poor dog for no reason.

As if that was not a bad enough feature, the default mode is set to 'shock', so even though I had been using the vibrate mode, once it is turned off and then turned on again, it is automatically reset to shock mode! WTF?!?

This unit is also made of very flimsy, cheap plastic and the receiver comes off with the slightest roughhousing making useless at the dog park. Oh yeah, and there is one charger for both the remote and receiver, so you have to charge them one at a time. Horrible design. This product should be taken off the market. Save your money and be kind to your pet and invest in a quality e-collar.",1
"Bought the medium, it was a little loose and slid around a bit, but my dog loved it! Very comfy and adorable. Despite all the fluff, it doesn't get dirty or tangled very easily either.",4
Our dog loves these so much.,5
"Love this product! We have a pup with stomach issues occasionally, this product settles her stomach every time! Highly recommend!",5
Fit perfect.,5
"I purchased this nylon collar for a new small breed dog.  It fits perfectly (she's 20lbs), looks great, the plastic clip works well, the nylon is very soft AND the white comes clean with water (which is good, because she likes to roll in dirt).  I'm very happy with it and receive many compliments.",5
My bunny was dead within hours of being put in this thing.  I've had many rabbit cages in the past and this one looked good for our new Easter bunny.  It is big and sturdy but the platform the rabbit walks on is the height of my cat's shoulders and the wires are spaced an inch apart- plenty of room for a cat paw to enter.  The rabbit was getting a drink and my cat swiped his paw through the cage and grabbed the rabbit's legs pulling it through.  I just walked in to a gnarled on body and the rabbit's head was stuck between the wires of the cage.  Sorry about my being so graphic but better you read this than have you or your kids see what I just cleaned up!,1
This is such a cute shirt with vivid colors for the embroidery letters.  After reading reviews I ordered x-large for my 11 lb morkie.  It is slightly lg on him but with an adjustment or two it will work.  I love it and he looks cute in it,5
Was great just what I ordered only was a week late that was the only thing on this product that was bad.,3
my dog goes crazy for this when we take him to the lake!! a must have for water fetch,5
My kerry blue has bad teeth and keeping them clean is a pain but this spray works wonderfully even with my 9yr old kbt who is sensitive to most products,5
"I bought this as a travel carrier for my ferret. It is perfect. It is very roomy and the fact that the sides are not all closed up allowed us to interact with our pet the entire trip, which was a lot of fun. We did not have to worry about whether she is ok and I think being able to see us was good for her too.",5
"Not as soft as other paper based bedding I had, but it's hard to beat this price.",4
My fish loves these things.,5
Nice she walks better for me now.,4
Mice really enjoy these treats. Would purchase again.,5
"My dog is a 70 lb black lab/hound mutt and is what they call a ""powerful chewer"". I've tried elk antlers from a bunch of different companies, and my dog seems to love all of them - but this is the largest and most long-lasting antler that I've found so far. I worry a bit about her because this thing seems to be as hard as a rock, but she's been chewing it for quite some time now and hasn't had any issues yet. Be sure to keep an eye on your dogs while they gnaw away!",5
After couple years I finally decided to change the foam and I cannot be happier. Old foam shrinks and it doesn't absorb as much. This is must do for your filter.,5
I LOVE the ways these smell and the boys LOVE the way they taste. Makes for a good after training treat!,5
"Really poor quality , flimsy , doors are very difficult to latch and un latch , wood has splitting in several areas , drawer is difficult to take out and put in . Directions where hard to follow I ended up just figuring it out myself . I am truly dissatisfied with this item .",1
love it,5
It's not the easiest harness to take off and put on. Especially when you have a dog the moves around a lot when your trying to put it on and take it off the dog. I ordered a different harness cause I did not want to risk hurting my dogs arms someday.,1
The dogs love these!,5
"I compare the temp measure with the temp from my themo, and they seems matching.  For the price I paid, this is highly recommend to those who wants to constantly monitor the tank temperature.",4
"I bought this for a friend's dog and wrapped it and hid it under the tree.  My dog knew it was something awesome, unwrapped it, and has been playing with it since.  Turd.  Not very tough but he still loves it sans stuffing.",5
Keeps my pup warm and dry on his torso back,4
"Perfect size, it really controls the odor!",5
"The product was recommended by our vet - to enhance our cat's digestive system which is problematic. Ordering is convenient and delivery swift. Kitty is doing nicely, thank you!!!",5
Fish is not listed as an ingredient.  Why do all my dogs breath smell like hey have been eating fish.  What ingredient is causing this?,4
My kitty loves Fancy Feast. I do read the labels and try to stick with the ones that don't have any grain or the like in them.,5
"I ORDERED THIS TWICE; FIRST TIME I DID GET THE DOUBLE ORDER WITH EVERYTHING THEY SAID IT WOULD COME WITH.  I LOVE THIS SETUP.  MADE WELL BUT THE SECOND TIME I ONLY RECEIVED ONE AND NOTHING ELSE.  I HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE SUPPLIER WITH NOT A WORD BACK YET.

I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.  I WOULD NEVER PAY $15.00 FOR JUST ONE BUT TWO MADE SENSE.  I WANT THE SUPPLIER TO SEND ME WHAT I PAID FOR.  YOU OWE ME ANOTHER ONE.",1
Sturdy and easy to clean.  Took my dogs a few weeks to use this bed all the time but now they fight over it!,5
Good buy.  Great cat treat!,5
Nice product.  The food doesn't always come down all the way so i tap it with my foot.  No biggie,5
Had to use crate again after 8 yrs due to injury. Bowl works great to eliminate spillage for the 2 months of recovery. Very good product & shipped fast.,5
"My bunny growled at this and hated it. (Yes, I know. She has an attitude problem and we are working on it.) Bunnies love to perch, and because the top of this is not as wide as its base, perching would be really tough. I do love that she could have chewed on it without ingesting something harmful, but I think I would get a wooden one next time so she could both perch and chew (and hopefully use it to hide out and not growl at it.)",3
"I bought the excell senior vitamin supplements for my two 11 year old dogs and they love them! They are pretty picky when it comes to medicines and vitamins, but they eat these no problem and even think they are treats! I asked my vet and did research online for which vitamins are the best for small-breed older pups and the ingredients in these vitamins are great for them! They really have some great stuff in there. Particularly the lutein for their eyes and glucosamine for their joints. There are other vitamins present in this dog supplement that are also in my human vitamins, and I love giving them things of human quality. I feed these to my dogs whole as a ""treat"" right before dinner, for optimum absorption. Many other reviews commented on the fact that they are quite crumbly and break easily. This is very true, but if does happen you can just sprinkle the powder onto their food and add a tiny bit of water so it sticks to the kibble. I kind of liked the fact that it crumpled a bit so I can sprinkle a small amount on to my cats food too! There are more solid vitamins out there that are just as nutritious, so if the crumpling is an issue, this might night be the vitamin for you and your dogs. This was not however, and issue for us, as I think the soft-ness was what made my dogs like them so much (avoided the hard ""pill"" like texture).
:D",5
cleared dog up in a few days,5
"very small, very thin",3
"it arrived undamaged and in brand new condition.
haven't set it up yet but im sure it works wonderfully as its designed to funtion on its own, cordless :)",5
This was a very cool way to order a dog tag. I ordered this tag and paid for it via Amazon. Then the next morning I received an email from the company  with options for tag shapes colors and instructions on what to put on what sides as well as my line limits.  I filled out all the questions and send their reply back to the company.  Couple of days later I received a confirmation of what was supposed to be on my tag and that it was shipped. Within about seven day as I receive my tag in the mail in a standard size envelope with the exact email they sent me confirming my order. The tag cam in a plastic bag you with a  small ring to feed into the tags hole so it can connect to my dogs collar. The tag is very nice quality and the words are not painted on  so I feel like they will last quite a while. The large pink heart is what I got which you will see in the photo and is the perfect tags size for a large to medium size dog.  Down this process way easier than I thought it would be and I'm thinking about doing it again for my other dogs.,4
"My picture quality is awful,  and my cat looks angry af haha,  but you get the idea. This thing is huge and 2 large cats could fit in here.",5
"Finally!  I wish I'd have purchased this product first. The jar is super small, be careful upon opening it could get REALLY messy. Use the scoop too, a little goes a VERY long way. I have African Dwarf Frog tadpoles, and so far they have been ""eating"" crushed tadpole pellets, fry powder, and Liquifry #2. Unfortunately, I could never visually see them actually eating until now, and these previous products made the baby tank super cloudy, messy, and everything wound up making a disgusting sludge on the bottom of the 2.5 tank. It seemed like I was just wasting the products. A miniscule spoon of this, instantly there was artemia all over the place, and they don't settle! The filter pump is blowing them all over the place as if they were alive! The tads sprang to life like I had electrified the water. And this is the first time I actually saw them open their mouths. I was really thinking I needed to get into the stinky business of raising live brine shrimp for them to fully develop, but now I know - no way. This is fantastic. They were darting around, sucking them up, and as much as little tadpoles can look happy, these tadpoles definitely did. This has been an expensive hobby to date. Started with a 5 gallon tank and 6 frogs in April. I guess the planted tank, the frozen bloodworms, and Mopani wood made the conditions almost immediately perfect for breeding as they started singing almost immediately. By early May, my frogs were producing eggs almost every night. Everything I read said how difficult this was. As long as the water parameters were correct, weekly water changes, and feeding them every other day, it was a breeze. The eggs I would scoop out and put into a fishbowl. Most would not develop or the shock of moving them was a factor, I believe. I decided it is much better to leave the eggs in the tank until they hatch and use a baster to remove them 1-3 days later once I saw them swimming around the adult tank before they became a snack. In the fishbowl, they did fine. Daily water changes, powdered fish fry, and I kept them pretty warm. Once three got big, I got a 2.5 gallon tank, a good mini LED light, a small adjustable filter, and a line with an air stone. Now, I basically have an assembly line. Mortality rate is high at first, but it is important to separate the bigger ones from the small ones as SOON as it is possible for they do eat the little ones (so bummed). Honestly, I think all the foods I was using was going to waste because the bigger ones were eating the batches of smaller ones... now I know. But if you're wanting to raise ADFs, this stuff is fantastic. I would say it's a must. I am sorry about having lost all of those babies, please don't make my mistakes I would never have let that happen had I known. Having this stuff may have saved them... I will try to add photos soon...",5
Great food for my babies.,5
"I use these as filters for my fish tank. I was tired of paying so much money for like 2 pack filters and having to replace them every month. So I now make my own filters and I've never regretted it. My fish tank is super clean, the filter is filled with gunk and debris. Works amazing! I can change this as many times as I want without the expense. Works great for filters since it's thick and doesn't let anything pass through, basically scrubs the water clean.",5
"Please invest in an electronic fish feeder! This stupid thing killed my little Midnight. Nothing changed over the course of one week to the next, other than this thing. I was going away in a few months, so I decided to test this out before I left. It was in the tank for about 4 days before I found Midnight dead, covered in the gross white powdery stuff. She was such a good little fishy.",1
"One of my girls has asthma and I am continually challenged to find cat toys that do not contain catnip! I so wanted these toys to work out because I am so limited with the lack of toys out there that don't contain catnip and my kids get bored easily. These are of very poor quality and some of the ones that or on strings are WAY TOO SMALL AND DEFINATELY A CHOKING HAZARD!! As for the quality, I got a splinter just trying to get the ones out of the box! The idea of an elastic string that is tied through a hole on the wand sounds innocent enough until it comes undone the first time it is pulled on and God forbid a cat likes to play tug of war like mine and you accidently let go of the short, slick wand, it snaps back and hits your car in the face. These toys are going back in Immediately! I received an email asking me to contact the company before I post a review so they can fix any mistakes they made. This is not a problem that can be fixed with a replacement or a sorry note. This is a problem with design and execution. This is not a well thought out toy and it is certainly not made with quality products.",1
"I bought this as a chew toy for my lab/boxer/pitt but he didn't show much interest until I started putting Pupperoni or peanut butter in the holes. Then he goes at it. Once I realized that, I looked for Kong treats that would fit better, but they don't seem to make any. I started using stick Pupperoni, but my dog manages to get the ends of the sticks off and the middles stay stuck in the treat. He then gets bored and stops chewing on it after a while. I end up having to poke the treats out myself.",3
Love this toy.  The puppies can chew on it over and over and you don't even see a tooth mark in it and they love to play tug with it and chew on the rope.  Throw it in the washing machine and it is like new.,5
Excellent product,5
Vet had me switch to this.  Fixed her stools so there is no blood or mucus in them.  Vet recomended,5
"This pack is just perfect for our 55 pound German Shepherd / hound mix (he is thin for a shepherd)!! It worked so well on our 12 mile hike up Owl Head Mountain in NY. The vest is super easy to get on and off and adjust. I love that the saddlebags are Velcroed on and have a clip for extra hold. This design made it very quick and easy to tear off the gear and let him romp in the water with just the vest on to cool off.
There are little mesh pockets inside each side and straps to hold water bottles so they don't roll around. The handle on the top came in very handy too when we wanted to grab our dog to let passing hikers by without him jumping up for kisses. All in all, we really enjoy this pack and can not wait to use it in the future.",5
Works very well.,5
"Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious?  I recently switched to a top quality dry cat food which I give to our 3 cats daily, but I supplement that with canned ""wet"" food every 2nd or 3rd day.  The cats have adjusted to this new feeding method and really like their new foods.  Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Wild Rice is a fine product and I've ordered it through Amazon's subscription program so that it is sent to me on the interval that works best, and shipping is free.  A very great deal all around.",5
"Great quality, fantastic price.",5
"Doesn't really work for us, easy for cat to climb or jump on to.",2
"I have a mastiff who is far too strong for me if she sees a dog or bunny. I use this in conjunction with a harness to keep us both safe, and she's much more obedient with this on. She's a rescue, and I know nothing of her past life, but I can tell she's trained with one of these. It doesn't work great for her face shape, as it gets in her eyes easily, poor thing. I went with this, however, instead of a normal halter, because she needs to be able to pant... she gets hot quickly!",4
Great!,5
My cats love this product.  Such a great supplement...highly recommend this.,5
"I feel this is a good brand, and has not given my puppy any issues.  His coat always seems shiny, and soft.  Milo has graduated from the puppy formula to the regular formula with no apparent issues.",5
It is noisy and did not hold my cats attention for very long. It needed something for them to grab at under the shield. I  attached a feather to the mouse to make it more attractive and that worked for a while. It is very noisy  as it goes around. Not worth the money. Another toy that sits collecting dust.,2
"MY NEW DOG (7 MONTHS OLD WHEN I GOT HIM) CHEWED MY RUGS, WOODWORK, BOOKS, AND A FEW OTHER THINGS. I GOT THE NYLABONES AND HE LOVES THEM AND NOW I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PUT HIM IN HIS CAGE WHEN WE GO AWAY.",5
My fish was always in the corner under the filter and his fins would get stuck in it. I recently noticed it was pulling the ends off the. Now that I took the filter out he seems to be doing better.,2
"Just the right weight for most days living in the South.
Size up.......not true to size......",5
The lifesource things look like rubber pieces. There was NO scent to it at all to even entice him to want to try it. He's not picky and will try anything once. He look at it like I just poured rocks in his bowl. I returned it. Just wasn't his cup of tea,1
GREAT,5
"I saw that the only negative reviews were ones that were from when it came unassembled. Well, it came to me perfectly assembled and it does the job. My cats love the fact that they can see out all sides. I also really like that you can fit the attachable food dish in the top compartment. I never need to use that but it'd be nice to keep with the container. Also, so much room! You can fit a pretty big cat in this thing. Worth the price especially since I'm going to have cats the rest of my life :)",5
"This works for keeping my dog from begging at the table. It's humane and just startles him enough to where I just place it beside me and and behaves. I don't even have to press it. It's a sharp hissing sound, just like the compressed air can you clean keyboards with.",5
Good price and a must have product.,5
I stretch the holes a bit to put pieces of jerky treats inside this (and other JW products) to distract my dogs and keep them busy when I'm leaving!,5
"Excellent. Beautiful feathers. My cat FiFI flipped over backwards for these lil gems. She also loved that each one had a bell. I've ordered other replacements that were un-natural. These feathers were natural and she happily put them in her mouth and ""killed"" her prey. All around good buy.

***This is the second time I've purchased these feathers for FIFI. She tugs so hard at them that she literally pulls the feather apart from the spinner. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent product. My cat is just strong. She then has killed her prey. I love ordering from The Natural Pet Company. Excellent customer service and supreme products!",5
It was great for quality and timeliness but my dog never wanted to use it or took interest in it. I took it down after trying to get her to use it for two months.,4
I use this almost daily while shopping.  Very happy ith purchase,5
My cat likes it so I'm happy,5
"I also bought the doggy toothpaste and although my dog isn't fond of this, I lure him in with the toothpaste (which he loves) and then quickly clean his teeth. And then he gets an apple slice as a reward.
This works well, but don't forget to wet it first!",5
Well constructed and I love the bright design.,5
My Patty can't wait for her morning Treats!!!!,5
I have a grain free Chi who happens to be a thousand years old and kind of picky. He loves this food! I never have a problem getting him to eat it,5
Best ever!  Puppies love it.,5
"Bought for my mom's Chihuahua as a gift. Fits nicely, no complaints. Received when expected. I got him the small in sky blue, looks adorable. I got it a couple months ago and it's holding up very well considering he is a very active dog with lots of energy. Overall very satisfied.",5
Bought this for a household of three dogs.  I absolutely love the fact that the water only drains into the bowl as it needs to so they are not drinking nasty water.  Some say the bubbling startles their animals but I have not had that problem.,5
I recently ran out of API water conditioner and had to use the Aqueon Tap Water Conditioner that came with my aquarium kit. It seems to work fine. I usually use 1 or 2 drops of conditioner for each gallon of water in the tank. When I am doing water changes and have to let water sit for 24 hours before cycling water out of the tank I usually use one or two drops per gallon as well. So yes I use this product and would recommend it to anyone setting up an aquarium.,5
adorps,3
"played with briefly because it was new and has since been ignored.  I can assure you that has never happened with an antler.  additionally antler provides great nutrients.

Don't recommend",2
Yields NO odor. Extraordinary! We've added baking soda and other odor suppressants to other liters. NO comparisons. Don't know why this is sooo effective. Try it only once. This will prove to yourself what I'm saying. Really a big surprise,5
"This device works to stop my dog from barking at strangers. At some point her seeing the device is enough to prevent or stop the bark. If I show it to her daily, she is very good with not barking. But if she hasn't seen it for awhile, she may bark again at which point I show it to her or use once or twice, and the cycle repeats. Overall, considering that nothing worked before, this is money well spent.",5
"I got these to keep my dog from nipping my smaller dog all the time.  I put them on each dog so I can also use them for barking.  I suggest  you don't use them for more than one or two reasons because it would be too much for the dog to understand and it would be frustrated when the collar is put on.  The remote could be better.  It turns off so soon that each time I want to use it I have to turn it on and by then the dog has already nipped or barked.  I want it available all the time so the minute I see my dog doing wrong I can correct it.
Otherwise this is a very nice unit.  It does a good job.",4
My dog loves these!,5
It worked very well and loved the kit and assortment of blade lengths.,5
"Good filters, easy to install.",5
"this is the fanciest seat cover i've ever owned! they have a non skid back that works well. but most importantly, someone was smart enough to put these pvc pipe type things on the side that meets the seat and you just shove that in to the crack between the bottom and the back of the chair (where the seat belt usually comes out of) and it stays put! who would have thunk it! its a really thick and heavy material. i haven't had any problems with the snaps and i really hope i don't because i like this thing a lot",5
"Hens love it.  Didn't last long enough, though.",5
This sponge filter is nice. It's just the right size to use in my ten gallon tank and it was super easy to install. Just clean the glass well and stick it on. Then plug the air hose onto it. All done. The sponge is removable to rinse off when it gets crudy. The vent is adjustable and slides up and down easily so you can set it to your water level.,5
We have been using this cat litter for a few months and we really like it.  It doesn't have a strong smell.  Easy to scoop out and doesn't fall apart like some of the other cat litter we have tried.  We have two cats and they seem to like it too!,5
"The phrase ""you are what you eat"" applies to dogs as well, so its important to provide food with real nutrition and made from real ingredients, not 'byproducts'.",5
"This crate is very attractive. I get many compliments on it. We have been using it for 6 months as an end table. My dog loves it, but he is also over 3 years old and loves his crate.
Now, for the bad news. The crate came and the wood was slightly warped, so it went together with some difficulty. the notches did not like up perfectly. I wanted to send it back, but it was too much work to package it up and send it back. It is wobbly, but not terribly so. It is more the point that if I spend a good amount of money, I expect the parts to be perfect. My bad is that I never contact the company.
The last negative thing is that one day about a month ago, my dog was over excited to get out of his crate and blew right through the pretty latch. It just popped right off. My son smahsed it back into the hole and so far, it has held.
Overall, I would have given this 4 or 5 stars if the wood was not warped upon arrival. I am considering purchasing another for my second dog.",3
"Im shooting from the hip because I live in Hawaii and have not needed to even use this. It could be horrible, who knows?",4
A nice quick on the road feed.,5
cat approves. My husband on the other hand doesnt. He got stuck putting it together!,5
Great product,5
"Neither of my cats, one who is a fuss-pot & the other who'll eat  practically Anything, will Touch this stuff.  Even the smell of the chicken broth/juice/gravy doesn't seem to appeal to either of them.  I'm really surprised & disappointed because I had high hopes for this canned cat food since I've read so much good stuff about Tiki Cat & now I'm stuck with a case of perfectly good chicken that could almost be used in chicken salad!  I think the problem might be that it seems to be cooked chicken breast meat - very stringy & apparently tasteless to a cat!!",2
"Good shirt. The first one i ordered had torn stitching but after contacting the company, they fixed the issue. Good design.",4
Our finicky cat loves this!,5
"Great brand, love the ingredients and most importantly my dogs love it.",5
Returned due to not being able to fully submerge.,3
Just what I wanted for my puppies. . And getting 3 toys with this price is really good.. I mean in a local store I will find one toy for the same price of this 3..,5
Seems to help my dogs paws and keeps them soft and protected.,5
Best cat toy ever.  Older cat can't get enough of it...now she leaves us alone at night!!,5
"Didn't work! They replaced the first one,  sent another,  and even the 2nd one didn't work.  Very frustrating.  I tried different bulbs and different outlets with no luck. They did refund me and charge a ""restocking fee"". Will not but again.",1
Very well constructed doggie toy.  My two 70 lb. German Short-hair Pointers love to chase and catch it mid-air.  They also play tug of war....  It's amazingly durable.,5
"This was so easy to pop up & click the top rails into place.  I've been airing it out in a spare bedroom, in front of a window, because it has a peculiar smell.  This is the 3rd day of the 'air out' & the smell is almost gone now.  Not sure what that was about.  32 inch fits my 50 lb bull terrier with a little room to spare.  I'm surprised by the one reviewer who said her dog likes to sleep on TOP of this crate.  It is durable enough for casual use (a dog who wants out could easily tear out of this) but I am impressed that the frame of this could hold up to a medium sized dog sleeping on top of it - I would not have guessed that.  My dog likes to be in his metal/ wire crate, but I wanted something easy to carry/ set up quick to take in & out of my petsitters, when I want my dog to rest (& keep him from getting into trouble when she leaves the house).  My dog is older now & not as energetic, but in his younger days, he could have easily chewed/ ripped his way out of this.  He won't do that now.  I think he will like the 'den like' effect that this crate provides with the covered sides.  He will feel secure & comfortable in it with a dense memory foam pad in the bottom.  And I will be able to take him more places now (where he would normally need to be contained) - this will make that so easy.  Perfect for my needs!  Got it at a great price too.  Hope it holds ups!  Seems like it will.",5
"My cats go nuts for these treats. All I have to do is get the bag out and they are running to me. I feel good giving these to them as there's no ""junk"" fillers. It's real food.",5
"Perfect amount of light for my 29 gallon aquarium. The suction cups are great and allow for many ways to arrange the light. I've got it stuck to the inside of the glass lid pointing down. Floats really well. And according to the box it uses only 4 watts, so it's pretty energy efficient.",5
"Marshall ferret litter is the best I have found.  No dust and it absorbs well and keeps odor down.

Marshall ferret products are the best I have found overall.",5
"These are great! My finches love them and they fit perfectly on the cage door opening! Easy to clean, don't leak, and sturdy. I love the little piece that holds the door up. The last bird bath I bought before these was horrible. Didn't fit any doors either.",5
Very nice dual purpose collar and very attractive as well.,5
Saved the Day for some little newborn kittens whose mother abandoned them.,5
It is helping to contain the litter mess.,4
Plastic; a little flimsy but will get the job done.  Just not too sure how long they will actually last.,2
"Awesome, the bungee are not great, break easily.  Had to replace them.",5
"We have a 6 pound chihuahua-maltese-yorkie mix...in other words a little mutt.

We wanted a well-made and tough looking harness for Chewbacca...the fearless leader of the galaxy!

The XS fits Chewie very well with a little extra play so it's not too tight. He didn't like it at first (most dogs don't) but he was fine after a couple days.

The buckle and d-rings look a bit out of place on such a small harness but they work well and provide with a handle of sorts to pick Chewie when needed. The reflective areas are a nice safety feature.

All-in-all, it's an excellent harness that fits well. Be sure to take accurate measurements. Chewie is very small at 6 pounds and the XS harness is just  perfect. The XS will be too big on any dog smaller than Chewie.

Pics added to show the how cute our mutt is!",5
My puppy absolutley LOVES these antlers. You can't beat the price and the quality of it. It has no smell and it keeps my puppy busy and has kept her from chewing things she's not suppose to. This is my second time buying this product so that she can have multiple antlers around the house.  Will be buying more in the future. AWESOME product I highly recommend it!,5
"Not sure if they really worked or I just really wanted them to but, they did seem to calm our Pekingese. They are a bit pricey but, they did seem to work.",4
I love this!!!!  I have two cats and was sick and tired of constantly walking on litter.  It did take the cats a couple of weeks to get used to it but now....it's the best thing ever!!!,5
I expected a kong toy to last longer in my house with 2 large dogs. Still only certain toys that can survive more than a day or two and this was not one.,3
This was too small for my needs but it was just as they said.  Seemed expensive for what it was.,3
"Most harnesses that I have purchased have been more complicated than necessary.  The ""Puppia"" is easy to use and most likely very comfortable for the dog in my life.",5
Our senior cat finally got a break in her life.  Her constipation is gone and she is so happy now to go to her litter box and she never poops on the carpet any more.  This cat food really saved our senior cat and made the rest of her life comfortable and great!  We wish we switched to this cat food sooner so Mashka (our cat) did not have to suffer the years she had constipation.,5
"I like how easy it is to put on and take off, but my dog doesn't like it because she can't see through it.  Although to be honest, she didn't do too well with the translucent cone that I got her either.  My dog hasn't been going after the incision site, so I leave the cone off when I am watching her and I put it back on when I go out or go to sleep, so it's nice how easy it is to take on and off.  She is getting used to it.  Looks more comfortable to sleep in than the plastic one.",5
Fit crate perfect,4
"Buyer beware. This toy is terribly dangerous for animals. I just pulled one out of the package and both ends have very sharp points to them. I checked the rest, they are all the same. Also, it's easy for pieces to break off. Do not get for kitty as it is far from safe.",1
I had my dog at an outdoor event where we were wetting them down to keep cool. Mine was the only dog that was sudsy because this is essentially soap. I don't like it much.,2
My elder husky and I are just starting to explore the wonderful world of dog incontinence and my veterinarian suggested I try Royal Canin.  We are in the early stages and my dog still has the problem but she loves her new food.  It arrived on time and in good shape.  Thank you.,5
"....wish they weren't so expensive as i would buy them more frequently.  i have 6 dogs & i cut these up in thirds with wire cutters just to make them last longer.  these are the best chew item & keeps the dogs entertained, cleans their teeth, which prevents bad doggy breath also.  will be ordering some more soon.  please make them more affordable.",5
Bristles are too far apart. Does not work well for short-haired cat.,2
"I love my Biorb tanks, but the parts and filter packs are wayyy

overpriced. The 8 bucks shipping was ridiculous for two foam aristones that weighed less than an ounce and cost 6 bucks. I now adapt readily

available off the shelf foam air diffusers with some tubing pieces and they only cost about 2 dollars for a four pack.",2
"The clip gets jammed in the slot, takes time and pliers to pull it out, doing this repeatly ruins the snap clip. The gentle leader is a good concept, however the product is cheaply made and fails to satisfy my needs.",1
"This last of Frontier Catnip was a huge disappointment.  It wasn't, at all, the product I thought I was getting (based on the description and picture) and certainly not the product I have purchased through Amazon, many times.  This last bag came as finely ground dust.  My cats -- who like to eat the ""cut leaf"" catnip -- nibble at this a bit, but then walk away.  I know they don't like it (much).  I'm an idiot for not returning it, but the last time I returned Frontier Catnip (because it was freezer-burned) -- sold by a different vendor... I think -- it was such a hassle, I didn't want to go through it again.  I don't know what else to say -- I'm truly disappointed.... and such an idiot!  :/",1
"I like this and had high hopes for it. I like modern decor and I won't have a carpeted old style cat climber scratcher in out house. I love the style of this. The cats like it. They play and lounge on it exactly as shown.

Alas, I'm only going to give it a 3 because:

1 - it's expensive. $49 down from $99 for something that will last 3 months? Yikes. I'm hoping to get a year out of it.

2 - the inside loops are small. My average sized 8 lb cats can't fit inside or though it. They try and then get stuck and then avoid it. Our 3 lb kitten loves the loops and think it's great. He's always on the inside of it sleeping and playing. I wish the 2 older cats could also do that.",3
My dogs love this dog treat.,5
"I adopted an abused and starved golden retriever puppy from the local instant kill shelter.  The puppy was very fearful, ran from me, and barked constantly. I tried everything - puppy classes (12 sessions), canned air (supposed to sound like snake and scare them to stop), shock collar (I felt too bad to use more than level 1 so he didn't even respond), and several other items.  It took only one day with three gentle taps of the Pet Parade Dog Repeller and he no longer barks.  I am thrilled with the results and I'm sure my neighbors are too.  This is the best product I have discovered in years.",5
Love this! it works really well. my new kitten loves it!,5
Good toothbrush. It's small and fits well in my dogs mouth!,3
Seems exceptionally hardy.  My dog is very happy with it.,5
Terrible cap!  Doesn't screw on well at all so it takes forever to get it on.  And you better get it on right or you've got water everywhere when you flip it over.  Ridiculousness.,1
"My cats love it.  My vet recommended it specifically for my boy cat, Iggy.  Iggy is an older fellow, and tended to have problems with his ability to pee.  If your male cat starts to pee in funny places (Iggy chose the bathtub and bathmats rather than the box) it could be a sign that he is having a UTI (urinary tract infection).  We went through several bouts of pink antibiotic forced down kitty`s throat only to have the same problem 6 months later.

Shifting all 3 kitties to this kibble has given us years between relapses for Mr. Iggy.  His last relapse caused us to keep water bowls in several rooms as the girls are now bigger and would chase him away if they were in that area.  Not enough fluids and you get a sick cat.",5
Did nothing for my dogs paw. I did make a huge mess though! I just put a sock on it and waited.,1
"Great lid, fit my 40 gallon breeder aquarium perfectly and can hold up to three cats on top (maybe more we only have three).",5
Barkley loves these and I like the low calorie.,5
"I really love this sweater! The XL fit my 35 pound collie mix perfectly! My only compliant is that the arm holes were a bit snug, I had to stretch them out as best as I could to give him a little more room in the arm area. Thankfully they stretched out enough and I didn't have to cut a little slit. The quality of the sweater is great and I love the design. :) Overall, very pleased!!",4
Quick delivery. Too heavy though. Too many in one box at a time.,5
This is a good quality item considering its cost.,5
"Dog absolutely loved these and unlike Greenies or other similar products, these Z-bones actually lasted him awhile. The large size would take him maybe ten or fifteen minutes to finish, which gave me a nice little break from puppy training at work every once in awhile.

However, they are pricey for the number of bones you get, so I won't be buying these on the regular (unlike Zuke's Minis or Zuke's Supers). Still, they're a good once-in-a-blue-moon treat that my dog enjoys.",4
Items always arrived well packed and in a timely manner.  Great product.  My cat loves it!,5
Used this for my parrot's perches. Held up well. Great price.,5
"These are small and easy HIGH reward treats.  Will order frequently!  In fact, I should probably go ahead and do so now!",5
"one of the best  rain boots - kept my dog paws dry and clean, also very easy to put on and take off.",5
"This dish is a good stainless steel dish of very high quality, which is why I give it 5 stars.  That said, a) the medium is *way* too big for a medium-sized dog - at least one with a head shaped like our dog's, which is a typical Cocker Spaniel size and shape, and b) even the correctly-sized one (a small) does not really slow down our dog enough to deal with the throwing up from eating too fast - it's pretty easy to just scarf up the food in a circular fashion.

So, we personally went with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brake-Fast-Dog-Food-Slow-Feed-Bowl/dp/B000S6XSA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brake-Fast Dog Food Slow Feed Bowl</a>&nbsp;(in the *small* size, their medium is way too big too - you can read my review of that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B000S6XSA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>), and that has worked *beautifully*.

Now, *that* said, the Brake-Fast bowl is plastic, and this bowl here is a very nice stainless steel, so if that is important to you, then this one is a fine bowl *if* it slows your dog down enough.

Oh, another tip - we were told to switch him to a kibble with lower fat and protein to help with the throwing up, and since switching to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FirstMate-Pet-Foods-Pacific-Ocean-Fish-Senior-Weight-Control/dp/B000WAC1K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FirstMate Pet Foods Pacific Ocean Fish Senior/Weight Control</a>&nbsp;dog food (which we did at the same time as getting the Brake-Fast bowl) he hasn't thrown up at all! (Knock on wood.)",5
Works Fantastic! Great Quality! Highly Recommend this for any dog trainers!,5
"My dogs do well on this food.  They're not athletes and don't need protein into the 40% range, so this is a grain free line with a nice balance.  Stool consistency is good, no stomach upset... all around, very pleased.  Great for the price.",5
Its good very good,5
Shipped fast and it works really well for my fountain.  I have cats and dogs and they drink from it without any problems.,5
My dog who enjoys puzzle toys really liked this food ball.  I only cut two of the tabs on one end of the ball so that the kibble won't fall out all at once.  It took him almost a half hour to get his food out.  The only thing I don't like is that he cna't pick up the ball with his mouth because it's big and made of hard plastic (he's a newfoundland with a big mouth).  He would have liked this food ball even more if he was able to pick it up like the kong toys that he loves.  usually when his toys get stuck somewhere he just picks it up and moves to another place but this ball kept getting stuck and he could only paw at it.  Otherwise i't fun and gets him really interested in his food.,4
"MY CAT LOVES BLUE FOOD. ALL NATURAL, HEALTY AND NOT FILLED WITH BY PRODUCTS AND HARMFUL CHEMICALS. ITS EXPENSIVE BETTER MUCH BETTER THEN THE OTHER STUFF OUT THERE.",5
"This product sounds stupid, but it's my cats favorite toy. It's also easy on YOU since you can just hold it and the wire does the work. I even set mine up under the TV so it holds itself up and he still loves it.",5
I could never actually get this laser to move by itself and the cats got bored just staring at a stationary laser,2
"I'm not sure exactly what the chew guard does because my dog would have chewed this up in about five minutes if I let him. He is an average chewer - has not made it through the red Kong but certainly tears apart stuffed animals. This toy is probably good for dogs who... nibble on their toys normally. Not sure what dog that is but it isn't mine! Go with Tuffy for something that lasts.

On the other hand, my dog LOVED the toy. The squeaky is fun and the toy IS Cute just not durable.",3
"""Large"" size is just a bit large for our 21 lb Miniature Schnauzer but acceptable. It goes over his head almost too easily, but the chest strap seems to hold the harness in place very well. His previous ""step through"" harness fit well enough but he learned to back out of it when under leash and asked to do something he did not want to do!  So far he has not been able to do that with this harness. I don't believe he can, this harness covers more of his body, but appears comfortable, he seems quite happy with it.",5
Bought this based upon fact that it is safe for guinea pigs.  The bag is very big for price and was happily surprised that it was mixed w/paper product....so seems more comfortable for piggies than straight shavings.  I have a large cage for 2 piggies and this uses approximately 3/4 of the bag each time.,4
"The busy buddy is a great toy but not as interesting without these replacement rings.... keeps my Jack Russell entertained, Cocker Spaniel not so much!",5
"This is one of about 30 toys we have bought for our 8 and 10 week old miniature dachshund puppies and it is hands-down their favorite. In fact, we purchased a second one, they love it so much. I don't know how long it will hold up but it will immediately be replaced if it bites the dust. They play individually with them but tug of war is their favorite use of this awesome toy. Don't know why this particular one is so much cheaper than almost identical toys but we aren't complaining. As a bonus, there are no buttons, small pieces (except the tiny horns which we cut off) , or other dangerous parts to choke a small puppy.",5
Wonderfully detailed. Its a real eye catcher in my indoor garden..love it..Thanks again,5
Lasted a long time and just as I expected. Great service and product,5
"Another favorite for my cat.  She loves it, along with the Curable Cat Scratcher Lounge.  She is on one of them constantly.  It is sturdy and looks like it will last a long time.",5
These bags are great. Have never ripped on me and are the perfect size. I love that they're compostable too. Great scent as well.,5
"Setup took less than 5 minutes; just follow the directions included. Took my corgi once to learn to go up and down (give lots of praise when they do it and they'll know how to do it again!). It's the perfect height for my Malm bed from Ikea. Seemed pretty easy and comfortable for my corgi to use it, so I would assume that any other dog with short legs like his would find it easy to use :).

Update: My corgi still uses this to get onto the couch and my bed; It's so easy for him to use (and he's been growing, so even as he gets longer and larger this has been easy to use) that I purchased a second one. Super easy assembly and easy to use!",5
"I bought the larger version, but the tennis balls are a bit big for my little Pom.  I love the mini Chuckit! balls, but the launcher is small than I expected and the short length makes it difficult to use.  I usually end up chucking it into the ground in front of me, but I'm starting to get the hang if it.  I would suggest going with the larger one, easier to use and launches farther.",3
Dual doors keeps 100 degree summer out of house. My dogs were use to one door but they easily adapted two the dual door design. Highly recommend!,5
"When I first presented this to my puppy, she jumped on and right off again.  She didn't want to get back on, so I put it away for a few months.  I recently pulled it out again and now she loves it.  I have a soft rug on top of it, and she lays on it all the time.  It folds up nicely, which makes it great for transport.  A nice and very reasonably priced purchase.",5
Do not buy this unless it's for a tiny dog! I got this for my lab puppy and it's way too small. I'm nervous my older lab is going to grab it and choke. This product is a joke.,1
Doesn't smell bad and my dogs seem to like it just fine.  The pump makes this super convenient too!,5
"I first bought this at my local market a few weeks ago.  The long lasting thing is why I tried it.  I'm busy and can't always clean the litter on a daily basis.  It's not as dusty as some of the other litters I've used, though there is some cloud when pouring, but it's tolerable.  The smell, I barely notice, then again, I'm used to litters that leave a remarkable stench in some I've tried that cling to the cats and make cuddle time suffocating; this is one of the better ones.  I've noticed that it takes about 3 days with my two cats for an odor to appear...
The first time I used it, I had half a fill of Scoop Away left so I mixed it in, so I haven't had a chance to experience  only this litter.  Given my experience with it this far, it's been one of my favorites.  A regular size box of it cost me $8.99 and, in my opinion, is totally worth it.  No problems breathing, Panther and Figaro seem to like it, so I'm quite satisfied with this product!",4
"I am a huge believer in probiotics so I was excited to try these treats for my dog.  I was disappointed when they arrived as they looked broken.  I opened the bag and as you can see from the photo, they were crumbled and broken into little bits.  These are too expensive to arrive in such a condition.  I think the manufacturer needs to look at quality control and perhaps a different packaging system.  I only received a few of the 60 treats that are usable.

I found one that was still whole and offered it to my dog.  She resisted at first and spit it out onto the floor, but then she changed her mind and ate it off the floor.  So, I'm happy that my dog will eat them.  I will use the crumbs to sprinkle over her food.  But I will not be purchasing these again.  I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",2
My cat's fur is shinny & no dry skin (dander).  I squeeze the liquid on top of a few of her treats and she loves it! Thank You!,5
My dogs love these and they seem to help keep them calm for a few hours.,5
"I thought my cat would love this toy, but she mostly just ignores it.  I find I'm spending more time fishing things in and out of the holes than she does.  It is well-made and would last for years if your cat enjoys it.",2
"Works, close enought",5
"Leonardo played with this bone less then 5 minutes and the squeaker busted!  I am so disappointed, that was a waste of money. He brings me the bone like I came make it squeak again. You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves! ",1
"This is a beautiful, soft, exquisitely made rug.  The colors are brilliant, quality superb.  I bought because I needed a lovely rug for my Golden Retriever, either a food mat, or a rug to place beside my bed.  Regrettably, this rug is a bit too small for a sleeper rug and too big for a food mat.  I thought Sunny, my dog, would curl up on it and be happy.  Dog gone it, she won't.  I'm stuck with a giant dog bed beside my bed for her, and an ugly rubber food mat.  So, that being said, I still highly recommend it.  Just make sure you measure the space where you would like to use it for a food mat, or figure out how picky your dog is about what kind of rugs/beds it prefers.  I still have to send it back because it won't work for us, it doesn't mean it won't work for you.  It really is superb.",5
Works great,5
This has greatly improved the litter tracks in my laundry room.  It has caught 95% of litter from my 4 kitties.,5
Our dog really likes these treats. We have her on a wellness core diet so this is a nice addition. A little hard to find in stores. Best price on Amazon with prime. I bought all the flavors.,5
C rating,3
"Really cute, cat's love it. Nice and cozy and soft on the inside. Sometimes they sit on it instead of in it, but cats will be cats.",4
"My very picky little dogs are mad for duck jerky and their mom is glad they're eating lean jerky instead of all the fat and chemical-filled crapola they call dog treats at the grocery.  Most of the people still complaining of ill effects from chicken jerky treats are repeating truly tragic stories from 3 years ago, before US distributors started irradiating them.  If anyone's had a problem with this brand of duck jerky in the last year, I'd love to know because I'd be the first to stop using them.  Until then, YUM, these treats are, paws-down, the favorite of my three healthy bouncy dogs, and have totally knocked chicken treats and pupparoni out of the box for sheer doggie enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, this price (2 lbs for $18) is crazy great especially with Prime (just try buying a 4 oz bag at the grocery).",5
"These are durable chews. I'm not entirely sure they're helping our dog's teeth but he likes them. My complaints are 1) the sizes (thickness, length) can vary greatly and 2) the odor can be a overwhelming. Sometimes it seems like I've stuck my nose in a bag of soured beef bouillon.",3
If my male feline sleeps outside he certainly loves to curl up in this bed  Well made,5
Works great,5
"As far as water conditioners, you just aren't gonna beat Prime. I've had a Pacu for over 20 years, and this stuff has saved his/her life more than once. Let's be clear, technically, it does remove ammonia... but what it really does is convert the toxic ammonia into non-toxic ammonium until the biological filter can consume it. SO, if you use an ammonia test that only tests total (API ammonia test) and not just free, toxic ammonia - you'll get false readings. If you really want to know what your free (toxic) ammonia levels are, I'd suggest the Seachem Ammonia Multi-test and Seachem Ammonia Alert as well.",5
Love these,5
"It says mini but mine was a large, either way great product.",5
Gift to dog rescue group along with a bunch of other items.,3
"It didn't come as was purchased,
We were very disappointed...
Never received the cat nip that was supposed to come with it...
All I got was an empty container...
I even wrote about it on Amazon but NO answer!!",1
easy read,4
"Works very well and greatly reduced the amount of water that gets spilled on the floor.  I got the large size that holds @ 2 gallons  -- the combination of its filled weight and placement in the corner of the kennel area have eliminated the problem that we had with our Airedale deliberately pushing around and spilling her water bowl.  Now the only water that gets on the floor is what drips off her beard.  Although the full container could last her several days, I refill it every couple of days so I can clean the bowl.",5
"Their ad is very deceptive.  It says ""Large"" but most of what came would't qualify as large in anyone's vocabulary.  There were a couple of slabs that might be called Medium but for the most part the product sent consisted of several small tines that would only be appropriate for a Toy dog.  I would be afraid to give them to my larger dogs for fear of choking.  Definitely NOT worth $34.  I will be returning these ASAP!",1
"My 18 year old, finicky cat absolutely loves this food.

I'm so glad to find something healthy that he likes.",5
"I have had a bunch of whisper filters, and I loved every one. Whispers are good filters, one bad review does not a story make, I highly recommend these filters based on thirty years of experience keeping fresh and saltwater reef tanks (but not for reef tanks, they have their own requirements and box filters are not ideal for reefs) For freshwater tanks, these are excellent filters, ok  that's basically it in a nutshell.",5
Easily able to store in treats into the pouch and am able to clip it on my waist.,5
Every little girl should have a vest to break the cool winds...I love it.,5
"Overall, I am happy with this fountain. Since I use it for more cats than I use the regular Premium fountain - I do wonder about the small filter. It is easier to clean - by far - than the Premium fountain. My cats love it.

LM",4
This light is great for growing plants both in and out of an aquarium! At first I used it to grow plants in a 20 gallon aquarium and it did a great job! Probably not bright enough for a system running CO2 but it fulfilled my needs. I now use it to grow a few indoor plants because I don't get much natural light inside. The light itself is quality built out of aluminum and has a plastic shield over the lights to keep water out. It has survived a swim and multiple drops so its definitely durable. I would absolutely purchase this again if I were in need.,5
"My dog developed a severe allergy to fleas when he was staying with my friend in N.C. around the summer of 2004.  I bought supplements and an expensive medical anti-itch shampoo from the vet, which cleared up my dog's dermatitis after a couple of months.  Since the shampoo from the vet was expensive and I wanted to make it last for future flares, I went on a search for a new primary anti-itch shampoo.  That is when I found Bio-Groom Natural Oatmeal shampoo.  I'm not sure what went wrong with the negative reviewer as my 6 yrs. of experience with this product have been excellent.  I found it to be a very gentle shampoo when my dog was experiencing dermatitis.  And it did reduce his itching when the directions were followed.  Lastly, this product also makes his hair nice and soft as mentioned by the other reviewer.",5
"What is there to say about Greenies that hasn't already been said?  I give them to two of my dogs on the weekend and they just love them.  The price I paid here is so much better than the brick and mortar stores.  I typically buy the 36oz size, Petite, 60 count  it comes in two zip locked bags, 30 count in each.  A final note, I never leave my dogs alone when they have chews.  Good quality and price.",5
"I bought this for our little 10lb. ""foster fail"". She's a foster fail because I fell in love with her and had to adopt her myself! LOL. I put it on her when we take both dogs out on the boat with us - just in case something were to happen. I also put it on her if I take her swimming in the lake. She loves to paddle around while I hold on to the handle to guide her.",5
"Well, my dog gets two of these per day and so far, so good. I don't notice a real difference in her since I think it's too soon but, I'll stay with it till the bottle is gone and in the mean time, I'm assuming it's doing her good. I puncture the pill and squeeze out the oil very easily without any mess and it doesn't smell strong. She eats it up without hesitation. I'm happy with this product as it does seem like high quality stuff.",4
My cats like this very much and I do too,5
"Great item, your dog will truly love it..",5
these harnesses are great.  I struggled for a long time to find a harness that did not eventually choke my shih tzu.  I bought 2 sizes. larger for when he has clothes on and smaller when he is in the buff!  easy to put on,5
Can't walk my dog without it! I love this product. Effective and gentle!,5
"So much easier for ""we elders"" than carrying bags in from the store.",5
"I really like the idea of elevating the water bowl in the kennels of my three dogs. My rambunctious and independent Yorkie has a fun time making huge messes for me to clean up after he takes a bath in his water bowl. I bought these to try out and for the most part, I really like them. They are easy to attach to the door of the kennel and hold a decent amount of water. My biggest issue is how difficult it is to remove the bowl. I imagine this is to keep a dog from yanking it off, but I often can't get it off without making a mess.  They do snap back into place relatively easy - it is getting them off that is difficult. Overall, I am really happy with the purchase and have three of them.",4
wonderful little toy and great price,5
Best purchase I made for my very chewy lab mix puppy. Buy this product.  It is great!!!!,5
"Be careful with this. I have long haired cats, and it made them very greasy . . . won't buy it again. Although I will buy Hills Science Diet, Regular, again.",3
Love it!,5
"I read all the reviews and I am glad this seems to work so well for others, however for my dogs (three dogs) I do not see a significant change.  My pitbull becomes very stressed during thunderstorms.  I have given these to her many times, and in the end, I have to give her a prescription tranquilizer to calm her.",3
"Other than tennis balls, this is my border collie's favorite toy. Can have it as an indoor toy as it is soft and does not harm furniture as she walks around with it. She knows this simply as her ""frisbee"".
Worth the cost. Buy 2 - one for in, 1 for out! Fun for little games of tug of war, keep away, fetch, basic exercise, etc.",5
great food as always,5
Holds up well!  Is a great leash!,5
We have five cats and they love this fountain.  Healthy kidneys!,5
does work,5
"Works as its suppose to, bends easier than expected.",3
"If you have a HOB filter, you'll need to secure this in one area of the tank somehow. I used a piece of airline tubing looped through the matt and then stuck both ends under the lid. Aside from that minor flaw, this works great - I cut it in half and put half on the bottom, and the combination of surface and substrate safe hide-outs has saved many little guppy and platy fry in my tank. It's good if you're going for more natural, less stressful births on the mothers - breeding traps will save a lot more fry but really freak the mothers out, I've actually had 2 new mothers die in those, while none have died if I just let them give birth in the tank with breeding grass.",4
Lasted less than 30 minutes with a large dog.  Had to make sure to gather the piece so the dog would not swallow them.,2
"Best cat tower deal! The cat's LOVE the hammock, and the nest!",5
My dog is elderly and incontinent and if I don't use this the grout in the tile where she sleeps will hold the smell. It does what it states.,5
"My dog loves this. You might have to be careful with a really destructive dog tearing it up, but mine has played with it well.",5
"These smelled good and seemed fresh, but my guinea pigs wouldn't touch them.",2
"I purchased this collar for my dog because I hate how stinky nylon collars get, but leather collars seem like they can be a bit uncomfortable.  I have an 80 pound Giant Schnauzer, so I ordered the size Large and it fits perfectly.  She is closely shaven most of the year, so a collar that is not comfortable, especially for a very stubborn dog, is not OK.  (If she's not happy, she's not walking.)  This collar is definitely a big improvement over her old leather collar.

The leather is very soft and it is folded back on itself so there are no rough edges and it is actually kind of cushy.  The leather is very thick and high quality.  The hardware (buckles, etc.) are very sturdy and it's clear nothing is going to break on this collar.  It is very well made.  My only complaint is that it is very heavy.  For my large dog, it's fine, the extra comfort is worth a little extra weight since she is a big mass of muscle and can carry it.  But I don't think I would buy one of these for my 65 pound yellow lab...I think it would be too heavy for her.  Perhaps the next size down would be lighter and have thinner leather....so I dunno....I could be wrong, it might be fine. But if your dog is 70 pounds or less, order a size Medium....which sounds crazy...but I think the Large is truly only for very large dogs 75 pounds and up.  The Large is waaaay too large for my 65 pound Labrador who does not have a thick neck (she's more American style Lab).",5
Great sweatshirt. My dog loves it! Kept him warm during our night walk and during bedtime. Will be getting more colors soon!,5
Have used these for years for our cat with a heart issue.  She loves these and we never have an issue.,5
NICE,5
"Harrison's pellets are pretty much the best bird food ever. The high potency fine is great for your small-medium parrots living in a colder environment. My parrots are healthy, shiny and well-fed thanks to Harrison's... and the fresh fruits and veggies I laboriously chop up into to tiny pieces for them every morning, spoiled brats.",5
Puppy's not really intrested.,3
"My cat from the local shelter was terrified and spent the first day in her carrier.  On Day 2 she tried out her new Armarkat bed but never looked at it again. She heard me ask my son if the shelter would like to have this lovely, barely used bed.  I had set it down in my office, facing out the sliding door so the cat could feel safe but watch birds. Anticipating my son's arrival, I turned the bed around, facing inward. Since then, Jessica has spent hours of every day snoozing in her furry igloo! It makes sense: How could she watch birds and sleep at the same time? The trick now is to teach her NIGHTS are for sleep; DAYS are for galloping through the condo.",5
"I bought this for two very aggressive chewers, one is a 100 lb. German Shepherd. Every toy they have is destroyed except this and one other. So far it doesn't even show much wear and neither does the second one I purchased so they each had they're own.",5
"I love this litter box. My cat started using it right away with no problems. She sometimes kicks the pellets on the floor, but it's much better than tracking litter everywhere. I have to clean it about once a week, which isn't bad. I can imagine having two cats use it might be too much.",5
"Hilariously fun costume. When the dogs run, the cowboy moves like he is riding them. The XL fit my standard poodle perfectly.",5
wish some were thinner and long. you cant let it hang over edges. good otherwise,5
Our Golden Retriever puppy has a shiny healthy coat thanks to the addition of this product to his food twice daily.,4
This product is wonderful!  It has a very fresh scent that's not overpowering.  I have a disabled dog which makes it impossible to bathe him.  I've been looking for something to get him thoroughly clean and this is it.  I highly recommend this!,5
"We were eagerly awaiting the walkydog's arrival and were happy to find it on our porch this morning.
It took me a little bit longer than five minutes to set up but this was a matter of my bike seat being loose. Fixed that and it seems to work ok and doesnt hit me in tbe back of the leg as some people have complained about.
Our dog is a 10 month old german shepherd labrador mix. He is on the smaller side for those breeds weighing only 50 lbs and 23"" at the withers.
When attaching the walky to my dog via the d ring on his harness I only needed to remove 1 spring. Unfortunately, he seems to have outgrown his harness and I was afraid it would chaif the back of his front legs, so we didn't test run him with the harness.
With his regular collar attached, we only needed 1 spring out. This was a BRIEF trial run. Only a few houses down he started barking and lunging at neighbor dogs, and I quickly realized that I was not comfortable with his ability to pull me. Im 120 lbs so maybe this wouldnt be a problem for a 200 lb male, but I didn't feel safe.
My only option at this point was to put his face harness on him. He never pulls with his halti on. I am currently loose leash training him with a regular collar but use the halti to keep him from being able to pull me when walking him into dog parks. I felt completely safe when using the face harness and did not feel as though he would have any problems as he didn't pull in the least.
To attach the face harness I had to take 2 springs outs. This gives him more slack and yet I had no issues with him running into my bike or the trailer carrying my 2 kiddos.
Ive read that a 15 minute bike ride is equivalent to an hour walk, and counts as strenuous activity for working breeds.
My dog is konked out. We went around the block and came back for water and he laid down to drink it. I tried to leave him home while I went to the corner store with my kids. He wasn't havin that. I quickly reattached him and took it slow, staying in the shade on the way as much as possible.
I cant believe that a little bike ride tired him out so much. Im afraid the heat may have contributed, its 78 degrees (hot for where i live) so I will wait for him to become his normal spazz self again and take him out at night or early morning when its cool, and see if it still does the trick then.
I would give this 5 stars if i felt that he was unable to knock me off balance when he lunges with his neck collar or harness attached. Otherwise a great product that hopefully allows me to regain sanity and not have everything left in my yard destroyed (trees and bushes included)",4
"This toy has survived 1 week already, zero punctures.",5
"I bought this along with the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box. They work AWESOMELY together. Litter box cleaning is a breeze.

Pros:
*No smell. Ever.
*The foot pedal makes everything so easy. I just step one the pedal and dump the tray from the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box.
*The bag system is super smart. Everything you need to change the bag is already in the bin, including the blade to cut the bag and the next bag! (Cut away the old bag, and tie up the bottom for the next one.)",5
I bought it to heat the water in the chicken water trough.  I have not had a chance to use it yet.,3
ok,4
"I'm 5'2"" and the taller of my two pups hits right at my hip.  I have a wonderful bungee leash that I used when I ran with a single dog but it is about 48"" long so if I use that plus a coupler (to run with two dogs), it's just too long and gets tangled.  I bought this to use with a coupler since it still has the bungee part which is so handy when !!Squirrel!! but is short enough that it doesn't drag or get tangled.  It works perfectly fine for this purpose.  I've had it a week or two now.  I have 140 lbs of dogs and there have been no quality issues.  Like my other bungee leash, I assume this one will stretch out over time but will still retain some elasticity.  I've also used this directly with one dog and no coupler.  Since I'm short and my dogs are fairly tall, this works much better than having the longer leash, especially now that my dogs have calmed down a little bit and don't pull so much during a run.",5
The mouse is smaller than I expected. Other than that it's fine. My cats don't really like it but the raccoons do ... So there you go lol,4
"My pugs love these bones, they go absolutely nuts for them. It's a good gum massage and they aren't very messy or leave a residue on the couch where the doggies ate them.",5
"Lovely, big and chubby shrimp. They're very healthy and active. My sweet small school of tetras hang and watch the shrimp motor all over the aquarium, cleaning up the bottom of the tank, peering into nooks and crannies, and doing what shrimp do. Wonderful seller. Have ordered from them several times.",5
Liked it so well we bought 2,5
The size of this crate is really the only positive.  It arrived in an undamaged box but we still found the crate bent in numerous places making it very difficult to assemble.  The hooks that hold the sides to the bottom also seem to be a possible hazard.  We had to use several zip ties to close the corners securely and to pull together one of the wires that had broken away.,1
"iked it very much glad I ordered it
Thanks",5
Good product,5
"Quality better than expected.  Seems like solid construction and cats use it with balls and other items & treats. You have to sit down with them and move the balls etc which is actually a good thing as you're interacting with your fur babies.  It works well for my problem kitten (sick, depressed and 'no personality') which I'm particularly grateful for. One big disappointment was that the box arrived with 1 side open and the balls had all fallen out through the toy's holes on that side. I had to reorder the balls as I didn't want the hassle with returning and such (plus I liked the toy).  I bought the biggest bag of balls I found on Amazon which was wise as the balls end up quickly under and behind stuff.  If the balls had come with the toy, I would have given this 5 stars.",4
great product at a great price and fast shipping,5
This lasted about 10 min,2
"The consistency is not my cats' favorite. Instead of a yummy liquid gravy for them to lick up, the liquid in the can meshes with the egg to make a pasty mayonnaise kind of sauce that covers everything. My cats will still eat this, but they seem to prefer having more liquid gravy with their wet foods.",4
Thought it would be a bit more bouncy and fun.  Hard to play with in yard due to it blending with the grass so well.,3
My two Beagles love these. They are perfect size.,5
"First off, let me just say we spoil our dog.  I'm sure most people do.  For our little Maltese, we've tried a variety of dental chews.  His favorite treats are Greenies.

After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...

We've tried all kinds.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zuke-s-Z-Ridge-Mini-Fresh-Breath-Dental-Chew-Bones-15-Count-Pouch/dp/B001MWRT0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Naked-Low-Calorie-Dental-Chew-Sticks-for-Dogs-Small-6-2-Ounce-18-sticks-Pack/dp/B003AYL9NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/N-Bone-Oral-Hygine-Twistix-Twested-Stick-Dog-Treats-Small-5-5-oz/dp/B000WFLONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">N - Bone Oral Hygine Twistix Twested Stick Dog Treats Small 5.5 oz</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Buffalo-Mini-Blue-Bones-Natural-Dog-Dental-Chews/dp/B004BZQB8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Buffalo Mini Blue Bones Natural Dog Dental Chews</a>.  Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.",5
saved my kitty from our bully's attention:-),5
"I have used several brands of poop bags over the last couple of years and I like these best.  I live in an apartment and need to use bags everyday.  These have perfect perforation for easy tearing off the roll, they are eco friendly and priced very fairly.  I've paid a lot more for other brands - the worst being bags on board, which do not tear easily off the roll, sometimes tearing the bag making it useless, and they are way more expensive.
I highly recommend these bags, both for price and ease of use.",5
This was an OK Toyota OK price I was just disappointed that we didn't get the color I thought at first it was the whole set and then I just came in to some random color that was OK.,3
I just started using this product in my reef tank. My hope it that it will help my SPS growth. I will write more in 3-6 months and let you know if it actually seems to have a positive effect.,4
"My pugs prefer these bones over absolutely anything.  My little pug will do *anything* for a one of these ""treats.""  All I do now is say ""Do you want a treat?""  and she knows what's coming.  She'll back out of whatever mess she's getting into a be the perfectly behaved pug - until she's finished the treat- and then we're at it again.  If I remember correctly, these are one of the very few doggie treats that are made in the USA.  With all the recalls coming from China- and dog deaths as a result of that- I only give US made doggie treats.",5
Great sling for our new puppy!,5
"Washes out easily and is gentle on their skin.  I a long-haired and a short-haired dog, and it works well for both of them.  Good value for the price, too!",5
These collars are HUGE. I have Jack Russells and they are MUCH too large. The collars would fit a Saint Bernard. It would have been nice to see a SIZE BEFORE ordering.,1
My 8-month-old dog and 3-month-old foster puppy both love this wishbone. It's great for them to chew and they even play tug of war with it. The regular size is great for small and medium dogs. I'm planning on buying the Wolf size since my dog is growing fast and needs something larger.,5
I LOVE this leash!!! It is thicker and feels stronger than our last leash. The second handle on the leash is at the perfect position. Both handles are comfortable to hold onto due to the padding. I highly recommend this leash.,5
cool box. wide and deep. That said. Only lift by the handle when empty. The top does lock strong and will come off.,4
"Does its job, however it looks so much smaller in the picture than it does in person. I have this for my 2.5 gallon tank, and it looks very noticeable -- I hid it behind a coral insert to make it less of an eyesore. It's not very ""mini"" as it suggests in the name. Four stars because it does its job, -1 for the size.",4
"This harness was a great buy!  My frenchie pulls a bit on her leash and her old harness put most of the pressure on her chest so she'd end up with red little rashes on her chest.  This harness is so soft and doesn't put pressure anywhere on her at all.

I wasn't sure about her size so ordered both an XL and L.  Her measurements were 15 inches around the neck and 23 inches around her chest.  Her neck measurement ended up being borderline between the two sizes.  I found that the large fit her perfectly--still a little space around the neck and the chest had straps that could be adjusted to fit.  My frenchie has a pretty big head and is quite bully but it fit her perfectly!",5
"Purchased this for my 11 week old teddy bear puppy and she absolutely loves it! This is her favorite toy and she carries it everywhere. It is durable but soft and flexible. I think she also likes to chew on it, not sure if it might help with teething. Very happy I purchased this... I feel like I can toss every other toy she has since this is now the only one she will play with!",5
"Really nice...but my cat would not lie in it . He is kinda a jerk sometimes:-) I would like a human sized one for myself! I was able to unload it on craigslist for what I paid for it:-) Stupid cat. He should have loved it.

Note: It is NOT hot. It is a really comfortable ""warm"" and you can remove the heating pad to wash it.",4
"I must not have paid any attention to the overall size of this snake because when it arrived (it was the only item in my order) the box was much bigger than anticipated. That said, I am certainly not disappointed! And neither are my puppy or husband. Those two have turned playing with this toy into a nighttime ritual. My puppy, a 6 month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi, is capable (albeit he still trips up once in awhile!) of carrying/dragging this nearly 3 foot snake around while following my husband trying to get him to play. It is hysterical! It's even long enough that we all get in on the action - my husband and I each squeaking two squeakers and Skip covering the other two. It is a wonderful toy. It gets used as a tug toy more often than not and I must say it has stood up to the abuse brilliantly! Not a single missing eye, tear or rip anywhere. I will be buying more Kyjen toys in the future!",5
"This stuff works, just not good enough on its own.
I ended up using it alongside other flea control methods, such as monthly spot on treatments and flea collars.  I also use it as a way to keep fleas out of beds, rugs, and other areas they could hide.

I tried this product on 4 cats and 1 small dog.  My 2 ""strictly indoor"" cats stopped scratching, but I would still find live fleas on them.  I dusted the 2 outdoor cats, which helped cut back their scratching.  My dog.. he is the worst out of all of them.  The powder did not seem to have any effect on him.  His scratching is still quite frequent.

In the end, I bought spot on treatment for all of my pets.  I powder my indoor cats when I  notice scratching, and outdoor cats once a week.  My dog and 2 indoor cats have flea collars now.  My dog doesnt seem to have more than 1 flea on him at a time when I  comb him, but he still scratches.  I'm using hydrocortisone spray on him in hopes of finding some kind of relief for him.",3
"Great halter for an American Eskimo dog.  These dogs have lots of fur and this works well with my dogs mane.  Easy step in and hooks together above the shoulders.  Would highly recommend.  I can control my dog and he doesn't feel restricted.  He normally doesn't wear anything but when I need to take him to the vet this is great, everything else he has always escaped from and made the vet tech run after him.",5
Great looking shrimp will buy again,5
"Our dogs love these, they are 20-25 lbs and eat one or two of these per day. They seem to keep the teeth relatively clean.",5
"Unfortunately, my dog just didn't take to this toy. But it came just as described and seems like it would be fun for a dog who would get into it. The only complain I have is that the groove in the plug can be damaged very easily, making it hard to take out the plug in the future. I used just a butter knife to twist it out, and already the groove is getting damaged.",4
This is my dog's favorite flavor of Natural Balance food.  He recognizes the name when I say what is for dinner.,5
EVERYONE OF THEM DIED WITH IN 2 DAYS!!!,1
The product is perfect! The idea magnificent! I got it to keep the dog from eating the cats food. My very smart terrier mix broke into it the first day we left it down. Doesn't matter the cat hates it. Lol animal rule our house.,5
Really is a great accurate test kit.  API and others work fine for FOWLR and softie tanks but when you need to keep your nitrates below 5 ppm for some anemones and retain color in your SPS this test kit is the way to go.,5
Came inside dog gate box..  Works very good,4
My doggie absolutely loves these!,5
Great for our small maltese while he is under supervision.,5
This smells great and helps to keep the kitty's bathroom clean and fresh! I use this every time I clean their boxes! 5 stars!,5
"Great design, got the water bowl to match. They are a wonderful little set to have - very stylish and easy to clean.",5
My dogs LOVE these - and my older dog is much more lively now that she's been getting these for a few months.  Her hips were starting to bother her.,5
Love this container.,5
I got these but was scared to use them .My neighbor came over and used them to clip my dogs nails. She works a a vets office and loved them.,5
"Pretty large compared to what I had thought. Has some danger concerns, mine began smoking after I took it out of the fish tank for about 1 minute while I put in a new plant. It was super hot and it would have caught fire had I not placed it back in the water, luckily my fish wasn't in it. When I put it in the tank, the glass shattered. Not a good experience! Now I have a different kind of heater that it super safe and very easy to install, it is also a lot smaller. here is the link http://www.amazon.com/Marina-C10-Compact-Heater-10-Watt/dp/B003TLWWOO/ref=sr_1_19?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1423100949&sr=1-19",1
The dogs like these. I need to use them for at least a month to determine if teeth will be cleaner.,4
"Ok, I'm a fan. I first started using this food for my cat and my new puppy. They love it, eat it all up, and doing super well on it! I had plans to switch my puppy over to Blue Buffalo when she was older so all three of my dogs would eat the same food. Until my picky dog (Who admittedly doesn't really like blue buffalo) ate some of the puppies food and LOVED it. So I took a chance and got the adult version, he finally eats right!! It has been a CHORE getting this dog to eat (He's a skinny breed anyway) I am so thrilled he likes this food so much, so now all my dogs and my cat all eat this brand. Very happy!!",5
Great Deal.  The convenience and the price makes it worth buying it again.  Great Service and a hard to beat price.,5
Fresh and clean. Ordering more!,5
I HAVE AN OLD DOG WITH BAD TEETH. SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T FEEL HIS BEST SO I GIVE HIM THIS WITH GOAT MILK. HE LOVES IT. AND IT MAKES FEEL GOOD.,5
Our 2 Shiba Inu's love this snack and it's a great crispy chew on item as well....,5
"Much better than I expected.  Quality is good enough for the price.  My Frenchie is 30 lbs, neck is about 15.5 inches, and girth is about 21 inches.  I ordered XXL.",5
I know the cats sleep on top of it vs in it as it always folded down flat. Even when I prop it open it is down within a few minutes. Very disappointed,2
"I got this and used it today to clean my tank and also do a water change.  Works like a charm -- simple and easy to use!  The only thing I thought was interesting was that the instruction sheet says ""Packaging comes with a zip lock bag for convenient storage after use.""  That would have been nice but mine came with no such zip lock bag?  Did anyone else notice this too?  Otherwise a very good value and very good gravel cleaner if you need one.  I'm using mine with a 29 gallon freshwater setup.",4
"I have never been a fan of freeze dried foods, or hikari foods in general (a lot of the pellets and flakes are chock full of cheap fillers that fish would never eat in the wild), but takes freeze dried to a whole new level. There are many different ways to feed Bio-Pure cubes to your fish, but my personal favorite is to just take a cube and use my finger to smoosh it against the glass of the aquarium. Think of taking a piece of chewed up gum and sticking it to a wall, same concept here. The cube will stay stuck to the glass and slowly expand while your livestock picks at it. If you have shrimp, they will go crazy ripping it apart and little whole tubifex worms will float around the aquarium and those will be gobbled up by any top dwelling fish you may have. The worms do not disintegrate into mush or powder, but stay as whole worms even after pressing it firmly against the glass and being mercilessly picked at by my shrimp. Tubifex specifically are an excellent food for nano fish, fish with smaller mouths, and micropredators. I was having trouble feeding my scarlet badis until I found this product, and they go absolutely nuts for it. Every day I stick a cube to the same place and both of my male scarlet badis will quickly swim to the feeding spot and just tear away at it like vicious little monsters. Very entertaining to watch. On multiple occasions, I have even watched my otocinclus cats grazing on the cubes, which I never would have expected. If like me you keep a lot of smaller livestock and have trouble finding frozen foods for smaller mouths and don't have any access to smaller live foods, this is an excellent alternative. I highly recommend the Bio-Pure line of freeze dried cubes.",5
My son's dogs loved them!,5
it took my 25lb beagle mere minutes to go through these. :(,1
I live in the middle of nowhere and my dogs and I run every morning and they love to run off leash in the evenings. I love that I can see them around the yard and drivers can see us from a distance.,5
"I fill this ball with kibble and my dogs nose it all around the house. They can empty it pretty quickly, but they love it.",5
Im very pleased with this purchase. The moss balls were packaged well and arrived healthy. Shipping was prompt. They are doing great in the tank and the cherry shrimp love them! Thanks Aquatic Arts!,5
Well made for the price in a beautiful shade of blue.,5
"Perfect crate for my 10 lb mini dachshund, also bought another for my chihuahua. They are very cute, easy to close and helps crate train your pup.",5
My hamsters have fallen in love with this house. It is bigger than expected which is good.,5
"It's not that I love this item - my dog loves this item, and he's picky.  I just gave him one, and he buried it (frown) for future eating.  I purchase treats that are good for his teeth, and I believe this is one of them.  Highly recommend if you have a pooch who's picky.",5
"I love our litter genie, it saves so much time and keeps the house smelling fresh, these refills are so easy to pop right in and out of the system, they seem a little pricey but they last for a while.",5
Flimsy and not worth the money.  Buy the Karen Pryor Clicker.  The Karen Pryor was on back order so I ordered this and it was a waste of money and time juggling a clicker and target stick.,2
"Great brush and exactly what I needed for my short hair persian. I've used the furminator before and this works just as well for the price. the clean up is also pretty great, doesn't get any better than this!",5
I didn't realize this was such a large amount of fish food! I will not have to buy any for a looooong time. Fish love it though.,5
puppy loves it!,5
"This collar is fantastic. We have a very bold and bossy  labrador.  We e place this collar on him, his whole demeanor changes for the better.",5
My bearded dragon is in heaven with this heater. It's big enough for her to lay all the way across it and off to the side when she wants just a little bit of heat. It's a GREAT buy and I would highly recommend this for any reptile! :),5
"I got the 100 gallon one and it works great. I'm running 5 tanks off of it. Great product
10/2017. Lasted only a year just fyi",5
My cats love beating the crud out of these toys.,5
cheaply made. Lid dosnt clamp the way its suppose to. Go to the $1 store and get something cheaper that is better,3
"I don't know how anyone can use anything but this product to clean up after their pets.
The ""mitten"" allows your hand to actually pick up pet waste efficiently and with little mess. I use them for my backyard along with a Diaper Genie to dispose of waste from three dogs and it is the best thing ever!

Mutt Mitt rocks.",5
Dog loves them.  Nice small size for training or small dog.  Like grain free - not too many treats are.,5
Way too hard for puppy teeth. It could easily fracture a puppy's fragile baby teeth. This was a total waste and the puppy had no interest in it whatsoever.,1
"This crate was as described by other reviewers. I am very pleased with this product, as my foxhound has not yet escaped. We purchased a standard wire crate (that had very good reviews) and ended up spending more in home repairs from the times he escaped his crate and chewed doors, windows, closets and even a chandelier...I know... We knew we had to do something to protect both the dog and our home from these panic attacks. We reviewed many online sites and military crates that are all aluminum. They were more expensive, but we also learned that the dogs can injure their noses trying to get out of these aluminun crates. We decided that though this was expensive, we had to believe that we may ultimately save money and our sanity by keeping him contained. So far, three times in the crate for approx. 2-3 hours each time and both the dog and the crate have been in one piece when we return. The large crate is very large, my 56 LB dog likely could have used the medium crate, but since it is working, I wouldn't change a thing!",5
dogs love em,4
Good items to use.,5
My dog loves it. Durable fun,5
The grass was pretty old. Beige-gray color. Not nearly as green as shown. Bunny seems to like it enough though.,3
Good reviews on Petsumer site. One dog likes and the other dog not so much . The actual size (kibble) is smaller than most dog foods. My dogs are 70 and a skinny 99 lbs.  It is a good and healthy dog food .,5
"I travel with my two cats. This is a perfect size for them to have their sand box, bed and eating area. It was incredibly easy to set up and folds away quickly for storing. I am so pleased that I purchased this product.  CONNIE",5
"This was a great purchase I love the way it is adjustable for my pet as he grow, this was a great buy thumbs up!

Thank you,",5
My cat loves it!!!:))) Great quality!,5
Vanilla is not good for dogs !!!,1
Great quality & letter stamping is clear & very readable.,5
My french bulldog likes the holistic health dry foods and they treat his stomach and fur well. His typical flatulence is reduced with these foods and he enjoys all the kinds which we switch and transition to now and again.,5
Entertaining for a few minutes until my 20 pound Cairn Terrier chews the ball enough to pop the plastic squeaking device out of the ball.  A bit too costly for such an untimely death and it happened to them all.,3
"I'm a big fan of Hikari in general.  I have used the Micro pellets for a wide variety of freshwater fish including juvenile cichilds, bettas, and schooling fish (barbs, danios, tetras, etc.)  Everyone readily takes to this food.  It creates minimal waste compared to flakes, is easier to handle, and one bag goes a long way.  A general tip for pelleted fish food: store it in your freezer and keep a week or two worth in a small pill container.  The food will stay much fresher that way, with minimal breakdown of its nutritional value.",5
I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and I keep his hair long. The furminator is amazing. You will not believe how much hair it gets without pulling and hurting your dog. The only negative I can think of is why the heck did I wait so long to get one...,5
"These really don't move much water.
My cheaper Aqueons move way more water.

The magnet bases are cool.
But the 400 doesn't adjust well at all on it's magnetic base.
I'm actually using it without the magnetic base attached.",3
I live on the coast of Georgia and fleas and ticks are a real problem.  These collars help a lot !!,4
"Just as described; is not too thick/fluffy but is a crate bed.
I have a Wheaten Terrier that is mostly outside during the day, and she gets filthy and brings the dirt to the crate at night; I've washed and dried this bed a couple of times so far, and it looks new.
It seems very well made, and nothing has unraveled or come apart in the wash yet.  I definitely feel I got my money's worth with this product, and when it's time to replace it, will buy again.",5
My dog likes this alot so far.,5
"My mastiff has been eating this food since he was born.  No need for puppy kibble or special puppy food, he was eating this since I got him from my breeder at around 8 weeks.

I like that it's high quality at a reasonable price for the 44 pound bag as my dog goes through a lot of food.

I've been supplementing his diet recently with Taste of the Wild dog food, as it is grain free and high in meat and protein.  I do believe that variety is a key to a successful diet and will supplement his diet further with raw meat, eggs and vegetables.",5
"My dogs love these, we have three. Excellent quality, fleece lining is nice and warm, and the girls look adorable in them. We have a lab, XXL, a mixed breed -papillon/ Aussie, L, and a jack Russell mix, M. Will buy more of these for sure!!",5
thank you!,5
Best idea ever! Saved my new couch from the love my cats would bestow upon it.,5
"Cheap crap - Don't buy it! Yes some of you might have got lucky, and haven't got a faulty one, but they are crappy! Mine was broken from the factory, and was making sparks, pretty scarry! (And yes i checked the power was not a mismatch) Get an aPump, same size - works awesome!",1
I have a 20 pound Schnauzer and I thought the 20X28 bed was too small for him.  I returned it.,2
"My cats didn't like these, and after eating them they weren't much calmer, I'm afraid. I gave them these for a long car ride...they were still completely miserable and wired.",2
"Dingo the dog loved it, but he is gone now and I miss him.  Good bed at a good price.",5
"Will work for our older dog but it's bulky to carry around in the car (though I'm not sure how you could make it less bulky and still strong enough to work.)  We will likely make due until we absolutely have to use it. We have an older Jeep, and it definitely does not work with the doors. The dogs have to come in through the tailgate.",4
"I love it, it smell so good, every time I give my yorkie a bath everyone notice because of the smell",5
Doggo doesn't really get these- I think they're too hard and she loses interest after a short period of time. They smell good though.,3
"I keep buying this product because cats absolutely love it.  I give them to friends.  If you have a multi cat household, they will fight over it. That's why I get a multi pack.  Eventually they will tear it up, although I've found it is much more sturdy than other cat toys.  My single elderly cat still has his first one.  There's something about the shape of this toy that's appealing.  However, I've found that the cigar, banana, and fish offered by this same company are very well loved too.",5
"Our cats really like this toy.  We have to hide it when we are not playing with them.

They never seem to tire of it.  Made in America!",4
"I'm posting because I read SO many comments/questions about fit disparities when I was shopping around, so hopefully this helps someone.  We have a 9 year old French Bulldog and she is on the tiny size; she's 19 lbs with a smaller head.  We bought this harness in the large size and it's pretty perfect.  I will say that we have the chest strap extended pretty much to the max, so if your fur baby is rotund you may want to go up a size and just use it on the smallest strap setting.  It's strong, though, and really cute.. and she seems to be comfortable in it.  Very easy to get on and off, as opposed to other harnesses that we've tried that are kind of tedious.",5
Cat loves this. Only toy he'll play with on a daily basis. Had 5 paper pieces on one end and one on the other end. Almost 2 months of daily playing now and it's still going strong. I taped one end around my bottom bed post sticking straight up and the cat plays with it like crazy.,5
So far my red heeler pit mix is loving his new bed! Have had it for about a month and it's holding up well.,4
I have a kitten who loves to dig and usually makes a swinging mess when he's in the litter box.  This has helped a lot keeping the litter in the box and the large size makes it a good fit for a 2 kitten household.,5
"I bought this bed for my 14 year old Springer Spaniel. He was having a problem getting up and down from his softer bedding with weakness in this backend this looked like a good option. For those of us who have tried to switch dog beds you know how particular they are about thier beds. The moment of truth I replaced the old bed and replaced it with the Serta True Response Orthopedic bed he went up and sniffed it jumped up on it, gave a couple of turns and then collapsed and went to sleep. Success! He loves the bed and it really seems to be helping his hind end weakness he gets up easier and less stiff! A great bed for the senior dog nice and long so they can sprawl out.",5
love it.,5
Smells so strawberry! My dog hates the smell of this stuff but I love it and everyone gives her compliments about how delicious she smells.,5
"The Sheba Perfect Portions Variety Pack is great if you have a picky eater. If your cat likes to pick and just eat a bite at a time, then these are the perfect size. It contains 24 twin packs for a total of 48 servings. Each twin pack could be served at once but the pack can be torn apart and served one at a time. I like that the box contains 3 different flavors because my cats get tired of one flavor and like to switch around.",5
"Works fine, does the trick.",5
"This is a review of Wellness CORE Puppy food based on a bit more than two weeks of use. My Havanese puppy came to me from the breeder on Life's Abundance, a premium food which also met my standards (not made in China, etc). I wasn't initially inclined to change it. However, his digestion was somewhat inconsistent, and he was gassy. Starting at 14 weeks or so of age I decided to try him on Wellness Core puppy based on the positive reviews and the fact that I had tried some Wellness treats with him, which he likes and seemed to digest well.

So far, his digestion is much better and has improved as I have moved him off of Life's Abundance (I was gradually mixing in the Wellness Core at first). The kibbles are a bit bigger (I would say roughly 5 mm/ 1/4"" in diameter each). than the previous food but still very much accessible to a puppy of his size (currently about 6 lbs). The 4 pound bag is a reasonable price and a good size; I expect it to last about a month for him, if not a bit more (he eats about 3/4 - 1 cup a day). Finally, his coat has stayed as healthy and shiny as it was on his previous food!",5
This product was great until it stopped working- I dropped it on the floor and it was broke!,3
Would be a 5 star if the top wasn't do hard to turn. Other than that it works great. Have 2 tanka using these.,4
My parrots not to happy with this Nutri-Berries treat.,3
"These covers fit the dog food cans perfectly.  I was hesitant to buy these at first since I am fine with using foil to cover my dog's canned food in the fridge but these are so much better.  They are reusable and so much better than foil, highly recommended.",5
Great value for these bags. I am a return customer and will continue to be one.,5
"I was recommended this by a friend (who is also in the animal rescue business and a prior animal trainer). My dog had started exhibiting some severe anxiety to storms at night. She was inconsolable and keeping everyone up at night. I went ahead and ordered it based on the reviews and just hoped for a little relief for her. I was impressed. While it didn't take away her anxiety, it certainly made it more manageable. She was able to relax a bit more and at least get a little bit of relief. I did not expect this to work as well as it did, which definitely plays into my opinion of it. Had I expected a miracle, I would have been disappointed. However, for taking the edge off, it does the trick. I have used this multiple times already and have gotten a consistent reaction. I would recommend this product, so long as you keep your expectations realistic. It's a nice quick little remedy when you need it.",5
good nutrition without lots of filler. Dogs love it.,5
my puppy loves it!,5
cats like them but like the natural better,3
This lasts a long time and I think it's been helping my bird. I like the fact that you can mix it into their water because it increases the chances that they'll actually ingest it as opposed to sprinkling it in your bird's food. He also likes to nibble it off a spoon so I know it doesn't taste bad!,5
This is too small for a very small dog. lol,2
This collar is still in use on our dog 7 months in.  I am happy with the performance and adjust-ability.  I would purchase again.,4
Excellent product! Goes right through tangles without upsetting kitty.,5
"The product looks good, but my cats are not too fund of it. I think it may be a matter of getting them used  to it if they can have only lamb, if allergies dictate.",3
This product really works. Stains on my 7 year old cavalier King Charles Spaniel's mouth are fading . The tears on my B & T cavalier has slowed down and the smell has disappeared. Just re-ordered,5
"My cat has needed on a special diet for years.  In the beginning, I bought the expensive brands, yet he still had frequent UTIs.  Switched to this food and he hasn't needed additional vet care beyond the usual check ups.",5
Absolutely Gracie's favorite treat. They are healthy yet delicious. Great as a reward for my still-learning Maltese who needs a little motivation. She turns her head at some many different treats so happy to find one she loves!,5
This has saved my car.,3
"This cleared our pond right up.  We love this product.  Our pond was a murky mess and nothing worked to clear it.  I put a dose in and two days later a second dose and the water cleared right up without hurting any of our fish, tadpoles or frogs.",5
Great for kittens!,5
Kinda flimsy. My keets had it cracked in one day by just bouncing on it.,3
"I bought these so I could have an emergency food and water bowl to keep in my car. They are well made and nicer than I thought they'd be. Also, you can't beat the price. Also, I've packed one (of the 4) in a small pack that I carry when walking my dog on the trails near my house. It takes up very little room, is light weight and very easy to clean when returning home. This is a good product - it will get lots of use.",5
"Does not last, less than 3 days!",1
Excellent,5
good,5
Not as efficient as I expected.,3
"The Midwest Quiet Time Fashion Bed works perfectly with the Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate. It is plush yet can still be washed in the washing machine. The filling does not shift during washing and for the price, I am very impressed. I plan to purchase a 2nd one just so I have one to use while the other is being washed.",5
great price - perfect for small crate,5
Dog loves these.  I stuff them into her Kong toy for more lasting treat.,5
"Works great. Great price, too. Thank you.",5
"I never knew these existed until I was on Amazon.  They actually work very well, it keeps my tank clean and helps circulate the water.  It also breaks up the surface tension allowing oxygen into your water.  This is a lot more quite than a pump and air stone, and just as effective.",5
This is a nice treat container and looks really good. The only issue I have with it is that the top is very tight and requires to hands to open. It not a big deal but if you are holding your dogs leash with one hand it can be a bit of a pain to get a treat.,4
Very nice and well built. I only gave it five stars for size. The bottom bed is way to small for a big cat. The top is a good size. I have very big boys (Maine Coons) but it is usable for sitting to look out the window.,4
this was the best the thing for my busy lifestyle,4
My dog did not like it. It made her really sick. The turkey caused her to have really bad stomach problems.,2
cute,5
arrived pretty crunched - but the dog doesn't seem to mind.,3
"This s the only products I trust in my fish tank. I've been using it for years, Amazon def has it cheaper them Petco or PetSmart. Most buy for your freshwater plants helps keep them flourishing.",5
My cat does not sit on it much but it is a nice addition to the post!,4
This toy is definitely tough. My dog (terrier mix) has destroyed stuffed toys in a matter of minutes. But this one is over 2 months old and doing great and he plays with it for an hour or so every day. The fins are gone as he did pull at them and I ended up cutting them off but there are no other holes in it. I would definitely buy it again.,5
I returned this!!  So why the 5 star?  Because it works as described.  I thought it was an auto-refiller but it is not.  It aerates the water which is good for the pets.  It worked like it should but it was not what I wanted.,5
"I use these in place of a regular litter box. Does that make the most financial sense? No, but I will never have to scrub a little box and that is 100% worth it for me. I have one cat and it lasts about two weeks before I throw it away and replace.",5
"I've been using this for YEARS.  It's the only thing that got rid of chronic ear infections that two of our Goldens had.  Best of all, no antibiotics.  The additional hydrocortisone helps with pain.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has a dog with ear infections....whether occasional or chronic.  Make sure to use as directed!  Go to the manufacturer's website for more in depth information on all Zymox products. (Pet King Brands)  They have many things that are excellent and you can purchase all here on Amazon.",5
I just love how lightweight this bowl is. So easy to carry around when we are hiking with the dogs. Its also very durable and well-made and has held up well to the wear and tear on our long walks. We have gone through a few different dog bowls and they always end up cracking or tearing and we have to throw them away. But this one has been great. And the design is perfect because it is nice and sturdy. Our dogs really go to town on this thing when we stop for our little breaks and this bowl never spills because of its nice sturdy base. (Love that its BPA free too) Just LOVE this bowl!,5
"After considerable research to find the best value in a reliable litter box solution, I came upon several review sources which began to reveal a common trend. Automated litter boxes can run upwards of $500, including one which hooks up to a water supply and works like a flush toilet to recycle the letter ""media"". The Scoop Free Ultra was my selection and was worth every bit of time and money I invested to find a reliable solution. See my review on Just the Crystals and mention of the Forever Litter Tray as a combo that provides a cost and design benefit over the Scoop Free disposable cartridges.",5
"Small dogs often have more dental issues than medium to large dogs and our newly rescued, 12-pound, elderly poodle mix was in need of extractions a week after we adopted him. He now needs preventative care to keep him from losing additional teeth. ""Greenies"" dental dog treats was recommended by our veterinarian as one of several ways to prevent plaque and tarter build-up. I purchased the teenie size (not sure why it is described as a ""weight management"" option since this is the recommended size for 5-15 pound dogs). He simply loves these treats, even with his limited number of teeth, and they don't crumble like some of the other dental treats do! This daily treat keeps him happy during our dinnertime.",5
This dish doesn't work well with large breed with a big nose.  She got frustrated and walked away leaving food.  Next time frustrating bowl met a large paw and flipped the food out.  If the channels were a little wider it would have worked.,1
"ran small, great fit, texture, and function.",4
These are absolutely wonderful. My fur baby was having a little trouble with the whole concept of wee wee pad training and these have worked wonders.,5
"Cats don't mind this carrier, however one of them is able to break out if the zippers aren't clipped together or they aren't at the bottom.",5
Dogs love them!,5
I really like the feature of being able to separate the layers and pour the litter back in the box.,5
Seems to work good on our 13 year old huskie,5
The dog food had considerable more protien content so it went well withthe high-energy of my working dogs. Speedy delivery.,5
I bought this to put Purigen in it. It works perfectly and it is much cheaper than the official Seachem bags. It does come with zip ties to tie off the product.,5
Great item!,5
"Pencil thin, I could snap them in half ... the dog ate one in 3 mins. Went back to a different supplier. I'd lower price if I was selling ""Bully Pencils.""",1
well made,5
My dog loves it.  It keeps him so warm and snuggles his body well.  Recommend this product to others.  Great,5
"Easy to use, Great Place for Beneficial Bacteria, Servicing is Fast & Simple. Favorite filter brand.",5
Love this! I use the high calorie content to fatten up my underweight foster dogs,5
My dog seems to have a little more pep in her step! We will continue this product!,5
My Bichon puppies can go through one in 10 minutes.  Bichons are a small breed with small mouths.,2
"Healthy food for your pet, My dogs checkups are better and my vet says that it is better for their digestive tracts.",5
Works good. Helps you to use less shampoo.,5
Turtle nibbles on it sometimes. Works as it should.,5
"My cats think these are okay, but my chihuahua loves them. Really neat and would buy again.",5
My babies don't like to be comed or brushed and this is a good way to grab that loose hair.,4
Perfect fit for whisper replacements however be aware that they provide only 1 new frame! So you have to get your hands a bit dirty in replacement!,4
Does exactly what it needs too. Inside is easy to clean out and is also waterproof in case you want to use it as portable water bowl.,5
"Well, I don't like it per say, but the cats seem to really enjoy it.  >^-^<

I have a colony of semi-feral cats that have all been TNR (trapped, neutered, and released) in my backyard.  They are assorted ages and sizes, I feel comfortable giving this to them, because I think it is probably meeting all of their needs.",4
"I bought these for 2 dogs. They took them but weren't crazy about them. They dry out fast even with the bag sealed. We finished the bag but I didn't see any improvement in them. I think it was too soon.
The price on Amazon was good.
I ended up buying another brand when we finished these.",2
Great idea and looks great but not easy to clean because top doesn't go on and off very easily. Needs a bigger rim for the top to sit on and fit to bottom.,3
"I got the medium to go with my Chick-It.  My Brittany was losing tennis balls in the ocean foam.  The duck is high quality product, is unstable bouncing around creating more fun.  I liked that it didn't smell like the chuck-it balls I order.  It floats upright for more visibility in the water.  It flys with some interesting results.  It is hard to pick-up with the chuck-it, and at times doesn't seat correctly.  Good toy, not perfect.",3
"This stuff is perfect for my salamanders. I absolutely over ordered. The only ""complaint"" I have is it's just too much soil.  The smell from the tank has pretty much gone away as well. It's just amazing. I'll order again for sure.",5
works great,5
didn't last long,3
This light works! Almost too well... let's just say my boy dog was in a lot of trouble after this light made his secret and otherwise invisible marks shine like beacons on my furniture!,5
This toy has been a favorite of every cat I have purchased one for. It's my go-to present for cat owners (especially those with lazy cats).,5
gave my dog a bad rash,2
"Excellent quality product.
we use it a lot, easy to use.
Recommend it highly.",5
"Works great! I have read these numerous reviews about the velcro strips not working but did work fine for me. I issue, however, is the smell. It has a pretty strong nylon smell. I will try to wash it and then use it because otherwise this leaves a smell in the whole car.",4
"Could have saved $8 by buying a spray bottle from the dollar store along with a bottle of rubbing alcohol.  That's what this smells like.  Rubbing alcohol, which a friend told me is what she uses to treat flea problems.  Save your money, get a flea comb, rubbing alcohol and a spray bottle.",3
"4 budgies, and they climb all over it. Sometimes all 4 are lined up on the perch proper - maybe one climbing around it, trying to get on! LOL",5
My puppy loves them a lot.,5
"We used to buy this product at Costco, but they stopped carrying it, so I immediately searched for it on Amazon. Naturally Amazon carries it like everything else you're looking for, plus cheaper, no shipping charge and no sales tax!  Our two dogs love this stuff, and go right for their food like it's filet mignon right after we pump some on to it.  And the best part, it's so good for them too!",5
If your dog is a chewer I do not recommend this toy. It's last less than two minutes.,2
"NICE BIG BISCUITS FOR MY CANARIES , THEY LOVE THEM AND FEED THEM TO MY OR THERE BABY HATCHLINGS , PEFECT SIZE FOR ALL BIRDS , I SOFTEN IT WITH WARM WATER AND THEY LOVE IT ALONG WITH KALE ,",5
"Nature's Variety Instinct Grain-Free Chicken Meal Dry Cat Food is awesome. NV Instinct is the perfect kibble .. Our cats are crazy about it .. I think some wet food in the diet is very important . Since the only canned our 4 picky Persian cats will eat is Friskies seafood variety pack I wanted to find very good kibble to make up the difference . NV Instinct is it .. Our cats are looking great and they love every bite. It is all natural with, high protein, grain free and gluten-free. I would definitely recommend it for unique breeds like Persian and Himalayan cats.",5
"Does what it should and does not affect the airflow of my Hydrofarm 3watt at all! For anyone confused the arrow on the side of the product is the direction your air should be going, so put the air tube connected to your air pump on the black side.",5
This is a free standing dog cage that you put a frame around.  The frame can be removed and the cage used on its own. The frame is  sort of flimsy and falls apart if the dog wiggles too much.  It barely makes having a  dog cage in my living room more attractive.  The wooden top is not very strong so don't put anything too heavy on it. I purchased the large size for my pit bull and after trying to get out of the cage a few times she bent it enough to escape.,2
dog loves them but the squeaker doesn't last,4
Worm X plus wormer is easy to use and works great. My dogs like it. Is a good price also.,5
"I rescued a 100 plus pound great dane. She was a good on the leash about 80% of the time but when she wanted to investigate something off trail I got yanked hard.  Like others say, your dog will hate this initially.  Mine sure did.  She would try to rub it off her face on the gound for the first couple days but quickly got over it. Please make sure you size it correctly.  The face strap should have enough play to reach the nose so its not too tight on your dogs head/face.  I love walking my dog with this.  No more yanking on the leash.  I switched over to a super light weight leash.  I think I could walk her with a cat leash--no joke.",5
"Love it , our vet really liked it ! I now ordered the pink gingham , can't wait for it to arrive !",5
As described and on time delivery.,5
"Betta loves them, he's very healthy!",5
"I love these bags!! They were delivered in a couple of days. I ordered the bags to use for scooping my cat's litter box. They are plenty big enough, strong enough and just plain pur-fect ! I would certainly buy the bags again and 100% would recommend them you will not be disappointed..",5
My puppy did not care for it. Gave it away.,3
actually only toy. she is allowed to play with only few minutes. used to sleep in her cage with it. she destroys all toys and her sister dog eats the stuffing. this is her third or fourth one because I don't always get them in time.,5
This brush is great! Easily cleans the fur off. makes my cats fur much softer and helps with shedding.,5

"Our dog faithfully potties on these things and it took us YEARS to potty train him as a puppy. Very happy with product. Just needs a good regular soak to keep it from smelling like pee, but cleaning is also very easy.",5
Didn't last...,2
My puppy loves this stuff and won't eat any other dry food .. looks like I'll be going broke now ha,5
Puppy loves this!!!,5
These are the best Clippers that worked for my cocker spaniel..... I didn't use the combs just shaved him close... I am not a professional.... Everyone likes differnent ones.,5
"Perfect fit for 30x21x24 crate. Nice design, good quality. Recommended.",5
"Great product, good price easy to dispense with the pump. dog likes it too.
first bottle leaked and the company sent me another. Can't ask for better customer service than that!",5
"These are awesome, don't splinter, last forever. I currently have 4 in various locations. I have a super picky dog when it comes to well, everything, and she loves these.",5
good product keeps my dog entertained.,5
Works as expected,4
"It's just a big tunnel. Wish I had known the length, my hamster is way too small for it. Didn't use it once.",1
"I didn't know about this product until I had 5 little kittens to take care of.  I don't know what happened to their mommy, but one day, we found these cute little guys under our deck.  So, cute and so tiny!  Their little eyes were crusted over and they were so scared. Their little cries were heartbreaking.

They were very difficult to catch (took HOURS to get them all!) and I was so relieved to finally have them safely caught.  But once we got them, THAT'S when the work really began.  I had no idea what I was supposed to feed them!  They certainly couldn't eat regular cat food.  I really had no clue what to do.

I called my wonderful local animal shelter and they gave me some pointers - how to clean their little eyes, how to keep them warm and what and how to feed them.  They recommended KMR Power because it's easy to mix and they've been happily using it for years.

The little kittens did very well on this power.  They gobbled it up and they grew large enough (after a few weeks) to be able to be taken to the shelter and adopted out.

It was a lot of work taking care of these little guys but the experience was really magical.  I'm thankful we have these types of foods available to help us feed these little guys.

The animal shelter is always looking for more KMR powder, so I purchase it here on Amazon and have it shipped to them every so often.",5
"I wrote on 5 star comment on this harness which I now have to change to a three star.

The two o-rings on the top back of the harness, for the leash to be attached to, click together whenever the dog shakes herself or scratches. It sounds like CANASTAS!!!  Its VERY ANNOYING....Due to that reason alone, we are replacing the harness with another brand.

The harness WAS good, was well padded with suede on the inside, which I liked, but the NOISINESS of it is something we can't adjust to.

(Note: most small breed dogs are very prone to developing a collapsed trachea if they wear a regular collar.....they pull against the collar, and it speeds up the trachea collapse, which, if your dog coughs a lot, or vomits small amounts at some times, is probably what is wrong....check with your vet, but best thing is to prevent the problem by NEVER putting a collar on the dog......just leave the harness on, no reason to remove it and replace it all the time, leave it on as you would a collar!)",3
To big for my puppy but super cute! Had to return.,4
This keeps my 19# dog from choking when she pulls on the leash.  At first she was hesitant to get it put on so I'd give her a small treat.  She's a MinPin/Daschund cross and it fits her perfectly.  It seems to be well made.  The outer fabric is mesh.,5
"who'd been through a lot--and had lost most of her hair. Her skin was blackened, in big patches. She was one woebegone specimen....
A neighbor who's involved in the Pyr rescue told me that the breed can't handle corn, a major ingredient in most canine feeds: I switched her to Hill's Ideal Balance Chicken/Rice--and within 3 months, her whole coat had come back in. People couldn't believe the transformation. (I've got pix....)

Too, her original owner had described her as a ""picky eater,"" but she loves the stuff. (I DO mix in something meaty, for extra flavor.)

Although it's more expensive than what I'd been feeding, I switched my four Jacks to it, as well: No more frantic, constant itching and hot spots!  Hard to believe what this stuff can do.",5
"Piece of junk!!! Don't waste your money, useless!!!",1
"Very cool concept, however for $60 I was very disappointed with the quality.  Very very cheap materials, I would never put this on my dog it isn't soft and would lead the dog to chafe.  Wish the material was better because I want an LED disco dog!",2
"I have a 90 lb dobie and he loves to play.  He loves this ball it is not as big as I thought it looked like 4"" but bounces really great and he can chew on it and nothing happens to it.",5
"I love it. Spider Hound! This XXL costume works well for my Basset Hound.  The legs are little long for a Basset, but that tends to be pretty standard issue with buying clothes for the breed. The material is thin and won't provide warmth.  The outfit closes with Velcro fasteners. Super cut.",5
"The dog's hair is fluffy, and smells great. Will buy again, for sure. Tsk, Norm",5
"My cat Meatball is too big to fit on the tiny window sills in my new apartment, and he couldn't watch cat tv which is his favorite. He loves his new bed!! Now he can watch all the time. It was super easy to install, just place the plastic piece down, mark where the screws go (I was NOT about to rely on Velcro to hold up my 18 pound Meatball) and screw the plastic piece on with a drill, put the bed back on and you're all set! Hes so happy :)",5
This little shirt is excellent quality.  Sizing is hard to judge but after reading other reviews I deteremined to try an XL for my 12 lb. poodle mix.  The shirt is a tad large but will shrink with washing.  I'm happy that I chose the XL.,5
fleas dislike,5
I love this animal carrier for my puppy. I take him wherever I go in this. He actually likes being in it. It has plenty of room for my puppy. Very well made.,5
"My dog loved these Nylabones.  He would chew on them for hours and play with them, as well.  It's good that they came in different flavors, too.",5
Our dog loves them,5
works great.  My doodles stay in back set now...no problems,5
My dog slips out of this and still coughs and chokes.  There are better choices available out there to consider,2
"I have a 7 yr. old female spayed cat who is very territorial and started marking a while back.  She was also very aggressive toward my other cat (her sister - same age). I tried the pheromone spray, and those helped her stay away from particular areas, but she would just go somewhere else.  The Sentry collar is great in that you just put it on the cat and the scent follows them around.  I take it off of her when she goes outside and keep in a ziploc bag to extend the life.  The only other thing I had found that worked was anxiety medication, but pilling a cat is not something I want to do on a regular basis.  The collar makes her a little sleepy, but not a complete zombie like the anxiety meds.  It was either this or keep her outside all the time, so the collar has really been wonderful.  The issue has not been 100% resolved, but is much improved.  She has not had any issues with a rash or scratching, and had never even worn a collar before.",4
My elderly dog is a picky eater and loves this. One of two I feed her and so far - keeping my fingers crossed - she will continue to love it.,5
My dog loves them and its one treat of the day.,4
"This is a great toy and well worth the money.  As long as my U2 can chew on it and play, I am happy, too!!",5
works well (as long as i cut my pup's nails when he's asleep so he doesn't freak out on me),4
"There are many things I like about this bed.  First, the fabric does not attract dog hair at all.  Second, there is the very sturdy velcro closure that makes it easy to take off the cover and also eliminates the need for zippers that can be chewed or otherwise broken.  Third, it is an attractive bed and matches our decor.  Fourth,  I like the fact that water beads up when it gets on the bed.  I don't know if I would call it waterproof but it certainly repels water.  My dogs have accidents sometimes so for me this is a very useful feature.  Finally, I like the fact that a new cover can be ordered if necessary without having to order an entirely new bed.  The bed makes a noise when the dogs step on it but none of my 3 dogs seem to mind that at all.  Unfortunately, my little 10 lb. dog chewed a quarter-sized hole in it after I had it for about 10 days.  The good news is that the material doesn't seem to fray and 3 weeks later he has not ripped it any further.  I contacted the manufacturer and they immediately sent me a free replacement cover.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that my dog was able to chew a small hole in the cover.  I doubt that there is such a thing as a dog bed that is indestructible.  This company never made that claim so there is little for me to complain about.",4
"my cat loves it, as soon as it was open from the packaging, he went in and didn't want to come out. using daily and won't get tire of this. should have gotten sooner.",5
"This product is great for dogs! The carpeted stairs make it so the dog does not slip. My little dog loves the stairs because now she can get in bed and she is not afraid to go up or down the stairs. Quality, durable and stability are excellent. Would reccomend for any dog owner.",5
"This has become our dog's new favorite chew toy.  She loves dental dinosaur but I was trying to find something else as that one was getting pretty sad looking.  I feel like a lot of the chew toys have pretty crappy design - simply a hard piece of plastic in a somewhat interesting shape.  She likes the different textures of this and it's big enough for her to put her mouth and paws on (though, as a 5 month golden retriever, it's still kinda heavy for her).  I like that it has the color on it too, so we can find it in the yard.",5
Good product,5
It is not working for our dog. I sprayed it on his crate and he did not like the smell and would not go in the crate. After he was in the crate he still had the bug eyes and panic panting. It's like we never sprayed anything in the crate. So disappointed.,1
"My cats and my friends' cats adore these small ""fish"" that pack a powerful catnip punch. My cats abuse them heartily and they remain in perfect condition.",5
"I really like it; some people in reviews complained at how there was still some plastic in some areas, which is true, but I fixed that. For the price, I honestly think it looks pretty realistic, for a plastic plant, I mean really!! :)",5
Great product!,5
I've had these running for three days now and only two of the four are releasing bubbles the full length of the stick.,2
"Doggo did not like it at first, but day two it saved my back and the dog no longer pulled.  Walks right by my side now after only a few days.  45 lb dog.",5
"My cat played with this for about 5 minutes and this is actually a big deal for her!  Her biggest source of entertainment is watching me unwrap all the dozens of toys I buy for her then she just wanders off.  After the first 5 minutes the feathers came off.  NOT a big deal, nothing was broken, the string just came untied.  Turns out...NOW she loves it.  She loves chasing the string around from the end of the stick.  Soooo, probably didn't need to invest in this but she is my baby and Santa brought it.  The set comes with an extra set of feathers that easily attach for all those kitties that are actually interested in the feathers.  I will probably just have to invest in more string.  Overall it is a nice toy and seems to be well made, would highly recommend.",4
"My pooch loves PrideBites products.  He has a bunch of products from the company and I've been pleased with every single item.  The toy is cute, durable and squeaks which he loves.  Everyone thinks its hilarious when they come over and see a 6lb puppy playing with a martini.",5
This is exactly what I was needing. Great quality and workmanship.,5
"I rely on Dr. Tim's products and add a capful or two of this whenever my fish experience any kind of stress, like a temperature change or being moved.",5
"I bought a couple of these to cover some parts of her cage that aren't easy on her feet, and she loves to nibble on them, and so far they have lasted for a couple of months and were perfect for what I needed them for.  I even cut one in half to fit her little hallways in the bunny condo, and those have remained intact as well.  A good product for snoozing, chewing, and whatever.",5
"size perfect, fits like it should",5
"I don't know who invented the self-cleaning slicker brush, but nonetheless, I hold them in high esteem.  Because these are so easy to use, pets get brushed on a more regular basis, so their coats are soft and shiny.  I haven't found they eliminate the need for a Furminator (brand intended), especially during shedding season, but the self-cleaning slicker brushes are fantastic for daily use.  One of our cats loves being slicker brushed so much that just hearing the click of the bristle button causes her to come running, plop down and surrender to the brush.

As per this particular slicker brush, I find it to be excellent quality. It's very sturdy and has a padded grip. This product is identical in construction to the Innopaw brand slicker brush--it's just a different color.",5
Exactly what I ordered only surprise was that the name was bigger then the rest of the text lines but that's not a complaint it looks nice,5
Glove too big and clumsy to do a good brushing. My cat hates being brushed and I thought this would help to mimic me petting him. Does little to nothing on his long fur. Glove is hard to keep on,1
"""Jefferson"" is quickly warming up to the tunnel.  He especially likes the ball on the end of the tunnel.",5
Dogs and cats love this treat.  I love that it's good for them.,5
"I wouldn't say this 100% stops the pulling, but it does a much better job than anything else we've tried! Our pup is a seriously puller and doesn't seem to care whether a leash is around her collar or a harness. From day one, we noticed that she was much more hesitant to pull on this leash. She definitely didn't seem to be in pain or too bothered when the leash squeezed, but she just seemed to be avoiding getting the squeeze. I think it's more of an annoying thing for them. She's not exactly loose leash walking now and is definitely still pulling a bit, but not nearly as much or as hard as she was before. I don't come back from walks with my hand in pain anymore!

The leash is really easy to put on and I love the pink color!",4
"Works well enough. It's very light, folds down easily, etc... The only downside, is that it's so light it's very easy for your pup to use it like a hamster wheel. It does come with loops for anchoring.",5
My dog loves this kennel because she doesn't feel confined.  I rated 3 start because it rattles a lot when she moves around.,3
"Didn't work for my dog. The bag says that you can double or triple... use as needed.
My dog weighs 3 lbs. She eats 5 of these (10x what the bag suggests) and is still on edge during grooming.",1
The gerbils love it! Their coats were getting oily.,5
"it looks really pretty, and it arrived really fast. when I opened it there was a VERY strong plastic smell. I soaked it overnight, but it was still smelling strong the next day. when I ordered it, I didn't realize how bristly the foliage was. years ago I had an angelfish that was startled and got his long fins tangled in a round bristly plant that was in the tank. I didn't notice it in time, and it died. since I have angels in the tank I ordered it for, I decided to put it in my glow fish tank instead. it's very pretty, but I wish I would've paid more attention before I ordered it.",4
I don't have it assembled yet but it is exactly what I wanted.,5
"I have purchased many Nylabones before for my Golden Retriever and my Chocolate Lab. This toy looked like a perfect toy for them, but my only concern was the green rubber overlay in the middle of the toy. I was concerned that they would be able to chew it off of the toy since it is softer than the other Nylabone Materials. I bought it anyway, and I am glad that I did. They have been playing with this toy for a long time now and the green rubber overlay is in perfect condition. They have not managed to chew it off. Since this toy worked for my dogs, I would recommend this toy for other medium to large size dogs.",5
"I like this product,but it was kind of squashed,and pressed together. Makes it difficult to use.",4
Good for my dog's sensitive skin.,5
"Guinea pigs  love being in dark warm spaces, ND being held. This is perfect for kids holding guinea pigs.",5
"I bought this for my mother who has nerve issues. She loves that it's wide enough to cover her neck and shoulders. She says it beats fighting with other ice packs to keep them in place. It does take up some room in your freezer, but I guess when you live in constant pain that doesn't matter.",5
We bought this leash 3 weeks ago for our 150 lb. Akita. My 71 year old husband loves the leash so much that I haven't had a chance to use it yet.,5
"My cat is weird and liked to scratch on the mirrored doors of my closet, so I bought her this litter box with walls to try and stop that.  It totally worked!  She scratches this instead and isn't damaging the mirror anymore.  I also like that it came with a scooper that hooks onto the shield thing, it's so convenient and you'll never lose the scooper.",5
I'm not sure what to think - my cat took one (1) tablet on an empty stomach and the next day she had a small bit of leaky tan-colored poo on her bedding. Stopped giving it to her due to this. My cat is an older goddess with no other health issues other than a slightly off liver. (I'd love to give her half a tablet but the instructions clearly state you are not to split them).,3
"Love these. Have to order more this evening. Safe and the dogs go nuts over them. I have bug dogs, so I highly recommend  them for big dogs too. We get the bacon flavor. Rotisserie chicken they seem to like too!",5
My cat loves this! And she's so picky. And it's great because it's good for both cats and kittens so I can feed my 4 year old and my new kitten the same food! Highly recommend!!,5
"I like it, but it's a bit tight on my 16 lb Dachshund mix. That makes it difficult to put on/off. I can't imagine buying a large for such a small dog.",3
"I bought this for my teacup yorkies and it actually works, they love the taste and will even eat them right out of your hand.  My older yorkie (14) has bad breath from being older and I had tried other things that just didn't work long term, this really does work and his breath has improved since using them.  The fact that they like the taste is an added bonus since trying other methods was sometimes a challenge.",5
My puppies loves this toy! Wonderful toy for my babies!,5
Dog loves these toys,5
This works A*M*A*Z*I*N*G!  My cane corso pup went through everything imaginable for training.  From pinch collars to the kind leash.  Nothing worked.  His training was rough to say the least.  This thing works wonders if used correct.  And even in the creeks.  My dog now walks off leash and listens to my every word.  Definitely recommend.,5
"e have bought these treats for a long time and our dogs liked them and they have good ingredients. Recently, the packaging changed and the product inside also did. They have always been a ""crunchy"" type treat but now they are literally hard as a rock. I noticed my dogs struggling to eat them and tried to break one myself...couldn't do it! I actually ordered them again thinking I just got a bad batch but no, the new batch was just as hard. doggie dental bills are not cheap and these are so hard I really was concerned they were going to break a tooth.",2
"This is a mess-saving miracle. I have this hung in front of my largest cage opening and love how it keeps the seed mess *inside* the feeder! My only problem is that the hooks that hold it on are too curved and make it difficult to get off when it comes time to clean it out and add new seed. But, those hooks are so tough that I can't get them bent out more despite trying with pliers (I'll have to see if a man can get it with their stronger hands), so I can at least tell you that the stubbornest bird won't get them off, either. My cockatiel doesn't try, so I don't worry about him. If your bird would, then leave them alone and just fiddle with them until they come off (they eventually will with patience and persistence).",5
"Moving our dog from Orijen, simply due to cost. He seems to enjoy this food just as much, and the ingredients aren't too bad (though not as comprehensive or 'all natural' as Orijen). The caveat being that the pieces of kibble are very small. I actually double checked the bag to make sure it wasn't for cats. The kibble size may not be a problem for most dogs, but our pup tends to inhale his food without chewing much (if at all). Just a small concern. May have to throw a ball in his bowl to slow down his eating. Otherwise, pretty happy.",4
"I have been giving this to my three doggies for two years. I mix it into the food (Wellness Core Grain Free reduced fat) every morning, plus Halo Glo, Missing link and pure pumpkin. There are feels like velvet and they are healthy as can be! Love this product!",5
"I have been buying this food for my dog for over a year.  It is not available locally, so I have to order it online.  Before I was feeding my dog a different, cheaper brand and he would get dry skin.  Since changing to this food his dry skin has cleared up.  Because it is high in proteens he eats less, so the actual cost of feeding him, a large newfounland, has gone down.  This 30lb bag lasts about 6-7 weeks...I fill a large automatic feeder that allows him to eat as much, or as little, as he wants.  His energy level has also gone up, and he is a very lean dog.  He really likes it, which was a big consern because he is so picky, he won't even eat milk bones or pigs ears!
I would recommend this quality dog food to anyone who really cares about their pets!",5
"I purchased four of these balls. Two large and two medium size.  I returned the medium size because they were smaller than the 2 1/2 inches described and they would be dangerous balls for my dogs.  I also ordered a Chuckit Mega Ball Launcher for use with the large balls.  The large balls are not 3 1/2 inches as described.  They are slightly more than 4 inches and do not fit the launcher. Great balls, very light weight, my dog loves them and they look like they will last a long time.  When hand thrown they travel far. I will purchase them again if they are offered in a size somewhere between the Medium and Large size.",3
This bedding is amazing!!  Goes for a long time without smelling bad.,5
My dog loves the squeaking of these balls.,5
Doesn't work and dogs won't drink it.  Terrible stuff.,1
fit perfect on the cage I have it.,5
"I bought this before I received my puppy so I wasn't sure how she'd take it...she loves it, she gnaws on it, she sleeps on it and she plays with it. It is tiny so it be aware of the size, definitely not for a bigger puppy.",5
"I love Oxbow food and hay for my bunnies and I feel good that they're receiving the nutrition they need. Buns need hay at all times and a small amount of pellets each day to supplement their nutritional needs. Their feeding recommendations have worked out quite well for all 3 of my buns and they go crazy when it's time for their pellets, so they must taste pretty good, too!",5
I have one in all 6 of my tanks do I have to say any more??? low cost and simple to use,5
"I wanted something natural and healthy to feed my pups. I tried feeding my older dog ""Blue"", but he would eat around the vitamin-filled blue bits!! It was a complete waste money. I have 8 and 5 year old beagles who devour this food! I have a subscription for this, so I can save a little extra money.",5
I have a fussy poodle and he loves these chew bones plus I get the satisfaction of knowing I am helping to keep his teeth healthy.,5
"My dog did love the bone.  We sawed it down to make it smaller, but she still was not impressed with this bone.  She is a chewer, so thought this would keep her occupied for a while, but she did not like it much.",3
"We have now purchased three of these, two from the same vendor (Bvanki). We started with just one and ordered two more. These are really well made. The wire inside of the rope is thick and strong so it keeps it's spring but can be shaped however you want it. There is a little carabiner at one end and a bell at the other. Our Eclectus loves playing with the bell and seems to enjoy bouncing along with the coil of the rope. We replaced her standard dowel perches in her cage with these because she struggled a little climbing up the sides of her wrought iron cage. This worked great. Well made, well packaged and the delivery was prompt.",5
"can't beat it for the price. As others have said, the pull string gets frayed easy, but I replaced it with some gutted paracord.",4
"Have been using these and what can i say ....
theyve been great, theres no question they fit my unit and at the price they offered it was a no brainer.",5
Love this but when my dogs hair grew out a bit it did pull her hair. Great for short hair tho,4
My puppy likes this so much and I like the price.,5
These seem to work great. I recently moved by plants around a little and I was very pleased at the amount and health of the root systems.  I had an algae bloom (that was my fault) that latched onto the leaves so they weren't doing as well.  I think the really healthy roots saved the plants. I will definitely buy this again.,5
"Each of our 4 dogs LOVE this toy.  It has not had an issue with the chewers going for the box either.  My dogs, at least, know the difference between squeaking toys and voicebox toys.  They have not attempted to rip out the voicebox - we've lost a leg but that's it.  It is fairly well constructed as well.  I ordered one and sent to my daughter and we've ordered some other ""dudes"" to have around.  Absolutely another great toy by Multipet.",5
Soft wood pellets work much better with this box. No reason to throw out kitty diapers.,3
Great quality dog food. My morkie loves it!,5
"I had no idea these existed. I had a specific need and went on a search. So glad I found this! Apparently I am not the only one with this specific problem!  It is super sturdy (when installed according to the directions- I saw another reviewer who tried to put the screw directly into the drywall and wondered why it came out.) It keeps my dogs out of the ""kitty room"" so they cannot get to the litter boxes while allowing the cats full access to the room without worrying about them getting shut in there. Genius product. Sturdy, strong, and well made. It makes my life so much easier.",5
My dog LOVES it!! Heavy chewer. Unfortunately it's the material that hurts to touch after it's been chewed on a bit though.,4
Nice play toy for my girls.  Love that it lights up...so much fun!,5
"My vet recommended this product for my cat, who'd developed an intestinal blockage from grooming his long, fluffy fur.  None of the usual hairball remedies had had any effect whatsoever, and he was miserable.  Within a few days of starting FortiFlora, he returned to his usual, active self, and his coat and eyes actually appeared healthier and brighter.

Over the last few years, I've found that whenever our cats seem to be lacking in vitality, a course of FortiFlora tends to perk them up.  Apparently, they just don't get these microbes in their diet, or else something in their environment--maybe city water--is killing the flora in their gut and it needs to be beefed back up periodically.  FortiFlora seems to really help with their ""recovery"" from vaccinations, too.

I'm generally skeptical of this kind of product; expensive, and with generalized health benefit claims that aren't really explained well.  However, I also believe that if experience says it works, then it works.  I'd definitely recommend this product.  I give the canine version to my dog, too, when she seems to be ""off"" in her energy or gut.  She gets the same benefits as the cats.",5
Couldn't go wrong with this.,5
These were amazing for my handicapped cart dog. Nicely protected his toes from dragging and kept them warm too!,5
"My dog has a multitude of allergies, so finding a treat without ""Chicken By Products"" is a chore.  My dog is 82 pounds but I still don't like giving him large treats.  This one is the perfect size.  I can give him multiple if I think he needs it.",5
"My cat has mega colon and occasionally has issues where we'll need to clean her up a bit.  She doesn't like a lot of products but this one she doesn't mind, it must be extremely gentle.",5
"We have two of these devices, one for each dog. They provide a safe way to transport our dogs, who accept them without objection and who enjoy the relative freedom to move that they offer. I recommend them highly.",5
This filter stopped working about 5 weeks after I bought it. I tried cleaning it out but the motor was dead. I had to replace it.,1
"the only brand that doesn't break after a couple of months. Our cat has one for 6 months now, and we removed it and replaced it quite often (about once a week) and it's still working like a charm (note that we change the color for an orange one: [...]",5
"This perch is described as small, but it's really a pretty good size for little birds. It's about 5 inches wide and a little under 2 inches thick, sticking out about 5 to 6 inches when installed.

The surface is rough for beak and claw maintenance, but not too tough for standing on. My conure likes to wipe her beak on it when it is placed near her food dish and hops on it while cruising around her cage, but does not really use it as a long-time perch, per se.

Definitely nice quality and worth adding to your cage.",5
Nice bowls for your favorite feline and the price was right.  The design is cute and they are easily washable.,5
I received his thermometer yesterday. Although I have three aquariums I am using this to help me monitor the temperature of water in a plant cloning machine. It is dead on with the floating thermometer I was using except now with this thermometer I can get a clear accurate reading without having to dig the thermometer out of the reservoir! Thermometer has a nice long cord with the option of attaching the unit with either a nail/screw or the included suction cup. It also has a suction cup for mounting the sensor. The thermometer uses one button cell battery and has a power button and the option to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The price is insanely cheap to not buy this!,5
"I was a repeat customer and used to recommend this cat toy very highly.  It's the ONLY toy one of my cats was ever interested in playing with.  I've bought SEVERAL of them in store and online via Amazon.

However...  The length of last few I've purchased have been significantly shorter making it difficult to engage my cat in play the way I used to.  I would drag it across the floor and she would chase it in figure 8 fashion.  It was a great way for her to burn off energy.  That's too difficult to do now that the wire is so much shorter.

The cat still loves the toy, but me...  Not so much.",2
I have six dogs and it helps my grass stay green.  Without this product I don't think my grass would be ashealthy as it is.,5
"No litter is perfect. This litter is the most dust free litter I have tried, and it tracks far less than the others as well. It has a completely neutral smell right out of the bag. Our small apartment requires that the litter box sits in our living room, and while I scoop 1 to 2 times a day, the odor control isn't as good as some. I've found myself a perfect medium by mixing a little bit of the more expensive and dusty World's Best in with this.",4
"Let me start by saying I've got two cats. Both male. Atticus is a year old (weighing about 14lbs - he's huge), Pekoe is about 8 months (weighing about 8lbs). I got this toy hoping it would entice Atticus, as Pekoe started stealing all the action on the feather tickler that was previously Atticus' favorite toy. Right out of the Amazon box I loved this toy. Their packaging was simple, clean, effective. And it's designed to be a toy too! (More on that later). As I unpacked it and set up the track, both boys were more interested in that track than the unexplored Amazon box on the floor nearby. If you're buying this... and you buy from Amazon... odds are you know how much it means when the cat is more interested in what came out of the box than the box itself. They both had fun with it for nearly a solid hour after it was assembled. It's been a few months now and they both still play with it periodically, I'd say probably at least daily, maybe for about 5-10 minutes at a time. It is without any doubt their most returned to toy (they have tons), and that is only partly due to the fact it can't get lost (like their beloved catnip mice).

About the box. The box the toy came it was designed to have holes cut out to make it a ""treat maze"" (big hole the cat can put its head in, small holes for paws) and it had a cute pirate chest design on it. The holes were marked a little too small - the smaller of my cats got his head stuck getting a treat out. I re-cut it a little bigger and they both continued to be mildly intrigued, but overall it wasn't great for treats. What it did work great for was toys! I put some pompoms in and they went nuts batting them around trying to get them out. Every day or so I put them back in and they find them all over again. And that's another thing about it... that box still looks about like it did the day it arrived. It was built to last a while.

I will definitely buy more from this company again. They're great, their products are great! I love it and the boys love it!",5
"Although the idea is fine - brushing all surfaces at once - the problem is the head of the tooth brush was just too big for my dog's mouth even though the appropriate size was bought.  It was hard to get into her mouth then harder still to get her to open her mouth wide enough so that I could brush her teeth.

I actually like the old generic flat head type the best.  However, just to be fair I will try a QuadBrush for small dogs.  As it stands right now.",1
My little dog will eat these but would rather have soft treats.,3
"I have three cats, each one likes a different flavor.",4
"must be old, used this type before & worked well, not these",2
very nice,5
Sent 2 extra snails. One did die and I've still got the rest a couple months later.,5
"My goldfish and mountain minnows go insane over this food. It makes the tank a wee bit cloudy, bit thats okay.",5
I rotate between buying these and the 4-6 inch ones. I buy whatever is cheaper at the time. my doggies love them. I haven't met a dog that doesn't love these.,5
"Perfect for my squirell. She climbs on them and chews them to file her  teeth down. Unfortunately, a couple of them have loosened from the metal locking stand which has resulted in them slipping off and not staying stationary.",4
Monroe didn't seem to care as much for these as she did the chicken jerky curls. She is eating them but not enthusiastically,2
"What can I say other than my cat is addicted to Fancy Feast? It is an ongoing addiction that goes back almost 15 years. I buy her the beef and poultry varieties. But as soon as I walk in my home (regardless of the time of day) she starts vocalizing her desire for a can of Fancy Feast and does not stop until she obtains it. She even runs back and forth between me and where I store the cans, just in case I have forgotten their location.

The box of canned cat food in the correct variety was promptly delievered. The price is comparable to the standard prices in the store (without a sale or coupons).",5
Works great. Strong and easy to clean,5
"Just ordered my second set.  I buy the medium for my 13 pound Pom.  Evidently I put them on ""wrong side out"" as I put the brown/tan side out, but the Velcro works very well and he hasn't been able to get out of them.  I do line them with an incontinence pad since I put it on when I leave for work and don't get home for 8 hours.  I can't keep him from marking since I'm gone all day and these have resolved the issues.  I have tried the pet store brand with elastic and like these much better, especially since they are only about half the price.",5
Was broken out of the box,1
GEAT PRODUCT FOR DOGS THAT HAVE STOMACH ISSUES.,5
It tore apart the first time my dog played with it. Get the original Kong ball instead. That one has lasted us for years.,1
"My pooch loves these and waits for one when she gets up in am and at night when she heads to bed
I like they are made in USA
she also has 4 other treats made in usa and knows which one she wants when ;)",5
"I have a shih-tzu who was constantly getting ear infections despite dietary adjustments and being careful not to get water into her ears. Her vet bills were killing me. So I went to Amazon for relief. This is what I found and with so much praise, I gave it a try. All the reviews are accurate. When applied weekly to every 2 weeks, it calms her ears down and the scratching, redness, and terrible smell all go away. It gets replaced with the smell of this ear wash, which I do not particularly like but it is a whole lot better than the smell of an infected ear.",5
My three cats love this--although the older one threw up after eating it for the first few servings.  She's okay with it now and prefers the flavor over the other cat food we had for cats with sensitive stomachs.  These style has smaller bits of meat which my cats prefer to the other fancy feast gravy meals we bought that had 1/4 inch meat chunks--our cats are lazy and hate larger sized bits.  will purchase again.,5
"Great Product, it was easy to set up similar than a ladder. The carpet has sticker on one side easy to place on the steps, it is made in USA.
it tooks a little training for my cats to step on since I am changing from an ottoman to those steps but easier for them to use it. Extremely light weight can be fold and put under the bed or in a closet. If you have a hardwood floor you can buy some velcro with tape on the back and put it at the bottom of the steps and place the other side on the floor this will prevent the steps to move when your cat or dog step on it. Great product",5
"I expected better. I take really good care of this thing -- wash it weekly, replace the filters, keep the water level high enough... and it just started making noise. It runs louder than it should. I'm guessing it will need a new motor house soon. I've only had the fountain for a couple months, not even!",2
"I have been given my small dog this oil for about 3 weeks now and I haven't seen any change in his itching.  I had high hopes.  He's five years old an has always had skin allergies and the only thing that actually works is steroids and Apoquel, both of which are basically poison.  I'll keep giving him this oil until I've used it all because I find it highly unlikely that it can do little to no harm.  I won't buy it again though.",2
"They are made well and I'm sure a good product, but my betta has yet to even notice it.",5
"Great food, which our kitties have eaten pretty well for a while, but when presented with other (I guess better tasting) cat foods, they pretty much quit eating this. Still, it's an excellent food.",4
"We we're given the Hide-A-Squirrel as a gift from a family member when we got a new puppy. She said it was her dog's favorite toy. My wife and I just laughed at it - but then we gave it to our 8-week old pup and he absolutely loved it! It immediately became his favorite toy. We keep it on top of his crate, and give it to him to play with as a reward for being good. It's good at keeping his attention better than most his other toys as well since he can go back and forth from squirrel to tree to squirrel.",5
He LOVES this bone.  Sleeps with it and takes it everywhere he goes.  Great toy for a heavy chewer. Great product!!!,5
"The poor shrimp. They swim around for two weeks, and then became seditary. I finally felt bad enough that I set up a tank for them. One was dead when I received the sphere but two remained. Those two seem much, much happier in their new tank.",1
Good price and a durable toy even for constant chewers.,5
This has really worked for my yappy little yorkie!,5
"My dogs loved this ball for the whole 3 days it was a ball.  I have two labs and it was destroyed in a few days, but it sure smelt good. They still carry it around it's just a flat piece of plastic now but they still love it.",5
"The scoop part was average in size, but the slits were thin and it took a very long time to sift out poops and clumps.",3
"Really nice bed, I originally bought it for my 100lbs german shepherd with hip issues but he prefers his cooling mat instead so our GSD puppy has taken it over instead. She has a ways to go before she fills it up but she can stretch out and still not be off the bed. Like the removable cover and waterproof inner cover and its already saved us once after a ""puppy accident"".",5
"My Irish Terrier is about 22"" high at the shoulder. The breed is naturally bigger around the chest. He's 40 lbs. In the world of dogs, I would categorize him as a medium-sized dog.  However, size LARGE in this harness is what fits him.  Our old harness, though similar in size, was very rigid in it's sewing and spanned too far across the front of his chest. This ended up rubbing on the inside of his front legs.  He didn't say this was the reason he didn't like it [wink] but appeared to me, a contributing factor to the irritation. THIS harness, however, was thoughtfully designed with the dog in mind.  It's light, yet sturdy enough where it needs to be and it does not rub or irritate. My dog doesn't mind wearing this one. The quality is very good. For those few who claim it isn't, I'd bet it's the dog who takes THEM for a walk and not the other way around; they got other problems. In the final analysis, this harness provides an effective, light weight, comfortable fit your dog will surely appreciate. The price make this an excellent value!",5
"Its a clicker, had to try it.  But I'm too old on my ways.",3
My dogs love these antlers! They are clean with no sharp edges. Definitely will buy again!,5
"Before I sing the praises of this wonderfully innovative item, I want to address the size:  Several reviewers spoke about it being large & yes, it is quite tall.  BUT the height can be reduced by nearly half!
There are three segments: the top piece that fits into the intake pipe, & two lower segments that each house a separate sponge filter. While both barrels have identical perimeter openings, the upper barrel has openings in the bottom, & the lowest segment has a solid (closed) bottom to prevent substrate from being pulled into it.
If you need a shorter version of the pre-filter, disassemble the pieces & remove the middle segment.  Snap the (top) inlet piece onto the bottom segment, & Voila!  No more size problem!

If you're  wondering if it's worthwhile,  I offer you a resounding YES!  It will save you hours of time & a substantial cost savings because the filter media will last longer.
Another consideration is that your expensive canister filter will last longer because there's less wear & tear on the water valve /  connection mechanisms.

It is most helpful for the occasional oops of too much food or the
""snowfall"" of hose film when restarting the filter.  Whatever the oops, this little jewel will clear it up in short order & you can just rinse it off when it's done its job.",5
Our senior lab responded well to this supplement during our last road trip. These allowed him to settle in to new places quietly and quickly.,4
It is so easy to give to my cat. I just mix it in his food and he eats it no problem.,5
"I get it. I'm not the one eating it so I shouldn't care... but there was a clear gel all around the meat inside the package. It didn't resemble a liquid at all and was not like any broth I've ever seen. It didn't appear natural looking at all and honestly looked like someone took old cans of cat food from the 90s (with gel inside) and blender-ed them into a pouch.

I prefer [Insert Other Well Known Brand That I won't Mention Here] pouches that actually look like edible food for my cat.  Some other pouches have broth that appears like broth and is a lot lighter looking.

PROS:
- Quick snack packs for kitties who need a treat
- They do have a lot of vitamins and things older cats need
- The smell was strong and potent

CONS:
- The gel inside was off putting
- The smell was so strong that it actually seemed wrong
- There was barely any broth outside of the gel itself
- The size of the package is tiny (similar to other -treat- pouches though)

Overall, it felt like premium pricing for a cat treat without the premium quality.",2
I am not sure what they put in the treat that caused my two dogs Bischon Frise vomiting.,1
Kitties didn't mind this in their food and it didn't affect them negatively at all.,5
Lots of fun but not the most durable if you have a chewer. Was ripped in a week .,4
"Orders these for my rats and they went crazy for them , they are a little difficult to get into as they're individually wrapped inside the bag, lol . But they didn't last long once I passed them out.",5
"Hard to get the top off, if there is a small air leak then you won't realize it later until the floor is covered with water.  Awkward to lift, sealing depends on an O-ring that they provide a baggy full but now I have to reorder more.  I fill up the bowl each night for them.",3
"OK -you all know I have four cats by now and I have no children. I have bought about EVERY cat product listed on AMAZOM. I am an RN and aboutely manic about cleanness. I have limited time and want the products I buy to preform the  function I bought them for, not one one my cats even looked at this product?? I have not reason why?",2
"Thank god for this. Fits in the bathroom corner under the sink. Has a lower opening in the middle so less-able cats can get in and out. However, it will not stop cats determined to do so from peeing over the top. And not stop cats from kicking litter out the middle. I use 1 40 lb kitty litter bag in here for optimal depth.",5
"I kept believing that it is normal for my dog to continue to pull me while he was walking because he was a excited puppy. After two and a half years and 58 pounds of pure muscle, my back and arms couldn't take it anymore. I heard good things about the Gentle Leader and wanted to try all products that could help. I purchased this a month ago and laughed at how small the clips and straps were because when i previously walk my dog, I need a full harness to prevent him from busting loose. In any case, with lots of anxiety I took him out for a walk. Instantly, I was surprised how he slowed down and stopped pulling. Although he is pretty upset that he doesn't have as much control of the walk and the harness is around his nose, he is doing fine. I would say after two uses he stopped trying to pull it off his face and after 5 walks he stopped most of the head jerking.

Best of all, my wife can walk the dog without me. She used to worry that he would just pull her to ground and drag her if he chased a bunny.",5
"Great way to keep your dog or puppy busy. Treats can be placed inside and the dog has to work to get the snacks out. It makes noise as the treats roll around inside to keep the dog's interest up, plus the scent of the treat can come through the holes. Remember puppies can be a bundle of trouble, so keep them busy with this treat/toy.",5
Tree frog loves it!,5
"I have an 8lb shih tzu. I was concerned these 4"" chews would be far too big for her tiny mouth. She didn't touch the chew for a week. Then all of a sudden she began licking/chewing for hours at a time. She LOVES them. Best of all they aren't constipating her like rawhide did. I just ordered more.  We are new fans 4ever!!",5
"I love this stuff over Feliway mostly because it's cheaper and smells great! Feliway doesn't have a smell which is what some people want, but this stuff is awesome. It really helped when my Boo had surgery and had to stay in a cage for 2 weeks. He was freaking out until I got this plug in and he camled right down.",5
very good fish food,5
"My cat loves this bed! I put a piece of cotton bedding in the bottom, to make it cozy and warm. He spends half the day curled up in his bed, looking out the window. I bought the medium, and my cat has plenty of room.",5
"nice cage, somewhat easy to assemble with just picture instructions.",4
Can't beat the price. This is going to last me a long time with my 3G planted betta tanks. As recommended by other reviewers: be careful with dosing READ THE DIRECTIONS to avoid algae blooms and refrigerate after opening if open for 3+ months!,5
I use Show Off No Rinse Shampoo between regular baths for facial hair and any collection of urine on side coat on the fully coated boys and behinds on the girls.  Works great,5
"I bought this because of the great reviews. It is the worst litter I ever had. It was all over the place, dusty and did not really clump well. And because of that you could smell the litter box all through the house. My cats hated it too and wouldn't want to go to the litter box for a whole day until I changed the litter.",1
"purchased based upon other reviews, far to early to see if there is a difference",4
"I bought this harness because I could definitely tell my dog did not like the initial harness. This was is soft and it seems comfortable.
It's easy to put on, and easy to adjust. I find that it stretched a little bit from my dog pulling on his leash, but nothing that it majorly affected the harness. Super cute colors available too. I bought the matching leash that was available as well.
I also want to mention that I bought the size Medium, I have a maltipoo and weights 11 lbs. It fits him fine and it's also adjustable.",5
"My cat gives these two paws up.... he loves them, and I love that they are grain free. I also like that they are made in the USA from a safety perspective. The only strange thing is that compared to Greenies these are very small - the size of regular food instead of treats. Not a show stopper but worth calling out.

Hope this helps.",5
Very good,5
My cat loved it fine quality catnip,5
My RCS shrimp love them and my Gouramis too. Well packaged and fresh.,5
Well made and strong. Does the job,5
"Nice height, strong durable table. Shelf underneath is nice touch. The rubber surface gives the dogs comfort, they were not slipping around like they did on the counter top. The clamp worked well I bought one of the harnesses with 2 loops. On the negative side the shelf needed some slight bending, and the brackets that hold it to the table also needed some bending. Don't expect one without any dings mine had 2 or 3 in it but it still looks pretty nice. I would just expect a few dings when it comes. It is kind off heavy for the packaging. I do recommend this product, it works great on medium sized dogs. It looks good to, just don't look too close.",5
Super fast shipping - as described - VERY happy?,4
My cats love this water fountain.  They never drink from a regular water bowl anymore.,5
Dogs Love them!  Perfect if they have upset stomach too.  And helps breath!,5
I've had this one in a 3-gallon tank for 1 week.  It works pretty good.  The only bad thing is its alittle hard to read but other than that it stays and reads good.,4
This product made a difference with training my puppy. I have a lot of control and she can not scrape it off easily.,5
"This is a nice, double-pronged flea comb with the added amenity of an LED light. It works very well as just a comb - it's great for brushing a dog's hair and mine apparently liked the feel of this comb. As for the LED effect, it's OK but something of a gimmick - unless you plan to search for fleas only in dark areas - say, while walking your dog late at night, in the park - I doubt I'll use that feature all that much. In addition, I wish that the comb had come with the batteries included - for this price point, it would have been nice if they had been included instead of being an extra expense.",4
Work great!,5
Perfect fitting for my dog over her diaper. She's nearing 104 years old and has incontinency for a while now. These cover ups keep her diaper on and they match her clothes. They are the answer to my problems. LOVE them!,5
"This was a great deal for under $40, it is not as tall as it appears, sitting on the floor it just reaches the wondow ledge, but my cats like it and the leopard print is cool",4
Broke fairly quickly.,3
"My dog can destroy a soft toy in minutes (if not seconds) but isn't very interested in Kongs or nylabones. He loves his Bristle Bone! The white part smells like vanilla or something, not stinky like the Kong, and he loves the challenge of the little disks. It's his favorite toy.",5
"Very impressed with this collar! I have a 75 lb German shepherd puppy and this has been what I needed to stop some annoying behaviors! There is more than enough room with this collar to adjust to an even bigger dog than mine, I think it could easily work for a 150 lb dog. I love that it has varying ways to remotely control the dog so it's not just shocking your pet. I use the sound feature inside to help remind my puppy that cats are our friends and not moving meowing chew toys. The vibration I do have up high to grab her attention but I think she's just a very determined dog with a thick furry neck. I use this to remind her she is not a lap dog when guests are over and they really don't want their faces licked. And finally the dreaded shock part.. No I don't have the courage to shock myself to see how hard it zaps. I only put it low on her (10) and I use it when we go for walks. She is sure my arm is extendable and I can stay safely on the sidewalk while she and my arm go chase a squirrel, an unsuspecting rabbit, or even take flight and catch a bird. All it takes is one zap, a firm vocal command, and we look like a respectable well behaved puppy walking down your street. After a few days I was able to only use vibrate on her instead of the shock and that works just as good as the first zap I sent her. I HIGHLY recommend this if you have a determined stubborn dog that defiantly believes that all small furry creatures are chew toys, their large bodies will fit on your lap, or would like to run down the street chasing animals, mailmen, school buses, and the monster garbage truck all with your arm attached to the leash. In under one week, this made a HUGE difference in eliminating unwanted behaviors that training couldn't seem to get through her beautiful thick head, and letting us enjoy our puppy for the sweet rug chewing and shoe remodeler/destroyer that she is!! I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend you buy it!! It has changed my dog into a better more behaved version of herself in such a short time! My only regret is I didn't buy one earlier as I may still have my black leather boots..",5
Nice,5
"My dog, Puppy, love it",5
My lovebird really enjoys this food. I alternate every time I buy it with the other brand that looks just like this. I do this to ensure my bird is getting perfect 100% nutrition. Much less mess. The Bird eats the whole piece of kibble. Don't have to wonder if the birds getting perfect nutrition or Not by picking out what they like. Seeds are great for treats,5
"My heathen hounds love these Canine Carry Out treats. Even my persnickety boy who is pretty sure every treat contains a trick. These are single bite size, soft nibbles for my Ridgebacks. To be honest, these are essentially junk food due to corn, wheat and soy in the ingredients list. Certainly not for everyday and if I use these as training rewards, I do break them in half. But....my pack loves them and they are inexpensive, so I buy them a big bag at least once a month and have for several years.",4
"Our cat was totally intrigued for a minute and then got bored. Could never rekindle his interest. We gave it to our neighbors and their cat didn't take to it, either. Disclaimer: We have a high maintenance play aggressive 1.5 year old who has only sustained interest in feather toys, string toys, and ping pong balls.",1
My little doge love these sticks.  They are good for their teeth and my doge think they are treats.  Highly recommend.,5
Just another stuffed animal like any other. My dog loved it.,4

It's light weight and comfortable for him. I like that the muzzle is soft, as he will sometimes come running towards me and bump into me playfully. He is able to drink water, take food from my hand and pant with this muzzle. I use it for when he visits the vet and for walks. I don't use it when he runs along side my bicycle, as I feel he will need more panting room for that activity. But he does use it during free running as he sets his own pace. It's very easy to clean. It has now been a year and a half since I bought it. It still is in great condition. I have it in the black color. I'm thinking of now buying it in the tan color as my dog is white and the black one stands out too much on him.

Overall, I really like this muzzle and would definitely recommend it.",5
Excellent cat litter box for our one cat.  No more cat litter on the floor.  The cat came out of nowhere and jumped into it as soon as we took it out of the box and put the surround cover on it (we just wanted to look at it before taking it downstairs).  He must have known it was for him.,5
Good treat.,5
Excellent,4
"I've tried many, many litter systems in the 16 years since we rescued our first cat. With each one I was hopeful for something less messy, less stinky, and less expensive. I've always insisted on using non-clay alternatives, so I wanted something that was ""healthy."" I won't make this a long review by mentioning all the different litter boxes and litters I've tried. We have 5 cats (one being the 16 yr. old that started everything : ) and we go through litter like crazy. We usually spend about $60/mo. on litter. And then I bought the TIDY CAT BREEZE LITTER BOX KIT. Its a different idea than traditional litter systems. I'm sure other reviewers will go into detail of the specifics so I won't go through all that. Basically, the poo stays above and the urine goes through the holes to a separate area which contains a pad (kind of like a diaper). Its very easy to scoop the poo out of the box. Although they say the pads should be replaced once a week for each cat but I've found I can get away with about 4-5 days until I have to change the pad. Changing the pad can't be any easier... pull out the tray hold it over the waste can and let the pad slide into the garbage. The tray even stays clean because the pads run up the sides keeping the urine on the pad. We've had this system for about 3 weeks and all my cats are using it now. My one male wasn't too sure about it and took a little longer for him but he eventually got the hang of it. The litter box even stays amazingly clean (as far as litter boxes go). There's also no tracking of litter. The only thing you may find is a random pellet here and there on the floor and I just pick them up and through them back into the box. The bag of pellets should be changed once a month. The bag costs less than $9.00 and a package of 4 pads casts less than $9.00. So we went from about $60/mo. to about $24/mo. I'm thrilled with this system. It's like no other.",5
Great price but can't say it works yet haven't used it.,5
As advertised. Cat loves them.,4
My dog ate these when we first got them.  Now she just buries them all over the house.  I don't know what that means.  Are they too precious to eat?,4
"My cat is a healthy adult and he's not on any diet restrictions, but recently the vet recommended trying dry food that's not as hard on the teeth. I've been incorporating another softer food, and I wanted him to try this one as well.

My cat is also rather picky when it comes to food and treats, but he has received 9 Lives pretty well thus far. It doesn't pack the same crunch that his original food does, which is better for the teeth.

I have no idea if this will help my cat lose weight (even though he doesn't need to), but it will be interesting to see if there are any changes in the long run. This brand is rather affordable, although I don't particularly like seeing corn products in the ingredients of a meat diet.",4
"This won't work for my average to normal size cats. It wobbles when I put them on it, and the shelves are too small to lay on or jump down to.  I gave it to a friend who has very active 6 month old kittens.  They climb it like a tree trunk to get to the shelves, and it works for them.",2
"Easy to assemble, sturdy and the perfect height for my medium sized dog. She seems much more comfortable eating from this feeding tray as opposed to bending down to eat. Just make sure to wipe it down once in a while because the tan surface does collect dog hair/dirt.",5
"When my dog was an active, playful puppy, he'd occasionally come up limping.  I'd panic and take him to the vet to make sure nothing was seriously wrong, and after the 2nd or 3rd time, they suggested he use glucosamine.  Of course, they mentioned the expensive brand, which I used for a while... then I found these, which were significantly cheaper, and found they worked as well, if not better than the other.

He is now a healthy 9 year old dog and he hasn't had any of the issues from when he was younger, and when I put one of these in his bowl every breakfast, it's the first thing he eats.

The huge supply lasts 8 months or so for my dog (larger dogs may take more so run out faster), and the chews stay soft and fresh as long as you close the bag.

I figured all these years of daily use deserved a review, and it's absolutely a 5-star product.",5
Cats love this stuff. It still is one of their favorites. We rotate it in their diet along with organic foods and other stuff. But they sure love this. And it is a great price to buy it here on Amazon.,5
clouds up my clean water immediately,2
Comes quickly and I love Blue Buffalo!!!!,5
"This plant looks exactly as it did when I put it into the tank two years ago.  It's made to last.  One caveat:  it's flat and it can't be fluffed out.  I once put it too close to the wall and my little (1.5 inch) baby betta got stuck behind it.  I found him in time, so he wasn't hurt at all.  As far as I know, this is the brand to look for when buying artificial aquarium plants.",5
I like it. My dragon hates it.,4
I HAD HEARD A VET TECH SUGGEST THESE & I LOOKED TO AMAZON FOR A GOOD PRICE/DEAL & FOUND IT.  THIS PRODUCT HELPED HEAL MY DOXIE'S BACK FROM IVDD DISEASE & I GIVE IT TO THE HEALTHY ONE ALSO.  I AM ALMOST FINISHED WITH THE FIRST BAG & THEN WILL BE GIVING THEM EVERY OTHER DAY AS INSTRUCTED FOR THE PRODUCT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE THAT HAS A DOG WITH IVDD DISEASE.  IT WILL ALWAYS BE IN MY ARSENAL OF HEALING FOR DOGS.,5
"I have many brushes and combs for my champion Himalayan, but this one is the best!  It is well made and gets the mats out without hurting him.  Highly recommend!",5
Got moldy too fast,1
this works well!,5
"So far it is very effective. I own 3 very barky chihuahuas & my neighbors have 3 dogs that bark at me the second I walk out my back door which is quite often. No offense to anyone but it seems that the smarter the dog the better it works. My neighbor's Aussie is highly intelligent & it works like a charm but has no effect on his two Westies as they seem to bark at anything, everything & even the wind but the Aussie barks to get attention. Now on my 3 chi chi's it seems to work best on the one I percieve to be the smarter of the bunch.  Maybe over time this will not be the case but as others have said I can pull out the can & say harshly ""NO!"" & they retreat or stop barking. So it seems it varies based on the individual dog (not their breed) or their personalities. The only downside is I hardly ever have the can in reach when I need it but there are times when I know for sure the barking will start so I can grab the can ahead of time & be prepared. This is no fault of the product its just I might need to buy a smaller can to be able to carry it around in my pocket.",5
Thank you,5
"Unfortunately I can't buy this anymore, because we found out our dog is allergic to some of the ingredients. But he loves this kibble and never got bored with the flavor like he did with other brands.",5
cant wait to use it. I probably won't use it much as she fell in and swam fine but is scared to get in and swim. loves the water so I cannot wait to have her use this and see she is safe. I figure maybe a few times and I can not use the float but great teaching device and if we go on the river for kayacking it will be a good safety for her. worth the price,5
"My 11 year old Greyhound Kingsley loves these. His regular glucosamine tablets from Osteo Pet work great on his aches and pains but give him ghastly, turn-the-air-green, asphyxiate-everyone-in-the-room gas, so I started mixing them with these from NaturVet. While not quiiiite as effective on their own for his pain, when mixed with the Osteo Pet, they're the perfect combo for him. No pain, no gas, everybody wins!",5
This doesn't control the order as well as other brands.,3
"I purchased this at Walmart yesterday and not one of my four cats shows any interest in this.  All my cats love catnip but this catnip ball is a complete zero from their perspective.  This does not even smell like catnip to my nose.  My boyfriend and I were stunned that the cats had no reaction. We even put water on it and tried grating it and still nothing.

UPDATE March 28, 2015 - The company sent me a couple of new balls and two catnip flasks with catnip in them. My cats loved the catnip but with regard to the balls, they were only marginally interested. They showed no interest in the ball I purchased at Walmart but with the ones the company sent I got a slight reaction.  Unfortunately, these are still not a hit with my cats.  However, they do like the organic catnip they sent.  They give that 4 stars as they reserve 5 stars for the catnip I sometimes grow for them (which they go crazy for).",2
"My puppy loves these!  These treat are excellent, and they smell good enough to eat, you can tell Old Mother Hubbard truly uses quality ingredients in their products.

They're the perfect size for a puppy, I would still break them down in half (at least) that way your pup doesn't gobble through the whole bag, but overall they're a perfect treat for them.  I give my pup a couple of these at a time and he's fine, and always wanting more!  I keep a little baggie filled with these in my car and in his doggy bag so we always have them handy.  They work great as an impromptu training treat as well.",5
My little dachshund chewed a hole on the original cover. I finally got around and found there is a replacement cover for the orthoair. The replacement cover is softer than the original one and embedded with a cute paw logo. It fits perfectly. I will purchase another one just in case my dachshund decided it was delicious to chew again!!,5
Works great in our daycare when a dog needs a leash on quickly. Also perfect to leave in your vehicle if you run into a stray dog!,5
"We love this crate. It's the perfect size for our SMALL, 18 pound dog for when we are not home and at night.  This is the best price I found on the internet. Same prices for used crates on Craigslist. Why not buy a new one. And the two doors are key for different placements. Quality is very good. Puppy divider is a good idea for training. Dogs like crates if you use them properly and they are excellent for house breaking. Our dog goes in there on her own and it's helped solve our small dog house breaking.",5
No response from dog.,1
"Food was good for my doodle. His poops were always soft on this food, though - I think it was a little too rich for him. As he turned a year old, the soft poops started turning more liquid. We switched him to the adult version of this food and it seems to be going perfectly well.",4
Works great,5
I have 3 cats only 1 shows a little interest in this. I ordered lighted up balls to replace the regular ball that comes with it and I hope that makes them like it more. But it is very well made and the price is right!,4
Dog hated it and refused to eat.,3
Works great for collecting my dog's hair while she's shedding.,4
"I took a chance based on previous reviews and ordered a small size.  My Chihuahua Zorro is about 9 pounds but not fat. His chest is big and the small size is perfect.

The quality of the coat is excellent. The fleece lining is wonderful for this little fellow who loves to
be warm.

I would not hesitate to order again from this vendor.

And the price is more than reasonable!",5
"Works indoors maybe 50% of the time. Did not work to quiet neighbor dogs which was the reason we bought it.  Works on my dog, but my dog is inside and near it. We'll probably throw it away as it is too late to send back.",3
Great product for on the go and older dogs. I have a small 13 lb Chihuahua shorthaired mix. They clothes work great for her just to freshen up. She is 12 and starting to get that old doggie smell. I would not suggest this product for a long haired large dog as you would need to use a LOT of wipes. They smell fresh and have a nice scent but it takes about 3 to really clea up my very short hair small dog.,3
"Hot spots and skin issues stopped when my golden upgraded his food to this. I will always suggest Taste of the Wild over any other dog foods. I had the million dollar dog too. So, finding something that worked and kept him healthier was worth every penny! My 18 month golden now eats this food too. High in protein and some fat, just what his body needs. Fair price for a great food.",5
All of my birds enjoyed this variety.  Bargain price for the variety.  Little waste.  Will buy again.,5
My chickens are so cute wearing these.,5
"Very well made, and sturdy leash!",5
"Very sturdy, can't get to use it, cats all over it. Ordered another for me. Easy assembly.  Looks nice too.",5
"My cats love this ... especially if you put a warm, snuggly blanket on it. Oliver had to be gently placed on it before he'd use it, but Daisy was on board from the start. They take turns using it because there's only room for one of these by their favorite squirrel/bird/chipmunk viewing window. Not an ideal situation, but no fights so far. Wish they made a bunk bed!",5
"Dogs love this its amazing! So far every Zukes product is perfect, my dog gets extremely excited for these more so than any other brand of treats! Even better they are made from whole foods and don't have a lot of calories so they can be given more than others. Excellet training treats too and the price ($3.99) is amazing iys almost half off.",5
"A friend of mine bought this to slow her dog down from eating too fast.
I ended up buying it to get my fussy eater to eat more! He loves playing with the wobbler, and though he hesitates to eat food out of his bowl, he easily enjoys eating the kibble that comes out. It's even better when I hide a whole piece of bacon in there, it makes him eat all his food first, then I open it and give him the bacon.",5
"Didn't think I would like this so much but it seriously is a time saver and somewhat more ""fun"" than the manual scooping poop.",5
"This works wonders!  My dog tried to chase cars when he was a puppy and this was recommended to me.  You're supposed to push it to make the sound when they display the unwanted behavior and then reward them with a treat when they stop.  He isn't very food motivated so he didn't care at all about the treat, but stops immediately when he hears the sound.  He has since stopped trying to chase cars, but we use it anytime we're trying to stop a behavior.  It's gotten to the point where we just have to let him see the bottle and he's an angel.  I like that this one is smaller because we use it as his ""travel"" version and keep it in his backpack with his toys that we take to the park.",5
have not used it yet but seems to have a lot of options,5

My dogs absolutely love these squeaker toys and it is fairly large,5
"My girlfriend recently came across an issue where maggots were growing in her cat's food due to it not being properly sealed (disgusting, I know).

So far, it has been phenomenal in ensuring the food is kept fresh and bug free for her kitty! We'd both highly recommend this to anyone!",5
"Great product! Our chihuahua Loves these treats and at just 3 calories per treat, we don't feel bad about using them as incentives. As I write this, he was just starting to bark at someone passing by. All I had to do was say no and say ""I have Charlee Bears."" He stopped barking and came running! Lol! This 2-pack bag was a Great value and will last him a long time.",5
"This product works fine. My biggest complaint is that it drips and the bottle ends up looking disgusting after short time. It the also splatters sometimes which if you sit it in your pantry it will surely stain the cabinets. I had to keep it in a bad inside a box. Big pain and couldn't wait till it was done.

Are they all like this?",3
I have a 3.5-4 pound yorkie named Lemon. Fits perfect.,5
Received 8 marimo balls instead of 6! All arrived in good condition and different sizes. There was also clear instructions on how to take care of them when they first arrive. Currently they are all in my fish tank and make great plant decorations.,5
Purrfect.,5
"My 65-lb rottie/cattle dog mix has been on this exact formula for 7 years now. When she was 3, she had two ACL surgeries, hardware removal surgery, and then two separate meniscus surgeries. Her orthopedic surgeon told me to use this every day for the rest of her life and we have. She'll be 11 in two months and she rarely ever limps. And she still walks about a mile in the morning and a mile at night. No one can believe her age, or all she's been through with her knees. I credit both a skilled surgeon and this glucosamine formula.",5
"I have many  ""box led's""  over my reef tanks.. Some are ok.. Some are better than OK.. This one is my total favorite!  PENETRATION is 40 % better than all my others.. Very well made, and works flawlessly.. Setting it up was simple as pie...  I for sure will be looking for more of these soon!",5
Amazon stop asking me to write a product review because when I do and speak the truth you refuse to publish it even when I said my bunny loves this you wouldn't publish because I complained about the sudden increase of price,5
Two of my cats are all ready in love with this. One has been snoozing on it for several hours and I had to just go over and make sure she was still alive. The heating pad isn't very hot but its enough to keep them toasty up against the cold window! Looks like itll be easy to wash and it installed in a minute. Ill be buying another one for the living room soon!,5
My dog really likes these and they are cheaper here than at pet stores. The 1 lb bag is really big has lasted over a month so far. They are small so good for using to train my dog,5
"Good color, however it's a knock off. Not really Hamilton.",3
"I used these to contain a litter of lab pups until they were about 4 months old. The circular design keeps it from tipping over when they jump on the sides. But once they got over 30 pounds, I found that I needed to secure it to the wall because they would push it around the floor and then once they got to the couch, they could climb up and get out of it. What I did was unhook the panels and secure them with zip ties to a wire crate. That gave the pups the crate for a bedroom area and the play-yard for their pads and so forth. Secured to a wire crate, they could not drag it around because the crate was too heavy. I even bought two additional panels later when they were older and much larger. The only drawback to these is that they have a hollow construction on the interior which is a dust collector. However, just a squirt of household cleaner and a rinse with the hose and they are brand new again. Highly recommend.",5
Crumble a little bit of it over the food and your dog will love it. Even the picky eater.,5
its okay but for some reason my dog don't really play with this.. I cut some of the divisions inside to make it easier for the treats to come out but he still doesn't like it.,3
"My 12 year old siamese cat, is a picky eater.  She loves the Pro Plan Chicken and Liver Entre.  This is all she will eat.  I have tried so many different products over the last two months that she would not eat.",5
"This is wonderful! It got rid of all of the worms my dog had, quickly! It was really worth it, Lakoda needed it desperatly, and I was having a hard time justifying the $90 expense for the one the vet was suggesting.",5
It's light weight and quite sturdy as it lasted through very hot summer days and it's still fine. Our dog sadly passed away and I am able to donate it to the Humane Society in really good condition. Hope it's helping out some small dogs out there.,4
"I received my West Paw today, my dog chewed in many pieces in 15 minutes.  I will return the pieces to get a refund.",1
"Can't have a dog that chases the ball and not own this. It is very durable, throws the ball way futher than I could manage with my arm, and best of all you don't have to touch the ball when it is all slobbery and covered with mud and grass. I love this thing!",5
"I got the trap and looks good on my black dog.  I got the wrong size though, so I'll have to wait until she's a little bigger.  Great price for a quality collar",5
Cat won't eat anything with this stuff on or mixed into it. Cannot recommend.,1
"My hound gets 1 of these a year, and it takes him a year to gnaw it done!",5
"Switched over to this food as something different other than Blue Buffalo and Wellness.  Both of my dogs started turning up their noses to the previous foods, so it was time for a change.  Not only do they enjoy this food, they beg for it at feeding time and scarf it down.  Very pleased with this product and it's price!  Will continue to order this product.",5
"Dont waste your money. Buy a Hydor, they aren't much more.",1
"My dogs played for hours, but soon torn this toy apart. I got small and large. Both toys got ripped, but still functional. I have a hound mix and a terrier mix, so two different size. My terrier mis more gentle with toys. However, the hound quickly figured out how to chew through the toy.",3
"I would probably give this product 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive. It is exactly like other items on the market (most noticeably the Nite Ize SpotLit) that are available for much less.

That being said this product is still pretty pawsum. It is a great safety device while walking your pup at night or dusk/dawn when there is low lighting. It is also great for those who live in the country and can simply let their dogs out the back door to do their business. With the light on their collar you can see them no matter where they roam in the dark. Use different colors on different dogs to tell them apart in the dark.

The four settings are unique to this product and that is kind of nice to have the choices of steady ON, FAST blink or SLOW blink. Fourth setting is off. It is easy to slip onto the D ring of a dog's collar and not so easy to take off (actually this is a good thing, you don't want it falling off). It is designed to lay flat against a dog's chest for best visibility.

I was given this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.",4
It's my cats favorite,5
"It's turkey, not caviar! $30 plus fur a case?!?!  I can even understand that if it's at least duck or rabbit, but turkey?!  I managed to catch it fur $25 a case and ordered four only to have the order suddenly canceled at that price!!! Never happened before on amazon...can't believe it happened this time.  Merrick's a great product but the prices are getting out of control.

5 stars for the product but knocked to three because of the absurd pricing and failure to stand by the lower price a found on amazon a few weeks ago.",3
My dog loves this but recently he has started throwing up the rawhide that comes with it.  I now worry that these rawhide chews are contaminated since they are made in a country that has produced tainted pet foods in the past.,2
This stuff works great. Anyone with issues that this is needed should be well satisfied.,5
"It is a real memory foam bed for dogs, the pooches love them. It is a very nice dog bed.",5
Disappointed in the sizing. I can't figure out how to adjust. It says there are two adjustment points but I can only find one. I'm donating to a rescue Group,2
"Well there is good and bad about this ChuckIt toy. We've used the ChuckIt ball thrower for years for our tennis ball obsessed standard poodle. So much so that her teeth have what our vet calls, ""Tennis ball teeth,"" because of a certain wearing down of her canines.

So, I was excited to try something new for her. I got her excited about it, launched it, and she couldn't see it. Mine is green. It blends right in. And even if dogs are color blind, it doesn't have enough scent on it yet for her to be able to sniff it out. So I went and got it and tried again. Eventually, she peeled after it but instead of bringing it back like she does with balls, she chewed on it. Maybe she wanted to get her scent on it so it would be easier to find. Ha ha.

After trying for awhile, I finally got her to bring it halfway back but she was often distracted. I know any new toy needs some training - for both of us - but I'm not sold on this. While she got excited when she saw me pulling it back she wasn't very good at getting it back to me. It must have been something about how it felt in her mouth. She often looked like she was smoking a cigar with it hanging out.

Having said that, it travels about half the distance of a ChuckIt with a ball. It's fun to launch it. But if you misfire, it can smack you back hard. For me, the jury is still out.",4
Bought these steps for my 10 year old dog who was having trouble jumping into the back of my car and up onto the couch.  It is light enough for me to easily carry around but still very sturdy and stable.  The carpet on the steps helps to avoid slipping.,5
"This is a perfect pump -- works like a champ. Clean it every month, and it will run for a long long time. But if you let it get gunked up with algae, you'll be replacing it after a year. I know, I let my first one get gunky. Follow the directions with the packaging on cleaning it -- really easy, and takes about 5 minutes of your time.",5
"It matches the patio tile which is a plus. It was also quite cheap! The dog and the cat fight about who gets to lounge on it. The cat usually wins and it is its preferred sleeping spot, now. He will choose to stay outside on this bed instead of coming inside.",5
This is like giving chocolate to a baby! The snails grabbed the little tab like making sure nobody is gonna take it away from them and hugged them falling on their backs!!!! Seems like I did a great buy and definitely a great product!,5
"I purchased these collars because the add says that this is for 2 small dogs as i have a min-pin and rat terrier mix both 10 lbs each soaking wet... however when the item was shipped they are for large dogs like labs pitbulls etc.. this description does not  match what you actually receive AT ALL,,,",1
"We love it, our dog loves it. It works great. We just have to remember to clear the bowl of dirt on a daily basis, but it's nice to know our dog will have fresh water no matter how hot it gets outside.",5
Works as advertised,5
"With the leash clipped on the front, it throws puppy off balance enough that she stops pulling quite as badly.  At a full charge, the harness flips her completely upside down.  She only did that twice and then stopped charging to the end of the long lead. Voila! Now that she leads well, we turned it around backward and clip the clip above her shoulders.  It's easy to get on and off and seems much more comfortable than a lead clipped to her collar.",5
Works great in the rat cage! They love it!,5
"Great deal this huge box for what a cereal size box would cost at a store, and my dog loves them, she is little and they are the only ones that I don't have to break in half.",5
Works well and easy to clean with a brush.,5
this is a nice scoop.  strong and good grip. don't get the $5 one and be disappointed when it bends or breaks over time,5
This Mink Oil is very creamy. The oil applies easily to my leather boots and gives them protection from the elements. Very nice product at a good price.,5
Excellent product. Perfect for traveling. Good size for feeding and watering my cat.,5
this is a long term solution for dogs teeth  so don't know if it works or not but should  easy to use,5
"Plant has an odd combination of colors & definitely looks fake. Some of the leaves are purple & white, others are blue & white.",3
"One of my kitties developed acute bacterial cholangiohepatitis, which we caught early, and still needed a month of antibiotics. His movements became loose, as they typically do on antibiotics, then I realized, I take probiotics when I'm on them, why not give some to him?

Google led me to this product. It was just what he needed! He also loves the taste, which helped, because his appetite wasn't all that great (he barely made it out of the hospital without a feeding tube).

While I was giving him the probiotics, I decided to give it to one of the others, who has allergies. His eye winkies cleared up quite a bit!

This worked very well for my boys. I now give them a little kefir with their food, but will not hesitate to purchase this again if necessary.",5
"This is probably the 20th puppia harness I've purchased over the last 12 years.... not because they wear out, only because I wanted different colors!",5
"I heard this was great to keep doggies' teeth tarter free, but my dogs hate it.  They act like it's the worse thing I've ever put in their mouths.  :(",2
I was very happy with the bags and the price was right and very fast delivery!,5
My husky and yorkie love this food !!  They are hard to please. You have no idea how many bags of food we have thrown out !  The shelters won't take opened bags. Terrible waste of money. I think it's expensive. Dont know if we will continue.  It's twice the price we normally buy.,5
"This is the third harness I have purchased for my little dog and is by far the best fitting.  She is a chihuahua-pug mix and has a small head & neck with a larger body, and finding a harness to fit her has been difficult - this one fits her well.",5
My dogs likes chewing on these. I like the Nylabones....,4
My Chihuahua wouldn't eat it but she doesn't like any dry dogfood.,2
Very roomy and plenty of room for two baggies of puppy food and treats in the top.,4
"I received a small plant that looked like it was flattening and drying out like an old leaf.  the root system was pretty lousy too and the leaves were bunched/pinched together.  for a long time, i wondered if it would even make it.  i contacted Aquarium Plants and Pets (the seller) and asked them about my concerns but they never contacted me back. i just wanted reassurance that my little water plant would eventually get better or if i should get another one and hope for the best.  either way, after spring threw us a very warm night, this plant seemed to have came alive and it opened up like in the picture and the roots started to grow and it went from getting a light color to getting a more lush green color and better yet, after a few more warm nights, it started to produce a baby plant.  i'm very happy with my little plant, not so happy with customer service that could have gave me something instead of completely ignoring me.",4
Fun toy but when you have an avid chewer even this material gets chewed through ...unfortunately he was having fun with it until he decided to attack it,2
my doggie loves it,5
This is one of the best can cat foods out there. My cats all love it. It has improved their overall health plus they now have healthy shinny fur. I would strongly recommend this product. Earthborn Holistic cat food is the only can food I will feed my cats.,5
Worthless unless you enjoy barking followed by high pitched beeps... It is going back!,1
My dog has eaten the last two bark collars. So far this one has stood up to the test of time. I like the adjustability of all of the settings. Rechargeable batteries is a plus too since buying the other ones and waiting for them to arrive is a pain in the butt.,4
So luxurius.  Our cat actually sleeps in this on her own.,4
"This Kitty Harness product is an inexpensive way to try to walk your cat. Although the concept is great and the product itself is fine for the price, I have two issues which I think are important for potential buyers.

First, make sure to get the right size. If your cat's girth isn't representative of its build, then the harness won't fit right, leading to a higher likelihood the cat will escape. For cats in between two sizes or who have a stockier build (e.g., a Korat or similar breed), I would definitely recommend choosing the smaller size. If possible, also try the leash on at a store. This will help you evaluate the fit and get a sense of whether your cat is at all receptive to wearing the harness (not all cats will be).

Second, the bungee leash portion of the product isn't ideal. The leash only extends an extra foot or two, but if you're near a busy road or an area with high pedestrian traffic, the leash can be troublesome because it doesn't pull tight right away. If something raises your cat's curiosity while you're walking near a road, the flexibility of the leash makes it take an extra second or two to pull your cat back. Unlike some dog leashes, where you can adjust and set the length of the leash, this leash was clearly designed to be a little more forgiving to the cat. Something to keep in mind depending on where you plan on walking your cat.",4
These work very well. I have Shih Tzus and the tearing they have from their eyes can smell pretty bad sometimes and this wipe works great. I only have to use it every five to six days when their eyes are watery.,5
"This is smaller than the original brush I use on my cavalier. This is actually better in the sense that the comb is a bit finer and really gets in there to brush fine fur on a long haired dog. I'll have to wait and see how long it lasts, because I brush my dog every day!",4
"I have been giving this dog food to my beagle jack russell mix dog (now 3 years old) for a couple of years now except it was just rice not whole brown rice. My dog used to have diarrhea and it stopped ever since I started feeding him this. His stool also became solid which made clean up very easy. I also noticed his coat improving and actually had some compliments on how shiny his fur is. I have been buying this since then. The new whole brown rice version is what I'm feeding him and my other dog (1 year old Italian greyhound) right now and I am just as satisfied with the results. It is more expensive than the other brands but definitely worth the money. It's definitely cheaper than having to go the vet constantly due to diarrhea caused by cheap dog food.
Oh and you can use the box it came with as a dog bed just put some blankets and pillows in it!

Note: This is the same review I made on Wag.com which is the website you will be directed to by Amazon. Very fast shipping too for a bulky package.",5
"The food is great.  T didn't taste it of course, just going by my GS.  The only thing they need to do differently is offer this brand in weight management, and without chicken.  Use turkey b/c he has gained a little weight.  He only gets 2 cups of dry a day and 1/2 can daily. We make 2 meals out of total",5
"This ball has been floating in my turtle tank for about three weeks. ""Is there a noticeable difference to the clarity of water and its smell?"" No. I bought it to reduce odor, but I'm not sure if it's making a difference because there is still a faint odor from the water. I have two filters on my tank to combat odor and I constantly scoop debris. If I could find a product that could keep down ANY odor emanating from the tank, I would be satisfied. I won't purchase this product again.",1
My dog loves these balls.  Just like a little kid he loves the squeaky noise.  These are a little smaller then my last order but still worth it.,5
Well it is hard to say just before I got them my Beta got sick & quit eating period & passed.  Haven't decided whether or not to replace him.,5
"I have a smaller mat like this that I use under the water bucket for the dogs.  It does a good job of keeping the wood floor under it dry  and clean.  This one is exactly the right size for under our guinea pigs cage.  I have it sticking out about four inches to catch the water and the hay.  There seems to be tons of hay involved with a guinea pig.  Where do they put it?  Its like a party in there.

Anyway, this mat catches the extra hay and makes it easier to clean up!",4
Returned,1
If you have a male dog that is having issues these are very easy to put on and extremely absorbent.  Tried that reusable ones but they were bulky and uncomfortable for our old boy. He didn't have issues with these.,5
my dogs go crazy over these,5
"We got this collar for our mini-Aussie after she got spayed and cannot say enough good things about it!! It has been the absolute best thing ever for her post-surgery recovery, making it so much smoother and easier. She can't lick the stitches, we can pet her, and she can eat and drink without difficulty. Prior to using this, we had a traditional cone which was cumbersome and she had a difficult time doing general stuff, she'd bonk into the walls, and spill food and water everywhere. Needless to say, this is absolutely worth the purchase-- get it before your pup goes into surgery and keep it on deck so you're ready to rock. Comfort means the world in these situations (not to mention it's quieter when she's roaming around)!",5
kitty loves this,5
Easy for the dogs to catch and carry.,4
My dogs (a Cavalier & a Border Collie) had been on a premium pet store dog food which they wouldn't eat unless I added a dollop of canned food and which continued to give one of them diarrhea from time to time.  I picked up a bag of Newman's Organic Advanced and offered them a little handful as soon as I got home.  They both loved it and started wiggling and tail wagging for more!  This morning I gave them a full share with nothing else on it and both dived right in.  I know a lot of pet food reviewers poo poo grains but experience has taught me that the super high protein/low grain dog foods are not palatable and tend to be too rich for my dogs.  I think Newman's strikes a good balance.,5
"Bought this for our lion head bunny, who immediately proceeded to get the stuff clumped into her fur.  Unusable.",2
The squeaker toy is a great value for pele that have dogs that love those toys.  It is well made and has several squeaker points.  Our dog loves it.,5
"*My rating is based solely on the color not the quality of the collar itself.

As a previous buyer of this product (but in different colors) I would say the quality of these collars is great.

Another purchaser stated the sellers pic makes the it look a little iridescent, and I agree but it is not, it's merely shiny because of the nylon material.

I purchased a Hamilton double thick nylon deluxe collar (blue) Dec of 2012 and another (in purple) May of 2013 for my two GSD's. Technically the old collars are still in great condition and work fine despite each collar somehow managing to lose one grommet a piece. Even with the grommets gone the collars work fine but I decided to buy some new ones anyway and use the old ones as backups. Within the last week I bought this exact collar in Navy/22in and a second one in Lavender/22in. The navy one is great, the color is just as expected. The lavender however, is more of a dinghy gray-purple color in person. I was hoping for something that was a little brighter and with less gray tones. I did not exchange this item because the cost of shipping wasn't worth the effort.",2
I didn't use them long because it didn't work in the turtle tank like I thought it would. I thought they would be a little better. I would recommend them for a fish tank.,3
"My dogs LOVE this toy and it is holding up well.  They are Golden Retrievers, so they are pretty rough with it.",5
"Great quality, looks more comfortable than the previous harness and I love the spring loaded handle. I use this for my 60lb Amstaff and I have full control of him, thanks YOGADOG.",5
Made n USA and the dogs love these.  Easy treat to give as 5 little erasure sized are enough for one treat.,5
High for the amount you get....you can get leca clay balls for way cheaper and a giant bag and the do the same thing.,3
"My cats are big cable chewers and this stuff stopped the destruction. It's clear, so it doesn't look too awful, but honestly I'd use it if it was bright orange because it works so well.",5
Very easy to use and feel a lot better using a tested and proven restraint when underway with my dear puppy!,5
"My cat is not allowed outside unless she is on her harness, but at times, I like to take her out with me when I have things I need to do outside. I can put her in this and not worry about her walking off.",4
I get these for my bird because he loves to chew them up as fast as he can.  These at least give him a little trouble unlike some of the other kinds.  He is a small Senegal Parrot so they fit in his mouth.,5
cat loves it,5
Just perfect!!!!  Just what I was looking for and my Boys are thrilled with their new mat!,5
"Pretty sturdy, but I still don't let my dog play with it unsupervised. She tends to rip toys like this apart because the hole gives her a good starting point.",5
"We have a 7lb male Chihuahua that we rescued from the animal shelter. He unfortunately had very bad marking habits and was soon eyeing every corner and leg of our furniture. This belly band saved our relationship with him.  It fits really well with a thin maxi pad attached to it and stays on all day while we are at work. He doesn't seem to mind it too much, but the maxi pad is usually pretty full when we get home. Unfortunately, he does have some pee stains on his belly fur, but we wipe him down every night and will probably start shaving his belly a little.

I think this band is great for people who love their pets but don't have any other alternatives to keep them from marking.",5
"great product and holds up amazing. only complaint is that when i tied my dog up outside for a moment, he managed to slip out of it",4
"Great, no-smell litter.  I hate the perfumed smell of most litters, but this just smells like actual pine. No urine smell, either. The only downside is heavy tracking after the pellets turn into pine dust.",4
"I bought this in conjunction with a Kitty Holster cat harness. I like to bring our cat out to sit with us on the balcony, and the 4' length looked perfect for how much slack with which I'd feel comfortable. The chain is fairly heavy and well built. This is actually the second one I've purchased after having this my first Hamilton chain for about a year, purchasing it for our first cat. When it came time to get a second chain for the new pet, this was an easy choice. The handle thing is reasonably comfortable, and the chain has never locked up nor exhibited signs of wear. The links are strong enough to prevent the cats from busting free and leaping to their doom, which is exactly what you want in a chain like this.",5
This was not my cats favorite food. He prefers junk (like meow mix) but he eventually ate it begrudgingly because he's a very hungry cat. He hasn't lost any weight and regurgitates his food often so I'm not sticking with this brand.,4
"Rocky, our box turtle goes scrambling for these when they show up in his feeding dish.",5
"Coastal, as always makes quality collars.",5
We were using a dewormer on our new puppy and it wasn't working. Once I was able to get a sample of the worm my veterinarian identified it as being a tapeworm. We bought this product and it was incredible how fast it worked!,5
Thought I had already reviewed this.  This was bought for the MidWest cat playpen and it fits perfectly.,5
"Used it as a pre-filter to my hang on back aquarium filter. If you need heavy mechanical filtration, it will clog easily.",5
good stuff,4
Dog loves it.,5
"Very good product, will definitely buy again!",5
"These look sharp on our pups! Plus, they are easy to put on and they are comfy as well. We have a couple of them so that we can change them when they get dirty. They wash well, too!",5
No. This thing sucks. It barely clamps onto anything you're grabbing and for me it's dog poop. It squished the poop instead of scooping it. I used it for maybe 3 minutes and then tossed it. What a waste!,1
A Must have to keep litter from tracking on your floors.,5
My Kitties go craycray for this!,5
"Let's get something clear first, no air pump runs 100% quiet, no matter what the manufacturer says. Now the review :

After all the numerous mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance and get this air pump anyway, and I'm glad I did.
This pump, as the title says, is surprisingly quiet, the sound of the bubbles and the waves in my tank are actually louder than this pump, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. I have an old, square shape, Aquaculture pump that was bugging me it was so loud. The Tetra Whisper pump emits a very,  almost unnoticed hum. The pump has 2 outakes and comes included with the following:
The pump of course, instructions , 1T-adapter; 2 knobs/valves that  help regulate the amount of bubbles you feed into the aquarium by increasing/decreasing air flow. This is actually perfect for those like me with a smaller tank,  even though I have a 50 GAL, I don't have to have bubbles at full blast.
I had a problem with my wave maker stirring bubbles all over the place, but now with this new pump, I can have less bubbles in the area near the powerheads hooked  to my wave maker. I'm currently using this pump with these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elite-1-Inch-Cylinder-Air-Stone-4-Pack/dp/B0002AQHC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elite 1-Inch Cylinder Air Stone, 4-Pack</a>&nbsp;and so far, so good. Let the stones soak in your tank for at least 10 minutes before using them.

Some people recomend keeping the pump above water level, but in my 12 years of keeping aquariums I've never done that; just make sure you create a ""drip loop"" for the power cord with a screw or a push pin, so if water for some reason finds its way down, it will hang and drip at the loop and not reach the AC plug. You may also want to get these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2-PCS-Non-return-Check-Valves-for-Aquarium-Air-Pump/dp/B005HTT1P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2 PCS Non-return Check Valves for Aquarium Air Pump</a>&nbsp;to keep water from going into the pump during water changes or power outages.

If you ask me if I have any complaints about this pump,  I'd say its size, but that's a minor issue for me, the dome shape of the pump was intentionally designed to reduce the amount of noise it makes, and it works.
The pump measurements are as follow:
7.5 inches long, 4.5 inches wide and 3 inches high.

Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase, the pump is well built, high quality and made to last. The best feature of course, its almost silent operation, I don't have to crank the volume up on my TV anymore.

One last tip, if you want this pump, or any other pump to make less noise, place it on top of a thick sock or an old fashioned mouse pad. That should absorb some of the vibrations.",5
Love them!,5
Sturdy toy for my 3 rough and tumble dogs.  Item was much smaller than I anticipated/thought but has held up very well to being thrown and played with a great deal.,3
Excellent!,5
Not very thick. My dogs prefer the larger size.,4
dogs love this,5
"I gave the Orthopedic 100% Memory Foam Pet Bed a 5 star rating because my large 7-year-old hound dog loves it.  The price is very reasonable, so at first I hesitated to buy it, thinking it might be poor quality. I'm very satisfied with the purchase, however,  and will buy one for our beagle also when he needs it.",5
Love this brand of leashes and collars.  Really nice quality.  This pattern is so cool and vibrant for my girly dog.,5
My parakeet loves it..,5
this smaller size is good,4
My cats can't get enough of it. I do which it was a little heavier. It's so light that I had to tape it down so my cats aren't pushing it throughout the house as they use it.,4
Not really great for plants like it says it is. good light for fake plants.,3
Works well.  Used them on my Persian cat with a lot of hair.  He looks so cute in his lion cut!,5
There were only 2 kinds of treats in this bucket. I got the sausages and tendons. My dog loves the sausages but not the tendons. This was supposed to have 4 kinds of treats in it.,2
"Great balls, but too big for my 6 lbs Chi",5
"I am very impressed with this air pump. I was a little skeptical because of the price but it turned out to be a phenomal piece. Air stones, tubes, and pumps are all included. Makes fascinating streams of bubbles in my tank, very powerful. The noise is not bad at all but still present, however I find it peaceful. My perch, Humphrey, is very fond of them because it mimics the environment of his creek home of which I abducted him from. Exceptional air pump!",5
I bought this for my 7.5 lb. Yorkie/ chinese crested mix. I bought a size large. Fits great!!,5
Dog plays with this several times a day. Each time he feels like he has just discovered a brand new toy and a new way of entertaining himself and defending the home front!,5
Dogs enjoy them,4
"These are a healthier alternative to rawhide bones, but they lasted less than a minute. They are more of an edible treat than a chew. All 3 of our small/medium sized dogs loved the taste, but they are much too big as a snack. I gave 4 stars because our dogs really did love them and they are so much healthier than other snacks. I would recommend getting a size that would be snack-size for your dog, not chew-size like you would with a bone.",4
Fresh and my bunny loves the pellets. Thank you,5
Great dog food and my dogs loved it for about two weeks. Now they aren't eating like there were. I probably will try a different flavor next time.,5
"I foster and adopt rescues.  I have used the ""prong collar"" for some of my problem ""children"" with nominal results.  I opted for the harness and for some reason saw a dramatic improvement in walking the dogs.  Of course, keeping in mind that appropriate training of the human and dog, remaining consistent (and calm and assertive)are the key factors.",5
"My male love bird a baby likes these alot,its not a full meal for your bird,fruit and veges and a mixed seed and pellet diet is what i give. GOOD HEALTHY ADD TO REAL FOOD treat,i give like 3 a day plus birds real foods parakeet size is best for my love bird",5
I though was a biggest size perpect for my 55 gal. tank.,1
"This is a high quality dog toy, but but the dogs just don't seem to have much interest in it for some reason.",3
My cat was keeping her eye closed for over a day. I bought this and gave her 2 drops. Within 30 minutes she was back to normal. Amazing!!,5
Perfect for the leash.,5
"Set up and clean up are incredibly easy with this backseat seat cover. I connect the top part to the head rests of my back seat, let my shepherd/akita mix jump in, secure him, and sometimes connect the other end to the head rests of the front seats. If you connect both ends you're going to minimize the amount of hair that you get in your car vs. just securing the backs. When we get out, I pop off the seat cover and give it a good shake or two. I've also spilled salsa on this cover by accident and after fearing the worst, there was nary a stain. I wiped it down and it was as good as new. I volunteer at a rescue and can confirm that the padding is comfortable for dogs of all sizes given the number of them that have fallen asleep in my back seat.",5
"Seriously a great buy, I am so happy. The material is very thick and durable. Even the bottom of the bed is not that flimsy paper cloth material like a lot of other pet beds. It is nice an squishy and just seems like something my bulldog will enjoy.",5
This nifty outfit has really helped with my 5 month old kitten recover from her spay surgery. She's super active so it allows her to still get around without restrictions like an e Collar does. It took her fully coming off of anesthesia to get use to the outfit. I bought her an xxxs and it fits well. My cat is 4.5 lbs. Her vet thinks its a great alternative to an e collar and was more than willing to put it on her before waking up after surgery. I was worried about the back end becoming soiled during litter box visits but it still clean. The back end is open wide enough that it won't get soiled. My baby looks so cute in it.,5
these can be hard to put on and off but they fit well and stay on if correctly sized,5
Does  not eliminate odors. It just masks them temporarily. I have gone through several bottles of this stuff and it just does not do the trick.,2
"I bought this intending to use it primarily for between my dog's toes. However, after doing this one time, it seemed to have irritated my dog's toes, possibly skimming her skin. So I now just use it for under her eyes and around her ear canal (because I have a cocker spaniel and she gets ear infections like crazy so shaving the hair helps). Overall, it's great but I wouldn't recommend it for in between the toes simply because you have to press the trimmer in the nook of the toes and can't really control it. Does wonderful for my dog's ear and under eyes.",4
My bettas love this!  I have 13 different tank setups and they are all happy and lively when this product is put in their water.  It doesn't stain if you use the smaller recommended amount and the difference in water color is barely noticible.,5
Great item for the money.  Works as advertised.  I would recommend this item.,5
Great for all outside wildlife. Birds love these things. Squirrels...well...they will climb and just about knock on the door.,5
It works great and keeps the fine hair from flying around and aggravating our allergies.,5
My puppy is less than a pound - these are a bit big for her - but she will grow into them I am sure!,5
"Like the smaller chews in the light blue package, these larger chews in the light yellow bag remind me of the Digesteaze bones, the bones that break apart faster when the dog's saliva gets these saturated.  These contain only rawhide and natural chicken liver flavoring.  The guaranteed analysis includes a min of 78% crude protein, 0.05% min on crude fat, 2% max crude fiber and 14% max moisture.  These are lightweight.  One of my dogs likes to play fetch with one of these for a bit before sitting down to chew on it.

Made in Vietnam.",5
"This is the perfect size for my hatchling red eared slider. It provides just enough heat and it doesn't cook him. It is easy to use you just put the sticky side on the tank and plug it in. It is light weight and causes no problems with your tank. I am thankful for my discount and very happy with this purchase.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aiicioo-8-Watt-Reptile-Heating-Pad-6x8-Inch-Under-Tank-Heater-Waterproof-Fish-Tank-Heat-Pad-UL-Approval-Small/dp/B018VQ71JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aiicioo 8 Watt Reptile Heating Pad 6x8 Inch Under Tank Heater Waterproof Fish Tank Heat Pad UL Approval-Small</a>",5

I have heard great things about this product from everyone I know that uses it. I just got it in the mail today and placed it in the aquarium. I will update my review later if needed but I have high hopes for it!,5
"Rather than repeating myself here, please click on my name ""Shiningtree"" to read my review on the Breeze litter system. Thank you.",5
Great bulb.,5
"Both of my dogs go nuts for these treats! They don't have a weird smell (like some treats do), they are grain free, and you get a good amount for the price. I originally bought them for our puppy because he was so tiny when we got him, and I wanted a treat that was soft enough that I could break it in half before giving it to him. Now both of my dogs come running when they see/smell me open a bag of these.",5
"Great stuff and a little sprinkle makes my cat chow down! BUT the price keeps going up and I have to change sources all the time. Just when I find a good one, they jack their prices. Guess they hope people aren't paying attention. Shouldn't cost over $20!",4
Our fur babies loved them.,5
Love Nylabone,4
AAA+++,5
Good for a one time use,3
This is the best litter box system ever invented! I have 2 cats and no urine smell after 4 days. Very easy to clean also!!,5
the powder seemed to go away quickly. Not sure if it calmed the cats down or not - maybe one but not the other,3
This stuff has worked great. Works best just as directed and the area is a bit damp. I will be buying more as needed.,5
"With regular use, most of my dogs' teeth show improvement, less tartar.",5
Awesome design Ruffwear Inc. came out with. Very durable and the clip won't ever break.,5
"Great addition to the NB  line and my cats love it. Will update later to see how it works with Ms. AllergyPants.

UPDATE 7/8/14
THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS EGG! This is one of the only ones in their wet food line up that contains egg. My cat is allergic to eggs and something else in this flavor. Manufacturer said it may be something in the undisclosed ""natural flavor."" She has wheat/corn/egg/many allergies, so we are careful in what we give her. PLEASE be careful and compare the ingredients of this flavor with the other NB food. We have no problems with the LID and Ultra formulas.
Amazon offered a full refund for it even though we had gone through a few cans before noticing the allergy.",3
This has served as home for many hamsters over the years. I love that its plastic and easy to clean. The pieces come apart easily and overall the whole thing is pretty sturdy. I haven't had an escapee yet! Only drawback is the water bottle leaks pretty bad.,5
"Our dog didn't really like these, when she likes almost any chew toy.",3
"I love this fountain.  So do the cats; it is their prefered fountain.  I have another make/model upstairs, but they prefer to drink from this one.  I think it is the stream that flows over the side -- they lap from that.  My other fountain does not do that.
This fountain also looks nice and stays cleaner longer.  I wash it each week, but it has not grown any slime like the plastic ones do.  I have put it in the dishwasher, but now just wash by hand since washing by hand is faster and it does not have breed slime. My only concern with it is that it is a bit heavy and awkward when picking it up and moving it and since it is ceramic I worry I may break it.  That would be sad as I would have to pay for another.",5
Easy spot seems to work - don't see any fleas or ticks on the cats. I got it first from my vet but since then have ordered through Amazon - it's cheaper here.,4
"I love it perfect size I needed,  only thing is it does the grip is hard plastic ... rubber grip would be nice. But for the price I wound complain",4
This product is imposible to get on my pug.  We are having it altered to give it adjustable chest and stomach area.  Product is really cute.,2
My red ear sliders devour these treats!  Funky smell though.,5
"These far exceeded my expectations. They are awesome for keeping just about anything. I have used them for beverages ( no leaking) and I have also used them for storage of dried goods in my pantry (cheezits, trail mix, M&M's). Nice display and you can see what irks in there crystal clear!! I am ordering more!!!!",5
"Nice very nice.  Feels like  they are for a professional use.  Cut nice and clean.
Thanks",5
My bunny loves this food!,4
"Love this product, especially when it's under $10",5
"Love the product, but unfortunately I had bought it to take to work to have my blind sick dog with me at work. We had to put her to sleep a few days after I ordered. There was absolutely no problem returning the pen. Should I add another furbaby to my family we would surely order again. Thank you!",5
Good product. Goes on easy. I love the double sided soft bristled brush. I'm a groomer and brush my dog's teeth daily. I recommend this product. Gets the job done and quickly.,5
"Very cute however the sizing is a little weird, I bought a large because some of the reviews said that it ran a little small but it was way too big- then I bought a medium and it was too tight on my dog, he wears a medium but I feel like it's crushing his little tummy a bit. Otherwise it would be a great item because it does Velcro on so it's easy while their wiggling around trying to get them dressed.",5
"really love it!!! and so do my cats!!!!  had a plastic one before and hated all the slime buildup, this ceramic is great.  Also, so so very easy to clean.  I like that it is so heavy, i've got some big cats, and some like to paw at the base before they drink, and could move the plastic one, so they can't move this one. Very happy with my choice, and debating on even getting a second one for another room.  I have several cats, and all ages and all sizes are really using and liking it.  really happy with it.",5
"My golden retriever absolutely loves this ball. We play at night and he is always so exited. Super recommended. One thing... Even doe is hard, try not to bounce them in the trees or any hard surface, it may fall apart and at night it's very difficult to find the places to put it back together.",5
"can't say enough about Gentle Leader brand! We've tried others. They aren't the same! STick with Gentle Leader! I was NOT paid to say this. We have great danes and even with proper training, a dog can pull sometimes. You have to be prepared. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the NEW padded nose loop. We bought this one just to replace a perfectly good one that didn't have the padding. that's how awesome it is.",5
"I own three dogs that we take on tons of road trips and have vaguely wanted to secure them but never did much about it. After a safety course a few years ago where local police demonstrated how a 30 lb baby or pet easily is ripped from your arms and ends up on roadways after going through windshields in accidents, we looked into car safety straps.

We have had the more common harness-types that loop onto seat-belts (we use our own harnesses, however) and while they work beautifully, they are about $20 each and are a little time consuming when it comes to switching them between our cars.

On a whim, I bought one of these to see if it would lock securely into my car. It did, and is such a less bulky option that easily moves from seat to seat (no need for the belts to be buckled!), we immediately ordered enough for all three dogs in both cars. For the price, I really expected it to fall apart the minute I opened it, but it's been fantastic thus far!",5
"I love this dog food, but prefer the chicken to the beef. The dogs do great on it and as one of my dogs is a diabetic, her check ups come back super.
Do buy it for your sake but most importantly for you precious dog's sake!",5
"I have a small dog and she is getting on in years.  I decided that it would be safer for her to use the steps instead of jumping off the bed.  She wanted to part of the steps.  When I tried to get her to use them, they were wobbly and she was scared.  She only weighs 12 lbs. and she is well within the weight limit.  I gave them to a friend and her dog wouldn't use them either.  The plastic makes them look cheap and flimsy.",2
My dogs loved these. They are a good big size and lasted a good amount of time. Their stomachs seemed to like these a lot better than the more typical rawhide so I was happy and they were happy. A win!,5
"Great food, doesn't sink immediately so the top feeders can get there fill but does sink eventually so the bottom feeders can clean up.",5
great product! dog loves it,5
"I'd highly recommend the lime green one!  It's bright, and super cute.  It's a nice sturdy leash, with a nice metal clip.  I love that it's rechargeable.  I've had other light up dog accessories, that were a one time shot, and were basically trash after the battery ran out in them.  Walking at night is now safe, and a little bit more fun.  Everyone can see us coming.

I was given this product for free, and was happy to write a review.  I'm super happy with the product an absolutely think it's worthy of 5 stars.",5
"Squeaker only lasted about a day but she hasn't opened it up after several rough and tumble play sessions, despite her best efforts. She still enjoys tossing it around and chomping on it even though it's squeakless. She's a strong chewer and relentless on her toys so overall I'd say this one is a winner all around.",4
"Used the size graph provided & measured my dog, ordered the Medium for my Cocker Spaniel. It did not fit at all. It was way too small.",3
"I tried several types of food before my betta FINALLY ate this. I brought him home and he refused to eat for a good week, so I tried several kinds (even the brand that the store fed him) but it looks like this brand did the trick. I suspect that it's because its laced with garlic, so I'm glad it works!",5
"So, I take my dog to work. I keep these clipped to my dog ""baby bag"" with a large clip.

Unfortunately, my dog thinks that the bowl is as tasty as his food. These are quite easily distructed.  I keep two in reserve so that I may use them for water and food in my office. At present, do not leave them down; your dog may find them a toy. I would love to have a version that is not so easily eaten.",3
Five of six small dogs at my house will eat these if offered no other treats.,4
my puppy likes it. its not too big and not too small for my toy poodle puppy.,5
The squeaker in this ball lasted 20 minutes!!!  An expensive toy!,3
VERY POOR QUALITY. This thing is a waste of money. I returned it the day I got it. Don't waste  your time.,1
This is the second i purchased. First went to my husband. This one is for my tank. Very quiet in the living room.,5
"Dogs love them, they last for a reasonable duration
Only time will tell if their teeth are actually cleaner with out them",4
"This product is great, my dog love it.  Her coat is smooth and shiny and her digestion is good she never has gas.  Overall i'm happy",5
"Doggie got good news at his dental appointment this year, he's seven years old and still has pearly whites with no decay!  I can't believe he loves something so good for him. I caught him trying to break into the box the other day... luckily it was a very strong box.
These aren't cheap but a poor dental checkup would mean FAR more expense so I'm delighted to provide one a day for my sweet boy.",5
Thanks,5
cats to picky.,3
"Our very smart terrior has figured out how to open the rear windows in our Ram pickup. So, we are very pleased with this door protector by K&H which has so far deterred him from opening the windows.  Also love the travel bag for his leash, harness and rabies certificate. (I keep his treats with me or he would simply help himself )",5
Worked good,5
"My cat took on the challenge issued by the high shield and proceeded to make use of it. Unfortunately, the urine ended up just dribbling outside the box through the seams, which doubled the clean up time.",2
cat responds well to this,5
"Coupled  with my new aerator pump, this air stone puts out a tremendous amount of oxygen into my fish tank.  I highly recommend this air stone",5
"My cat and my puppies all love this tunnel. They get endless amounts of fun playing tag, pushing it around, and chewing on it. It is durable and  squishes up nicely for put-away time. The biggest draw-back to this is that it has some kinds krinkly material so it is noisy when all 3 of my babies get rowdy in it.",5
Great for small to medium sized cats.easy to put together.,5
Works good,5
Truly this is the best product to collect cat urine.  No mess or fuss.  The cat doesn't mine either.  He thinks it is just litter.,5
"My kitten ABSOLUTELY LOVES this canned chicken and gravy food!

He's very finicky and turns away from most food except this one, with the exception to my cooking.

I think maybe the salmon canned  food might be too dry, and the turkey canned food is maybe too greasy?  So if I want him to eat the Hill's salmon or turkey, I must mince/cube cheese into the leftover canned food.

He will not eat any other types of canned food leftovers after they're placed into the refrigerator except this Chicken and gravy mixture.  (It must have MSG in it or something! ;-)",5
The best cat toy and affordable enough to have one hanging out of every drawer in the house,5
Cats really loved this Kitty Pad. For next winter will get a couple more. Much nicer than the (2) old ones I had for the cats. Would recommend !!,5
This item was great until I washed it.  It shredded in the washer and not useable after that.  Not sure if was the material or the stitching that didn't hold.,3
Both of our dogs love this food and have 0 digestive issues with it. Our pug has weight issues and it's easy to keep her ideal weight in check with proper proportions of this food.,5
This is really nice. I just wish my cats would use it. I've had it for 2 months and so far they've ignored it. They love to sleep in boxes and under blankets tented over the furniture so I haven't given up hope. The size is good but I think it would be a tight squeeze for a larger cat weighing more than 9 pounds or so.,5
"Smaller than I pictured, but my dog loves it!",4
My dog loves these! Great little treat to give - my dog loves the flavor.,5
My 2 dogs love it!,5
"Very sturdy crate, doors are easy to open.  Only complaint is that the ramps come off a little too easily.  Otherwise a great buy.",4
"I mix the recommended amount in my dogs food and have been doing so for a couple of years.  I keep it refrigerated.  Although its tough to tell exactly what benefits it brings to my dog in conjunction with a high quality dog food, I do know her coat looks great and she is in good health. I have tried other salmon oils that I did not like as much and will continue to stay with this brand.",4
My Chihuahua loves these and I give her one every day.  They are low in fat as well.,5
"Big enough for my 67 gram female gecko. She curls around the corners and still has about a fourth of room. She seems to prefer this to her other hide. Great product and highly recommend, especially for a 10 gallon tank",5
"Bought the one quart size. Have a bichon mix who has been crated after spinal surgery. I just use it for water as he comes out to eat his meals. I like that I can adjust the height. He couldn't stand in the beginning, but having the water bowl slightly off the ground kept him from spilling it and I was able to raise it as he became more mobile. It seems sturdy and well made. We'll continue to use it even after we're through with the crate.",5
"Fits my 22 lb cocker spaniel very well. I had gotten a lg one at first. Too big. He does not pull hard with this on, and walks nicely.",5
Bandit loves them :0),5
"This ball is VERY heavy and is too dangerous to throw to have my dog catch it.  If caught wrong he could get hurt.
This is not his favorite ball but he does play with it time to time.  Doesn't really entice my dog to play with it.",3
Perfect heater for my diamond back terrapins. They tend to tear up heaters and risk injuring themselves and the casing on this has protected them a great deal.,5
"I got this crate for my puppy and I like the partition part, so you can make the crate bigger as your puppy grows. My dog loves his crate and sometimes hi goes in it himself just to relax and chew his bully stick. I am very happy with it.",5
Got this November 1st and the pump went out and water went everywhere. This happened to our last one but we had it for 4 years but 3 months???? Never buying this product again!!!,1
"Great fountain.  Easy to set up and clean.  I put the stainless Steel parts in the dishwasher without any issue.  My only problem is the size.  It's perfect for a cat but a bit too small for my 30lb dog and requires me to fill it up more often.  For a medium to large dog, the larger fountains are better.",5
"Nice harness, just as expected",5
My goldfish has great color,5
"My cats love the Yeow catnip toys and they can really wrap their feet and mouths around these.  One of their favorite toys, but they go crazy (nanners) when playing with these.  Love that they come in packs of 3 as I have multiple cats and they are less expensive to purchase this way.",5
"Had to switch a cat to a poultry-only food. This is one of the few that actually doesn't contain other species (beef, fish, etc.). Feeding four cats on this and they all eat it up! Has a better price than some premium foods, too. Too bad the canned Natural Balance foods mix fish and chicken via fish oils.",5
"Prompt delivery and a generous amount.  This product covers a variety of ear conditions in an organic holistic approach. I had been using a vet prescribed antifungal that had never seemed to rid my dog of her ear problems. I began to suspect, from cleaning her ears, it was mites. I used this product immediately and the results is VERY PROMISING so far. The smell is similar to tea tree oil and it caused her NO DISCOMFORT or signs of irritation. If this product does the trick, (as it seems it is!) I will be very happy.",5
I have a Boxer who destroys everything within minutes. It took her a year to start pulling this apart. Well worth the money.,5
"No tangling, you can drive right over it, it's not going anywhere. Nothing sticks up above the ground other than the chain that you're going to attach to your dog's cable.

I guess the only con would be that you're not going to be able to move it once you place it without digging it out.

These would be great for attaching anything to the ground.",5
"Almost too beautiful to scoop poop! The filtering holes are little paws awww, and it almost makes you want to keep it as a silly decoration. Alas, something has to do the deed of the litter box hygiene, and so it shall be this beautiful tool. Plastic scoops all eventually end up in the trash and then in the landfill so it's worth the few extra bucks for a completely sanitizable reusable litter scoop. Make sure all the bacteria is good and dead and scoop in style. The scoop works wonderfully on hard or soft litter. I use both or mix, and easily can bleach, dip, and Dawn your way to a disease free abode and furrever healthy kitties.",5
"My dog, a beagle and shar-pei mix, has a sensitive stomach and this food seems to really agree with his system. The price for the big bag from Amazon was terrific.",5
The is the only way I buy millet for my 4 parakeets. The millet is much larger than what you can buy in retail stores and the amount you get for the money is outstanding. My birds rush to the millet as soon as I put it in the cage. There will obviously be loose millet at the bottom of the box; but I just put it in the feed cup. I truly feel this is an outstanding deal.,5
"I have been using this product religiously every time I do a water change and it has never let me down.  If you do not want to take chances, be safe and use as directed.",5
My dog likes this alot...I feel he is getting better nutrition...,5
Use it to keep the memory form in my dogs bed when I wash the cover!  Works perfectly!,5
"The good:

*  These are huge.  The pads I've been using aren't that big and I've been known to double up on them just to keep from those accidents that may happen when the dog uses the pad near the edge.  This size is especially nice for big dogs.

*  Absorbent - Just make sure you put the correct size up.  If you put the wrong size up, you'll end up with a lovely little puddle of urine that never goes anywhere.  Right size up, and it absorbs nicely.

The not as good:

*  At current pricing, I couldn't commit to buying these.  There are only 10 in a package.  Regardless of size, it's not like you want to leave the used pads out for days on end.  You'll dispose of them quickly and can rapidly go through the entire bag.

*  These don't have any odor control.  The current pads I use for the dog now use charcoal for odor control.  I simply can't go back to things that are strictly absorbent, but don't do anything about odor.  You can definitely smell urine as you pass by these pads.

So most of my stars are for size and absorbency.  If you got more in the package and they had some sort of odor control mechanism, these would be five stars.",3
"This is a great product for rainy or snowy days. I have washed mine twice. It comes out clean. My dog has had his for five months and has bit down a little hard but it came back to normal shape, nothing gets broken and he loves it! Of course when training him, I do not let him play with it without supervision. he has never ate one of his toys but is rough with stuffed animals and tears the stuffing and squeakers out. So he mostly gets tough toys, he really enjoys the chuck it products. He also loves for outside play the giggle ball which is touch and virtually unbreakable.",5
great value. they protect my hand from poo. need i say more.,5
"I ordered it for my African Dwarf Frogs.  The list of ingredients is better as doesn't have propyl glycol included.  I would give a 5 star rate if soft pellet had no wheat flour included.  Frogs are carnivores.  I feed this mthly & good to have in case of evacuation then the frogs have to eat frog pellets.
Their main diet is frozen bloodworms, beef heart, tiliapia & wild salmon (meant for human consumption).",4
Falls apart when you screw it on to cage,1
"Fantastic deal!  Nice gauge so bags are thick enough.  The free dispenser not so good, but the bags fit in the generic dispensers.  The lack of a center tube is a good thing for the environment.",4
Purchased the 6045 for additional flow in my 150 mixed reef. This power head moves a decent amount of water and has very good spread. It has an adjustment so you either have a straight stream or tone it down and spread the stream out so it's not blasting one area. Great pump which is expected from Tunze.,5
Excellent .,5
My cats won't eat these and they are unreturnable..Very sad,1
This didn't last our 45lb Golden Doodle long.,4
"Cats love this!  Actually, so do the dogs, but I save it for the cat.  In addition to being a treat, this product is also helpful when a dog or cat is refusing to eat.  It is tasty enough that a dog who is not eating might just begin to take a bite if this is sprinkled on top.",5
It would be fine for a short soft coated dog but for our Lab it doesn't really get deep into the fur. Also for a big dog as it is way too big for our little terrier. Back to using only our hands.,3
"I tried this awhile back, and noticed other folks reviews.

The cats don't like it (I have 3, ranging in age from 7 to 17).  At the time, I had 2 to 3 litter boxes.  The cats don't like to scratch pellets.  The litter box STOPPED BEING USED.  It seems kitties still like to scratch, dig and cover what feels natural - which is dirt.

I had to finally mix clay with the Pine.  While the Pine did mask odors somewhat (helps if you use more than one litter box in multi-cat households) - scooping pee was impossible (since there is no real clumping action - the pellets stay as pellets).  And with the lack of digging by cats - the poop went straight into the scooping bag.

I myself can't carry over 20 some pounds, so I highly recommend clay unscented litter - if ordering from Amazon - consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ever-Clean-Extra-Strength-Cat-Litter-Unscented-42-Pound-Box/dp/B003VNKNXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ever Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented, 42 Pound Box</a>.  If you scoop daily (or at the very least - every other day), your house won't smell, and the cat litter will last longer.

Unscented is best for cats (since the scented particles can be licked by cats off their fur - and the chemicals are so so).  And, while many cat owners use covered litter boxes (I USED to), its more convenient for the owners than the cats.  Cats end up not using the boxes from the smell on the lids, and they also end up spraying pee back on themselves.  So my house doesn't smell like cats (as noted by visitors), even though I have open cat litter boxes.",2
"Does its work, not much to say about a sponge. Fits the Aquaclear 20 correctly, and the bottom of the sponge is covered, not hollow. It not a hollow pipe, it's more like a pot or something like that.",5
"I wanted a nice heavy weighted bath house for my robo hamster, Nugget. This was a lot better than I was expecting most of the photos or reviews show the item being fairly small but my judgement is it's quite large especially if you have a dwarf hamster like myself. Colours are sent randomly but I received the one I actually hoped for so that was an added bonus. It's quite deep as well so it can hold a fair amount of sand. It's cute and I think its well worth the price,the package it was sent in was just a really small cardboard box it has no bubble wrap around or inside it so if the package isn't handled with care while transporting I'm sure it would crack. I bought bulk items so my order came in a large box of 4 other items and bubble wrap which may have helped protect it some what. All in all a lovely product :)",5
Returned item because it was not sturdy.,2
My cat loves this product.  It smells good and the cans are easy to open.  It's economical too.  Will be buying this again.,5
"My ""Golden"" loves her duckie. Unfortunately, it is filthy because of all that love and will NOT come cleaner at all!",5

I have to squeeze them really hard to squeak. My dog is a heavy chewer and cant even get a noise out them. Plus they don't bounce well,3
It is probably good and wholesome but my cat just has never liked anything from this brand and can't seem to get used to it. I've tried various different flavors and also the dry foods.,2
Great for the price! Purchased one 6 months ago and just ordered another.,5
"Snowy loves the chips, gets 2 after doing his business",5

"I wasted my money! I can't get a replace or refund from seller.
I don't need this whole bag.what should I do with this?
Honestly,the smell was not tasty.",1
great,5
"it is wonderful for my lab.  I watched her scoot over onto the pad and she loves laying on it. The large size works for her (she is 90 lbs.) but the extra large would be even better.  When my girl is finished using it, I will put it under my sheet to help me sleep through my hot flashes!!",5
"This smells clean; however, our 3 dogs go in and out of eating it.  They are the ones that need to give feedback for this, so I'm doing the best to be their voices :-)  Let's just say that the quality is good, but the taste doesn't wow my guys!",3

"Tall, sturdy and easy to assemble. Bought this condo before we'd even found our kittens, just knew they deserved the best. They don't really use the dangling rope and haven't slept in the little house since they were 2mos. It's perfect for them to get away from the dogs and first place they sharpen their claws in the morning.",5
"I used this product in the construction of my outdoor cold weather dog house. The product was easy to install,  and arrived with out any manufacture defects. My only complaint would be the poor design the magnet at the bottom. There is bit of play, making the closing a bit wonky, leaving the door to stay partially cracked occasionally. Functional, but would not have bought this product if I had seen in person.",3
Excellent product & service,5
Great price and my dog loves them!,5
My puppy eats Eukanuba and it can get expensive over time.  I went with this package to save money (as opposed to the smaller bags) and I am pleased with how well it kept.  I was surprised to find that a bag of this size lasted me a little over a month.  I have a 7 1/2 month old Standard Poodle and I currently feed him about two cups and a half a day.,5
Works a described.  Great company!,5

"I have three Miniature Dachshunds. I know it seems weird that we buy the 24"" version of this toy due to the size of the breed, but they like to have the larger toy to play with. My younger two dogs absolutely love these toys (in every variety so far) and they last even after they're torn. The first thing that my dogs destroy are the squeakers, although they don't tear up the toy, they eliminate the squeak. After a while, they are able to gnaw holes in the fabric of the toys. Do not let this deter you from purchasing these toys as my two dogs will keep gnawing until they rip a toy to shreds... toys in the past would last maybe a week if we lucked out; these toys last an average of a month or more before we need to throw them out. Even when it's time to throw them out, the dogs still want to play with them!",4
"Love puppia, however, they are better suited for small, or extremely well-trained larger ones.  Not strong enough for my exuberant (at times) 70lb 1 year old, nerdy soft and comfy though!",4
"It's difficult to rate a dog food as I don't get to eat it!..However, my dogs do seem to like it and the ingredients look to be very good. A good indicator of high quality dog food is that there is less waste in the yard - more gets absorbed - better ingredients. Time will tell regarding my dogs health and in terms of vet visits.....so far, so good.",4
The dogs here at my dog daycare love these treats. I use them for training and just an all around treat during the play day!,5

REASONS THIS BED IS SO IDEAL:

1. It adjusts to body temperature so the dog will not overheat (The Chow had a much denser coat than the bare bellied Bulldog and both dogs have been equally enamored with the bed and use it year round.)

2. It's sized perfectly for crates. We use the 24"" X 18"" Quiet Time in the Bulldog's crate and ordered an additional one for her to lie on around the house or for when she's outside. (See Video...)

3. It's durable, soft, easy to clean, DOES NOT SHED, and is incredibly well priced. Also, the cinnamon color doesn't get dingy and dirty looking as fast as the paler shades and it's also softer, fuzzier and plusher than the white Midwest bed. (We've tried both.)

4. Dogs just adore it and 'Sooner or later' you gotta get one!",5
Great product! My yorkies love them.,5
Both my cats eat their food eagerly with the Petdophilus powder so it agrees with them.  I look forward to gradual improvement in my cats' health.  Thank you.,5
"I love this container for dog food. I can buy large bags and not worry if it will stay fresh, saving me money. It's also very convenient b/c I just keep a scoop in it and it also rolls easily when I clean my floors. It's not flimsy and actually my cats enjoy sitting on it.",5
"Such a bummer...we are just a few days outside our return window... I REALLY wanted to like this and now I am bummed I cannot return it.  The fountain is quiet and relatively easy to operate.  It only took a day for both our cats to get used to it and start drinking from it.  Unfortunately, a couple days ago we noticed that the stainless steel started to turn a hazy grey color from build-up on the ""steel"".  We use purified Arrowhead drinking water that we have delivered to our door to fill the fountain, so there should be no build-up.  We cannot get it off when we clean it.  Also, one of our cats had a large bump form on his lip that developed last week.  We took him to the vet and he said that it was likely ""cat acne"" due to the plastic part at the top of the fountain.  Cats are not supposed to drink from plastic, as it holds bacteria in it.  We noticed this cat was drinking straight off that part (as opposed to our other cat who drinks from the reservoir).  So, we need to return this, but cannot since Amazon only gives a 30 day window and we are sitting at 36 days now.  Pretty lame.",1
My dog loves balls.  All sizes and all types of materials.  She can grab this one easily and carry it around the back yard.  She shakes it in her mouth so much that I think it will break -- but it doesn't.,5
"It cost me 2.56 and works perfectly. My few complaints are that it only comes with one suction cup, so it kind of floats, and that I have no way of detaching the wire so that I can take advantage of my air hose hole in the lid of my tank (which would have been preferable).",5
"Big bag, and mostly whole pieces.  I have ordered other brands and they come crushed to almost a powder.  I was pleased to see the larger chunks of chicken still intact.  Maggie loves them!",5
the water fills up too high.,2
Product works great,5
I like this crate. My only complaint is that one small part of the thinner metal bars came a bit bent - but it doesn't make a difference in the stability of the crate. I like that it folds up for traveling and that it has two doors so you can put it just about anywhere.,5
"TINY. This rope toy may be good for toy breeds, but not for ANY bigger dogs. Yes, it's 16"" long (18"" long if you count the tassle) BUT the rope is very thin - only 1/2"" thick. I cannot give it to my dog. He would tear this apart in under a minute. The description for this item is deceptive and the pictures makes it look much bigger than what it really is. Very disappointed! Sending it back.",1
Two of my cats love the dried Bonito flakes and are disappointed when I run out. I call them stinky fish as they do have a slight odor as you open the bag. This is a nice sized bag with good size flakes,4
My dogs love this treat.,5
my dogs love these and they have had no issues with them,5
Great pool for the dog. Just expensive. Cut the price and sell more.,4
Have a finicky food eater he or she will eat it with this on it.,5
"Absolutely love these dog beds. Our dogs love them too. Works great for us since we keep our room cold at night and knowing dogs they won't keep a blanket on them...so this does the job for us, consistently. Our dogs don't get cold, and they're comfortable....I would recommend the orthopedic one though. I got that for our second dog and it's a lot better support wise and more flat our old one is hard to get flat....or maybe just add some foam?",5
"I HAVE BEEN FEEDING MY CAT THIS BRAND FOR 12 YEARS, SHE LOVES ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS AND REMAINS TRIM AND HEALTHY.",5
"Perhaps the most important question to ask when choosing a dog treat is where it originates. According to the Dingo website, ""Dingo Chicken & Sweet Potato Strips Recipe are made with USA sourced ingredients and include Chicken as the #1 ingredient."" Although some treats boast that they are ""made in the USA,"" they may be made with ingredients imported from who-knows-where. I like that Dingo says that their ingredients are USA sourced.

The second thing you want to know is whether the dog likes it. In my case, the answer is a resounding YES! Nigel, my miniature poodle, absolutely loves these. These strips are a bit chewier than some of his other favorites, such as Beggin' Strips and Pup-peroni. Those get inhaled as soon as they leave my fingers, while these strips take a bit longer for him to chew. That is probably a good thing.

Others have commented on the strong smell. I didn't really notice it just from opening the bag to remove Nigel's nightly treat, but they do have a strong smell. That is probably not a bad thing, as animals tend to like things that smell like food.

There are about 25 strips in the bag, so one bag will last almost a month at one piece per day. They do not have a recommended serving based on the size of the dog, but I give my 13 lb. poodle one strip.

These treats will be a part of the treat rotation at our house!",5
"In the past I have used Feralvilla outdoor wooden houses for feral cats, which they love because they can climb up inside, be completely hidden and stay toasty warm in cold weather.  They are also less expensive, better insulated and sturdier than the Kitty Tube, in my opinion.  That being said, I now live in a townhome community with neighbors in close proximity and needed a house for 2 feral toms (recently trapped and neutered) who have been hanging around my street.  I needed a house that would not be obvious as a cat shelter, which unfortunately the Feralvillas are, so I wouldn't draw too much attention from my neighbors.  The Kitty Tube looks like a composting bin or a small garbage can, so it blends in with the shrubs and recycle bin in my small front yard.  I added a second layer of non-toxic Reflectix insulation around the interior and floor, and then some straw.  I haven't seen the cats use it yet, but feral cats generally will not use shelters in warm weather, but in cold, wet, snowy and windy weather.  The flaws in this design are all the drain and ventilation holes.  All the extra holes are access points for moisture to get in, especially the roof vent cap, which I don't understand at all.  And something is wrong with the design if you need drainage holes in the bottom. The wooden houses I have used never had water seeping, but this one does.  I sealed all the holes with Gorilla tape on both sides.  However, we had a lot of rain recently and the roof vent cap, even with all the tape covering it, leaked.  The roof is slightly concave, not domed, so water sits on the roof and slowly seeps in. I went back and added silicone around the gaskets in the roof vent cap, door awning and floor holes and resealed with more Gorilla tape.  If the silicone and tape don't work, I'm tossing the Kitty Tube and going back to Feralvilla.  Expensive lesson!

O.k., update a couple weeks and a few rainstorms later. I'm sorry to say, but I have downgraded my opinion of the Kitty Tube to piece of expensive junk!  I was right about the roof vent cap- it leaks no matter how you try to modify it.  With the vent cap in place, it leaks.  Without it, using a thick piece of plastic on both sides to cover the hole and sealed with Gorilla tape, it leaks.  With the vent cap back on and silicone added around the gasket, it leaks.  With still more silicone and then more Gorilla tape around the cap, it leaks.  I guess if you live in an area where it never rains or snows, the Kitty Tube would work outdoors, or if you keep it in a barn, garage or maybe even a carport where no rain or snow will settle on the roof, then perhaps.  But as an outdoor house, while the concept is good, the fabrication stinks.  I contacted the company to see if they can make a replacement lid without a hole in the roof, but they said no.  And then asked me to make sure I had installed everything correctly, like the handle awnings, to make sure it wasn't leaking somewhere else.  I am not an idiot: I know how to snap on handle awnings and I know exactly where this thing leaks.  I also have a strong feeling that sitting on wet ground, water will also eventually pool up inside the floor of the Kitty Tube.  This company needs to pay attention to these reviews and get rid of all the extra holes to fix the leaks!  For me, this house was a complete waste of money.  The Kitty Tube is going back to the recycling center and I'm going back to Feralvilla, and not worry about what my neighbors think!",1
"My dogs have been eating Wellness brand food and treats for years, and I appreciate that Wellness has high-quality ingredients and also that the dogs find their foods delicious. My 16 year old shepherd/chow mix has a wheat allergy and it's nice to find biscuit-type treats for him that he enjoys.  He's been eating these particular biscuits for a decade or longer, and loves them very much.",5
"When I finally realized that a 35lb bag of dogfood was only a few dollars more than the 17.5lb bags I'd been buying, I knew I would need a new container. I appreciate all the other reviews that helped me make the choice to buy this one.  I like that there are no wheels on this 40lb version and that it is tall and narrow so it takes vertical space rather than horizontal. It easily holds the 35lb small bite kibble dog food and seems to seal it in to keep out bugs etc.  It has a lid that secures onto the container body and forms a seal by way of a rubber insert.

It came with no directions and the rubber insert was not pre-fitted, so I am not a 100% sure I fit the rubber insert properly: it doesn't snap into any groove on the lid or clip onto the rim of the main body of the container - it just kind of lies in place.  But it seems to work.  The lid also has a round hatchtype insert which you spin to open.  You can spin it quite tight to close which might make it a bit tough to open if you have arthritis in your hands.  If I tighten it too tight I feel it in my tennis elbow when I unscrew it.  You may remove the lid entirely if you feel you need a bit of extra room to access the main container, but it is not as easy or convenient to pull the whole lid off as it is to unscrew the hatch. If you have a physical ailment that would stop you from grasping and spinning the hatch, I would not pick this container - I would pick one with a flip/clip lock.

I do like it a lot and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I only gave it four stars as it did crack within the first minutes of owning it.  I was washing it in the kitchen sink and as it is large, awkward and wet the container slipped out of my hand and hit the granite counter top (maybe a fall of a foot). That was enough to put a crack in the corner of the container (not the lid.) The crack is not one you can move, rather a small crack like you might see in a car windshield - it still functions but is probably weakened. I felt that it should have survived that small impact.  At that point, as the kids had already turned the box into a car, I could not return the item and decided it would be fine.  I have had it for a few months now and still love it, and if it ever did need replacing I would replace it with the same.",4

It is washable which is a positive. There is enough room on it for two of our dogs or one dog and three cats at times. Life is ok. Good product. I will buy it again when required to.",5

There was plenty of room for even more food in the bigger saucer that came in the pack (pink) one. I wish it was shaped round though do I could put it in his dog dish.  Other than that, he can now actually taste his food when he eats it.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5

Durable for fetch and tugging. My dog destroyed the squeaker right away though.,5
Fade in/out on the Satellite Pro is great at gradually acclimating fish to changing environment.  Fish used to jump every time old timer flicked lights on/off.  Great price.  One grief:  Timer's internal clock is a bit fast.  Have to adjust every couple months but only by about 10 minutes.,4

They were for my formal living room, so I had high expectations, and they met them! I bought medium size, which for my Boston Terrier and Miniature Schnauzer are actually a bit big, but sometimes they like to snuggle together in one, so it's fine. I bought the brown beds, which are very rich in color. They are plush, but don't expect tempurpedic quality; if you have an older dog, splurge on an orthopedic bed.",5

His coat and skin look much better, which is impressive given how severe his skin problems are. Highly recommend!",5

"My cats loved this scratching pad...until it fell apart. They seemed to really like the incline, and it came with cat nip which is always fun!  But the cardboard pad comes out of the incline base, and my cats got pretty good at pulling the pad out.  And once the pad was out they set their minds on tearing apart the base (which is basically an incline shaped cardboard box).  We spent a lot of time reassembling/repairing it, but after about a month it was past the point of no return and had to be trashed.  That being said, for the price I didn't expect it to last too long, and if your cats aren't bent on destruction then it may last longer for you.",4
My rat wasn't impressed...,3
Who wants to swim in polluted water ? Not my fish. This stuff is great buy it once and its good forever. Just recharge once in awile. A real cost saver in the long run.,5
Very Good,5
We have used many cat fountains over the years and I am REALLY pleased with this one! The easiest to clean and my cat loves to use it. It is very quiet. The low voltage power cord can be taken apart simply so that you can pick the unit up to take to the sink and clean it without the messy dangling tangle of cords other brands have on their units making it so hard to wash the cat dish. The flow is just right and cats have choices at what level they want to use. The filters are not overly expensive either.,5
"My cats usually love Halo dry food, but this doesn't seem to be such a hit with them.  They usually aren't picky and rarely leave any in their bowls, but sometimes do with this kibble.  I mix it with other grain-free dry food, and that way they don't leave any behind.",4

"NACOCO Pet Standing Water Dispenser

I have two (very spoiled) exotic persian cats, that have very flat faces. One likes to drink from a coffee mug on the counter and the other drinks form a water fountain and a bowl.  The water fountain/bowl drinking cat eats wet for, so he is always getting his water nasty with wet food gunk after his first drink.  I clean their water containers at least twice a day, and they are always still getting really dirty.

I thought this would be fantastic because they already have issue with being able to drink out of a bowl or dish because of their flat faces, and this will cut down on the dirtying up of the water bowls.  I was pumped when this arrived and immediately washed all the parts in soapy water and assembled the water dispenser.  My bowl drinking cat was not interested (I didn't think he would be interested) but the other was very inquisitive of what this was and was climbing all over it.

After I set this up and filled it with water, my cat was just kind of confused and I used my finger to get drips coming out of the dispenser part.  He just kept looking at where the drops were landing and did not realize that they were coming out of the dispenser.  After messing around with it for a while I left it alone and my cat picked it up and started using it!

For now, eh does not use it as his exclusive means of water, but I do think he really likes it (like a toy) and I see him using it quite a bit.  My cats are prone to urinary issues (because of their breed) so it is really important that they drink as much water as they can.  I like having all of the different water options because they really help them get tons of water.  This has been a great addition and I am really happy with it.

*I received this water dispenser at a free or discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review. No promise of a 5 star review was made by me to the seller. I highly value reviews when purchasing a product and rely on them when selecting products for purchase, therefore, this review is entirely that of my own.

I hope that this review as helpful in your decision as to deciding whether you will purchase this product.",5
"Very well made bell strip. Attaches easily to any type of door knob.  We put one inside and another outside the door for our pup to ring when we're not paying attention.  She picked it up very quickly.  The bells ring loudly enough to hear easily.  The great thing about these is if you have no doggie door, or travel, there's a way for your dog to alert you of his/her need to go out!! Love it!!!",5
"clip on the small side,  rope could be softer.  like the color, handle is sturdy",3
I have an English bulldog that destroys most plush toys in minutes. She worked on this one for about 30 minutes before he was missing his fins and tail. Very cute toy and fairly sturdy.,4
"My English Bulldog, 14 months, housebroken,  only used it for about 2 hours.  A little bit of water from drinking left a drop of wet mark from mouth. Was only water!  When I tried to wipe it off when  dried , I could not get it off.  I would not recommend.  Item is not as describe.",1
"Here is what my dog said about this toy ""woof oorf woow wooooof gruff""  Google translate didn't have a clue but a rough translation would be: ""Thank you for the toy daddy, I am going to chew it then shove it in your mouth while you sleep""  he loves it.

It is quite tough and brings back memories of the show ""lamb chop"" whenever I see it.",5
My Japanese Chin both love these!!,5
"I ordered the large size crock for my dogs food and the jumbo size for his water. Both are super big, but they get the job done. I feed my boy a cup of dry taste of the wild twice per day, and the kibbles barely cover the bottom of the dish. If you have a dog that's a messy eater/drinker, I guess ordering these super large can help with that. They're pretty classic with no fancy features or bells and whistles. If your dog has bad mealtime habits, I think these would be difficult to knock over or destroy and chew up.",4
"This is a MUST buy item if you love your feline friend. I purchased this as a special deal here on Amazon. Its has been 7 days, my bored orange cat is now a happy cat. He has slept, climbed, clawed, played in the cat tree for hours.

1. Box arrives directly from Amazon in a box from the manufacturer - the box arrived broken, but upon further inspection the company packed it well.
2. It took me about 2 hours to assemble the tree from start to finish - I would lay out all the pieces - lettered in order - to facilitate easy assembly. I started bottom and worked my way up. It comes with all the screws and tools you will need. It's that simple.
3. It comes also with 2 hanging cat toys to entertain and entice your cat to go to the highest level.

My initial impressions after one week - this is not only sturdy, but cheaper than any ""pet store"" alternatives you'll find. The store brand trees are the same price but half the size. Costco comes the closest - they sell a 60.00 cat tree, but its made out of sturdy 4x4 - its too heavy to lift and you need a truck to buy one. I'm planning to move in the next few months and I saved the box and instruction so I can just disassemble and pack it up for the mover. If you find a good price, don't think about it. Just buy it. If your hesistant, think about all the joy you'll bring to your cat this year. Happy Holidays.",5
"This toy keeps my very active Shiba Inu busy for quite a while.  I fill it with a mix of Buddy Bits so she doesn't get bored with the same treat flavor: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006STN0E/ref=rcxsubs_mys2_product_title
Product is very durable and plastic case has  withstood chewing and tossing. Highly recommended for busy dogs!!",5
Great pricing and the same product you buy at the PetXX place. Just cheaper...,5
Great item and value for the price,4
"My dog is not kennel trained but she sleeps in this during the day.  I leave the door open so she can come and go, she loves it.

It is very sturdy and will last a long time, very pleased with the workmanship and design.",5
"got these mats because I was so tired of cleaning up the litter mess around the litter boxes.  I got 2 mats to make sure I had enough coverage around the 2 boxes that are placed together. does a great job of keeping the excess litter close to the box and not tracked throughout the house. the mats can be vacuumed, swept, wiped down or even just lifted and shaken. these are much larger than what i could find in stores--even pet supply stores--and similar pricing to smaller mats.  very happy with this purchase!",5
My Zoey loves these.,5
"I don't know why the cats prefer this semi-cardboard box to a fabric bed, but they always choose this. I appreciate the new feature of having three removal trays to give it longer life.",4
"I love this harness, but the size chart is SOOOO INCORRECT! The small size was for a stuffed animal.  My small terrier mix (15lbs) needed a medium.  The small wouldn't even go past her head.",5
Great seller!!! Item received fast and just as described. Thank you!!!!!!!,5
"I have three adorable, demanding, and picky indoor-only rescued cats, all over 10 years old. I usually leave Purina ""Beyond"" dry food down for them to eat when they want (which I notice they have an early morning breakfast and a midnight snack), and give them a little Fancy Feast canned cat food mixed with Vetoquinol Viralys Powder for dinner. I accidentally ordered Purina One Indoor Advantage when I meant to buy Purina Beyond Superfood Blend (both Purina and blue bags). Also, because of their age, I have to be even more cautious about what I feed them so they can stay healthy. Being picky and spoiled, they were not happy with the food switch. They did eat the Purina One...but now they are overeating it. I have to be careful about how much I leave down because otherwise they eat until they are sick, which they very seldom do with Purina Beyond. I like that both One and Beyond are made in the U.S. and that the top ingredient is the real protein like turkey or salmon, unlike most popular, budget-friendly pet food. But Beyond goes a step further and does not use poultry by-product meal, corn, wheat, or soy. One Indoor Advantage is the opposite, three of the main ingredients are corn gluten meal, poultry by-product meal, and soybean meal. This may be why my cats are overeating, maybe it is because they do not like the switch, but it also may be because they do not feel full. Beyond does cost a little more, but my cats usually do not binge on it, so the price balances out in the long run. It is always best to read the directions closely, as the bag says this is for indoor adult cats only, this is a bad option for kittens and pregnant cats, and there are much better choices for outdoor or (like mine) older cats.",3
"I'm a foster mom for my local Humane Society shelter and I just bought a Midwest cat playpen off of Craigslist for my five-week and older set, but it was missing the shelf bed. I decided to purchase two, since I only needed one shelf for holding food and water bowls. I'm glad I did, because the kittens love stretching out on these plush pillows. They are thick and soft and quite nice to the touch. I was skeptical about their ability to stay put with the Velcro system, but it works just fine. The color is a rich caramel that reminds me of a Werther's candy. It really livens up the look of the playpen. I've included some pictures so you can see them in action for yourself. I love mine and, more importantly, so do the kittens.",5
The clippers work great on a big dog's nails as well as on the nails of a little dog.  I would definitely recommend them.,5
"Great for any small dog that likes to cuddle. I put in a baby receiving blanket. She is happy, happy.",5
"I purchased this for a cat, not knowing if he would let me use it on him, well, he loves it. And it really works well to get all the loose fur before it floats all over the house.",5
"this is the best. my ammonia skyrocked, because  I screwed up like any newb would do. but I put ATM colony in and my parameters went down to normal 0 ammonia in two days. By the first day it was all but detectable",5
"Best bang for the buck, I use this to drive my co2 Reactor.. Buy it guys!!",5
"seen no improvements, used a different product prior and the other product I noticed did help.  Tried this one because it was cheaper but you get what you pay for.  Stopped subscription",3
Betta took a week or two to catch on but he uses it!,5
"Update 7/16/2017 My dog still loves this and her coat us shinier even though she was already on a high quality food. I am so happy that I tried it.

I found an incredible deal on this but I only ordered 2 bags because my dog rejects many foods. I took a chance, figuring I would give one bag away if she wouldn't eat it. Well, I just ordered 2 more bags and I'm glad I did before the price more than doubled. I have never seen her empty her bowl so quickly. Love the ingredients and the sourcing. ""Lamb and Bison"" is a little deceiving, though. The lamb is not lamb meal, so tbere is probably actually more chicken and turkey than lamb, and the bison is listed after beet pulp, so it is minimal. Still good protein sources, just an odd choice of labelling. Love the company's commitment. Dog Food Advisor rates highly, and they are super critical. I just hope I can find another deal before we run out of stock.",5
"Andrew just turned 11 and has been on this a couple of years now.  Hannah lived to be slightly over 14, including 72 weeks of chemo for lymphoma, and while I credit several things--most importantly good genes from careful breeding--I think adding a senior vitamin has to help as well.  I like this brand and the Amazon price is cheaper than getting them at the vet's office.",5
I rescued a 6 month old German Shepard mix puppy that weighed 24 pounds in July. Started feeding her this and the Wellness dry food and she has grown to 45 pounds and is a very happy puppy! She loves it and gladly has eaten it since day 1!,5
While the shipping was good - the product was poor.  the handle loop broke off of two of these that I had purchased.  I thought it was a fluke the first time so I ordered another and same thing happened.,2
Frequent dental procedures can get expensive. JoJo and Pebbles love these chews. If they can cut down on the frequency of dentals they will be more than worth the cost. Besides they are a real treat for them.,5
"Was great at first (even though it had a very strong plastic smell. You need to air it out or wash it first), but then the zipper broke in 2 months and we didn't even use it often. The buckles make it easier to put on and remove the seat cover",3
"This product did as described but my dogs broke out into rashes. I took them to a vet and she couldn't explain it, said normally dogs don't react to this product. Maybe I have weird dogs but I will not be using this produt again.",4
"I have and raise Yorkies and I now feed only TOTW dry food.  Since switching exclusively to this food, I have happy, healthy dogs and pups in great health with beautiful coats.  They turned their little noses up at other dry foods, including Blue Buffalo, but they love this food and run to eat it.  I only use Wetlands or High Prairie (in adult and puppy) so I cant speak to the other flavors.  I tried the pacific salmon one but couldn't deal with the fishy breath and the dogs did not seem as excited about it.  I love the fact that it has bison and duck (depending on which variety you chose) and is full of good things for them without all the fillers and harmful things.  This added to the chicken and veggies I cook for them keeps my babies happy and healthy.",5
"perfect...exactly what I expected..nice size bowls for our 48 lb pit mix ""Cabela""...raised bowls are supposed to be easier on them...so why not :)",5
"My 12-year-old beagle has been using this shampoo since she was nine weeks old and we love it  - great foaming, wonderful scent, rinses out well, good container.  Very happy with it!",5
"Product does work as described. Per my Veterinarians suggestion, I purchased the Advantix II. My dog is very allergic to flea bites, and this product will protect her. She had no adverse reaction to the product, just apply as directed on the package. There is no unpleasent smell, or greasy marks where its applied. This product will keep her protected from fleas, ticks, mosquitos & biting lice!",5
These last long enough to keep our dog busy for quite a whilE. She is typically done with chew toys/bones/etc. In less than 30 minutes. We have had this out for 3 or 4 days now and she is still interested in it! Great for keeping her busy while we are gone.,5
"I have 3 cats. They all seem to enjoy this brush at different levels. I have a fat shorthaired manx who absolutely loves it. It pulls an entire cat worth of hair off of him and he still has a lot left over. lol

Works okay on my Himalayan, she is longer haired.

Easy to clean, for only $5, I recommend this!",5
"Very cute and has matching collars available.  Perfect for my almost 30 lb puppy, and would do well with much larger dogs.  My favorite feature is the clip.  We got this when my puppy was 6 months old and VERY wiggly and excited as soon as she saw the leash.  The clip just presses on to the collar and hooks, no pulling on a little lever while wrangling a squirmy pup.  It's also easy to open and take off the collar.  Plus is looks really fun and festive in bright purple and the other fun patterns.",5
Quick shipping and arrived as advertised.,5
"Hope theirs nothing bad in them because my dogs really love them.  They ""sit"" without a command for these. So many recalls on chicken flavored pet items lately.  Hope these stay safe!",5
I don't see a big difference between these and using a round cotton swab with warm water on my Westie's allergic eyes. I wish they worked better.,3
"Don't know what I'd do without it... have a big mess I guess.
This mat came rolled up tightly and smelled like rubber badly. I flattened it and left it sitting outside for 2 days... Then brought it back in. It catches litter off her feet just like it should. I can pick it up and pour it all back into the litter box very easily.",5
"Cats seemed to like it, looked healthy, like the size of the cans",4
"Ohhhh yaaaa.  I am to old to be mopping up messes non-stop, so I got these because of watching a friend's pup.  Wala!  That took care of that problem.  I had ones like these several years ago for a large dog that just would not quit marking.  Good dog, BUT...  He quit when we used these on him.  I love them and would highly recommend them.  Such a simple solution.  You CAN keep that awesome dog that just has a little flaw.",5
"I'm afraid I can't tell the difference and I've waited over a week.  My cat decides he wants to ""rough-house"" in the middle of the night or early morning (between 3:30 a.m. & 5:30 a.m)...that usually includes running across my bed (while I'm in it!); scratching on my mattress foundation loudly; or knocking things off counters causing loud banging startling sounds ....all this, just to wake me up to keep him company.  This behavior, I'll admit, is not as bad now, but still annoying enough I've thought about finding him a loving home, but he's so lovable during the daylight, HUMAN, hours (sigh).  A friend suggested a shock collar, but that seems so inhumane.  I'll keep using this and hope things get better.  I'll update if that happens.",3
My dog loves these.  I give him three every morning in his breakfast.  No fleas that I've noticed and he feels good.  I will reorder when I run low.,5
Looked the same and had the same ingredients as the Henry Schein soft chews from Butler.,5
"It's a good size to sell for new customers who just want to try out a small batch of SPS' hay. In my opinion, it should be cheaper (possibly $5 instead?). Nevertheless, SPS 2nd Cutting is awesome. My first purchase was in Jan '16. Definitely better than Carefresh hay.",5
Trace is a great fertilzer and all of my plants seem to repond well to it. Seachem makes a great line but it can get expensive fast.,5
This thing is great. My pets love being brushed with it and it is so easy to use. I use it on a German Shepherd and Maine Coon cats. I highly recommend it and would buy more.,5
"Okay this product is way bigger than I thought it was going to be, but kitty loves it! Scratches on it, lounges on it. I've had it for about 4 months now and it looks barley used, so the cardboard is very hearty",5
Great price for these treats.,5
THESE ARE GREAT! ALL MY DOGS WILL WEAR THESE ! This is because they can still feel the ground unlike conventional booties. They are somewhat tricky to first get on but they get easier as you get the hang of it-- and you can get at least 6 walks out of them (I walk about 5 miles per walk) . Dont think they will get less tight however if you go a size up --the only thing that gets bigger is the paw section but the rubber band around the leg is the same size. This is my only criticism. The part that holds them on is really small . It will loosen with use but it is tight at first.,5
"Recommended by vet for our 14 yo lab mix who was showing considerable anxiety, confusion, wandering, getting lost in the house, ""out of it"" signs of dementia. It took about 2 weeks, but we have noticed considerable improvement in symptoms. No, Sage is not back to the ""wise old man"" of his younger years, but he is much less confused and anxious, much more responsive and alert. He does not like the large pill, which we puncture and spread on his food -- he does not seem to mind the flavor. It has made enough of a difference that we will maintain him on it.",4
lovebird loves it as well as the cockatiel,5
I use these all the time for my bearded dragons. I've never had a bulb blow out and they produce a great amount of heat.,4
my dog is getting on in years and i wanted a product that she would eat and be good for her.  i mix this with some wet dog food and she seems to be enjoying every bit of it.  i have tried several different kinds and she really likes them all.  would recommend this product and will continue to use it.,5
"My dogs love whimzees! I love that this design especially seems to take a little longer to get through for aggressive chewers and it wears down nicely as they chew. My dogs are under 20 lbs, and it is perfect for them. I can see larger breeds going through them much faster, and maybe not ideal for all breeds if you want a chew that lasts. My dogs all have solid stools after too, no g.i. upset.",5
Absolutely love my new grooming table - no more sitting in the floor to groom.,5
"Love the concept and I think this will work for young kittens. My older cats are not taking to this at all.  I am going to keep trying but I think trying to get an older cat to switch over is going to be harder than the manufacturer says it will be.  My cats simply won't use it.  Looks like I'm going to have to remove the original box and keep this system in the room they have a litter box in hopes it forces them to use it.  And yes, I have followed the directions.  If I can get them to use the system, this would definitely make my life easier.  No more vacuuming up kitty litter in the house when they drag it out of the box!",5
Our dog did a taste test of several leading 5 star dry dog foods and chose this one.  We make a thick gravy our of Newmans all beef can food and mix a little with the dry.,5
"This is a great product! Ive purchased it multiple times and each time they have arrived quickly and safely. This product will stay in the water column for quite a long period of time which gives your little fish more time to eat. Overall great product, just make sure you refrigerate it!

Taylor",5
Awesome product!,5
"I absolutely love this water dispenser. The small is the perfect size for one small pet (I have a cat). I do not use the filter with this and I make sure to clean the stainless dish regularly. You flip the bottle upside down to fill it, then screw the lid on. When you flip back over, water stays in the bottle until you attach it to the base (which you can turn to lock it in place). Very convenient, especially if you have an animal that likes to tip over water bowls.",5
"It's the perfect size for my large dog. I love the expandable feature, making it easy to make it as shallow or deep as needed. It's especially fantastic for dog park visits and hiking.",5
"My fault for not reading carefully. My dogs are raw food eatters and I purchased this item thinking it was like sojos or k9 brand dehydrated raw dog food. In this way, I was not please; however, this was my fault. on the bright side, this is one of the only non-raw dog foods that my smallest dog did not get sick on... AND, I've been through 3 bags now before discovering it's not raw... therefore, for a non raw dog food, i give it top scores...",4
Yummy treats that my dogs love,5
"VERY GOOD HOWEVER MY DOGS ARE OICKY AND ONE LIKES THEM AND THE OTHER DOES NOT,",4
perfect fit,5
not very strudy.,2
It's a really awesome tool for my 75 pound german shepherd!! The only thing I don't typically like it the lack of strength from the included nail file.,4
Works great but using other bags is a chore. I used up all the free bags then I never used it again.,4
Litter works pretty good. My cats are not fans of it though. But keeps the smell down (I have a Savannah breed cat) clumps pretty well,4
Seems accurate. Suction cups suck because they don't suck.,3
Da Bird is strong great toy for Bengals.,5
My australian shepherd loves these out of the ball thrower!!!,5
Great product. A+++++ service.,5
My dogs love these! Great prices too!,5
Very small like about the size of the average females pinkey finger maybe a little smaller,2
"I've just finished my 4th bottle and have re-ordered four more.  The dogs love it and it's easy to use.  I've definitely noticed a difference in the quality of their coats - shinier and smoother.  Also, it does cut down on the amount of shedding.  I only gave 4 stars because I expected the shedding to almost completely stop.  It's worth buying, but they do still shed some.  This is peak shedding time so that might be part of the problem.  Either way, I'll continue to buy.",4
"Il start with saying that my dogs ate the bed.
My review is about how easy (1hour since they got it) was to tear it apart in the middle. I had same bed from another manufacture and it was lasting for 2 years.",3
I heard good things about this product and read the reviews. My dog hates it and can always get it off his snout. It turned out to be a waste of money.,2
Dog loves em.  1/3 of the bag is already gone.,5
"Wish I had looked at the reviews before I purchased it, but they are accurate. Instead of realistic feathers, there are 2 heavy plastic feathers and some plasticy rope. I took off that crummy stuff and attached a bundle of cheap twine that flies around a lot better and doesn't wallop my cat in the face, and she loves it. It's a much longer wand and string than any other toys I have, and I think she likes that, while the retractable wand and string keep things manageable, though it feels flimsy.",1
"Great Dog food, the best my boxer dog JJ loves it... ... more so you need to look at the ingredients amazing.",5
Perfect my dogs love it.,5
I do not know what it is about the fleas this year but they seem to be immune to everything! I tried this out of desperation because the name brand advantage didn't seem to be working and I thought I'd try this since the price was good. After two applications (the second 3 weeks after the first) I did not see any difference in the amount of fleas on the dogs and cats. I purchased both the cat and dog oft his brand and neither worked on the animals. We live in the southeast and the fleas seem to be more aggressive than fleas in the past.,2
Dog loves it,5
"My cat Renesme loves to chew cords! She has snacked on an XBOX cord, several phone charging cords, and my laptop cord...just to name a few.

We were almost out of hope when I came across the critter cord. They were low enough cost that it was worth a shot.

Since adding these to my cords, we have not had any further issues of chewed cords! Thry are simple to put on thr cords and there is enough in each package to protect several cords.

A must if your furr baby is costing you money in destroyed cords!!",5
"If you buy the Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals in the 7 pound bag (instead of two 3.5 pound bags) then you can save about $6 because you are not paying for the extra packaging.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultra-Pet-Cat-Litter-Pearls-Micro-Crystals-7-Pound-Bag/dp/B001LUQ3WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultra Pet Cat Litter Pearls Micro Crystals, 7-Pound Bag</a>&nbsp;. Just use about half of the 7 pound bag and store the rest in an air tight container like an empty plastic kitty litter container with a lid.

I switched to the Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals because my cat hated the crystal litter that comes with the ScoopFree Litter Box since cheaper crystal litters feel like walking on broken glass for my cat's overly sensitive paws. See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ScoopFree-Ultra-Self-Cleaning-Litter-Box/dp/B000XSC8R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ScoopFree Ultra Self-Cleaning Litter Box</a>. Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals has the consistency of soft sands and works with the ScoopFree litter box. My cat now loves to poop in the Ultra Pet crystal litter since it is just like sand and took to it like a duck to water. The Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals also seem to have the added advantage of lasting about as twice as long as the cheaper crystal litter that comes with the ScoopFree machine (for my particular model) so the Ultra Pet Micro Pearls are worth the extra cost since you seem to get twice as much usage out of it. Some reviewers don't like the Ultra Pet Micro Pearls because they claim is sticks to the rake but I have not found that to be true on my model of the ScoopFree automatic litter box and you can always get the Ultra Pet Original Pearls that are larger to prevent caking on the rake if this is a problem.

When the ""Health Counter"" reaches about 120 on the ScoopFree machine you know to change the litter assuming your cat urinates the normal amount of 4 times a day. The ScoopFree can run about a week before you have to empty out the poop compartment which is great if you have a busy job. Bottom line: you get what you pay for when you buy a quality crystal litter like Ultra Pet Pearl Micro Crystal since it seems to last longer on my machine because the smaller crystals with greater surface area seem to absorb more urine and moisture.

Post Script: I have continued using the ScoopFree automatic litter box using Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals and a standard litter box using clumping clay litter for my one cat as recommended by the ASPCA, e.g. a backup litter box. My cat, over time, now uses the ScoopFree machine with the Ultra Pet Micro MUCH MORE than the standard litter box with clumping clay litter box. It appears that my cat now prefers the Ultra Pet Pearl Micro to that of standard clumping litter which totally amazed me.

Finally, my cat in the summer time seems to pee in greater volumes causing the Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals to get used up sooner. If the health counter reaches 90 in the summer, the Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals turn green, or the cat seems to stop using the automatic litter box then change the spent crystal litter with fresh Ultra Pet Litter Pearl Micro Crystals.",5
"I bought the mediums. Perfect size and shape for my little dog and my big dog. They bounce great for fetch. This toy is not an abnoxious squeak at every touch, only when the dog bites it. Durable, safe and fun.",5
"I bought this for my two Pomerania puppies, but only one of them was interested with the chicken flavor. And after two day, the one who ate the chew bone unfortunately were puked. The veterinarian said, it might because of the chew bone was too hard for little puppies who have sensitive stomach. So I would not recommended to little puppies.

ONG!!! After a couple of weeks ago, this item has been recalled due to Salmonella. I think that is why my poor puppy had been puked. That's really unacceptable and disappoint!",1
"I noticed a difference in my water clarity the day after using this. I have a 75 gallon tank and while the water was not cloudy I felt it could be clearer. I  place this in the top tray of a canister filter and the next day the water was noticeably improved.

On advice from Seachem I placed this product in the filter after my Matrix (biological filtration). While they usually recommend placing this before the biological filtration ( for fish only or lightly planted) for a heavily planted tank they recommend after the biological media. The reasoning is that Purigen will remove organic waste from the water before it gets to the biological media and that will lower the production of nitrate as the bacteria won't have as much raw material to turn into nitrate. For a planted tank you want a certain amount of nitrate so you place it after the biological media so the nitrate still gets produced. Even so, it does seem to lower nitrate production even in the biological media > Purigen order as my nitrates dropped from 10 ppm to 5 ppm the day after I installed this. Makes sense as it won't remove all of the organic waste from the water still leaving some raw material.

Make sure if you get the loose Purigen that you also get 'the bag'. This stuff is super fine and any standard bag for media will not hold it. The bag that Seachem sells is super fine and made just for this media. A different bag will not hold it.

In one day it cleared my water and dropped my nitrates. Did everything it said it would. What more can you ask.",5
"It is nice to see they have finally dropped the price of this product to be cheaper than the 8lb jug per pound.

Though this is still pricey it is concrete safe. I have a dog now and cats are constantly walking on my driveway and it does not seem to hurt them or irritate them. Also my dog licks the snow off his paws when he comes in so I don't want him eating something toxic. This is not toxic thankfully.

It is a bright blue color so it is easy to see where you have put it. I use the scott's seed spreader to spread this stuff evenly. Seeing as how it is fairly expensive I don't want to waste any so it the spreader is nice to give it an even coat.

It still effective at -2F

Living in the northeast this salt has gone through many snow storms very effectively. It will usually last up two days at full strength and starts to be less effective after that.",5
"Using it on my dogs, rabbits and myself. This stuff is beyond wonderful. If I had to go back in time, I would take this with me! The girl who sold it to me uses it on her face for acne (works!), the owner used it on a tooth infection (her pain went away and gave her a break until she could get to the dentist). My bunnies have snuffles and I've been spraying it in the air by their nose. They are getting better. My dog had a wound that healed up overnight after I sprayed it.  I can't say enough about it. Buy it and keep it on hand always. We need to support these guys and keep them in business forever and ever.",5
I like this so much better than the flak food.  I use EHEIM automatic feeders and these are a uniform size so they give almost the same amount on each feeding.  I would definitely recommend this and I have been keeping aquariums for 41 years.,5
"Good quality at a very reasonable price. Washes well. I took the chance of drying it on medium and the stitching puckered, so I would recommend line drying.",5
"I love it and my dog reaaaaly loves it; but the sound box inside is easily damaged.  My dog is a 40lb Aussie/Shar-Pei mix and destroys the sound box in a few minutes.  He still loves to chase it without the sound though.  I've purchased two of these so far and am going to purchase another one as the rubber band sling just broke off the second one.  Just a note: This toy is white, so I would suggest it to just be an inside toy since it can't be thrown into the wash due to the sound box inside and the rubber band sling shot part.",5
"My fur babies get their kibbles fix by eating these dental treats. I only feed my babies canned food,
but I can give them these dental treats and clean their teeth at the same time!",5
"I purchased 3 of these because they are supposed to fit dachshunds well. (And I want to say that they DO fit doxies great) my problem is that they build up so much static electricity so quickly that my poor dog won't move if one is on him. He gets shocked constantly and is now terrified to wear anything. These look nice but are very pricey and given the static issue, it was a complete waste of about $85. Very disappointing.",2
My dog loves this awesome,5
"My GSD puppy LOVES this ball!! It squeaks too, she runs around with it all of the time! GREAT TOY!",5
It's kinda small. Good for a kitten but not an adult cat.,2
Well made,5
Love the adjustability and it's perfect for my doggy.,5
fell apart within a day,1
Way to go treats way to get my dog's teeth clean,5
great product for small dogs. Verstile. I can put all 4 of mine (12lbs and under) in it. They can SOMETIMES escape...if the top is not on. Great for puppies.,5
Food OK. Cats not enthusiastic.,3
"When I read the description of the product, I thought these were actual bones, they are not...they are somewhat soft and only slightly crunchy when the dog ate them. My lab mix ate it in about 1 minute. I was hoping they would occupy her a bit longer.",3
"I couldn't wait to play with my cat after I got this toy. Well, he IS interested, but I AM worried. The rolled cardboard pieces are pretty stiff, so when the cat runs after it and inevitably crashes into it, I feel as if I were constantly about to poke his eyes (it did hit his face numerous times due to the unpredictable bobbing motion of the wire). The end of the wire is also exposed, and since I need to let my cat ""win"" from time to time, once he catches it, he will chew on it, and it's potentially dangerous (what if the cardboard piece comes loose and the wire end becomes a hook?!!). In addition, since the wire is not long enough, I can't comfortably stand up and play with the cat (I am 5'3"" and have to stoop a little when I need to drag it around the floor). A good concept, but I find the flying feather stuff much more to my liking, and much safer.",3
Our Rats love it.,5
Seems to work. Worth a try.,4
Have small dogs so I put bone in microwave for 10 seconds and they soften up to cut into chewable pieces.  When cool they get hard again.  Great product that is helthy for dogs.,5
good item  quality,5
I have two cats...they both love this bed...it's never empty.,5
Too big for my two Maltese dogs but is great for removing tangles.,5
Makes a pool of liquid at the bottom of pan. Cat does not like using it.,2

I bought this bowl and the lime green one as well.  My dogs needed new bowls and I was excited to get them.  I ship to my address in USA then my husband brings them to me in Mexico.  So returns are almost impossible unless I am in USA.  Well first the bowls were smaller than expected, okay I can deal with that.  Washed them and then changed my dogs bowls.  The Lime Green bowl went over better than the gold of which the dogs would not eat out of at all.  The Lime one yes but hesitantly.  How strange.  I rewashed them etc.  This went on for a few days.  Thought maybe the dog who would not eat out of either bowl was sick , so changed back to original bowls and made vet appt.  Dog ate all his food.  Weird.  I gave the bowls to my mother who also has two dogs, much to our chagrin her dogs would not eat out of the gold bowl either and only with hesitation out of the lime green bowl.  So thus has to be something wrong with the bowls.  All the dogs are good eaters.  I wanted to donate to shelter but am afraid as if dog does not eat as well maybe will be euthanized as sick when is just the bowl, so I have to throw them in the trash.  Not right.  I would like a full refund of my purchase price. I also ask that you research these bowls as obviously something is wrong.

Sent email to Amazon regarding these bowls and with the fantastic customer satisfaction they have they refunded my money for these bowls and I threw them out.  I am sad about the bowls as they were so cute but very happy with Amazon's service and customer satisfaction policies.  Will continue to do most of my shopping via Amazon!!!",1
"I use Aqueon QuietFlow before I switch to Maineland Emperor recommended by the local pet shop. My old Aqueon QuietFlow is very very quiet you can't hardly hear the water flowing through. But till I got into a much bigger tank. I need bigger filtration system.

This system done a great job to keeping the water clear, there is 2 stages filtering and a Bio wheel. The first one is a filter cartridge and second one is optional. The system comes with a tray for additional filter media. I add Diamond Blend to remove toxic ammonia and chloramines, also can dissolve waste and odors. The water are clear and in good condition all the time.
Bio wheel, I really don't know what's that for? But it created a very nice ZEN feel water flow noise.
The noise level is much higher than the Aqueon product. My tank is locate at my living room about 35 ft away from my bedroom at 2nd floor. And I can still hear the water flow at night, but somehow the water flow sounds very peaceful and nature. I feel like I am camping near by the river everyday LOL. I like it a lot!

For people don't like water flow or dripping noise, you may think about it!",5
The collars don't fit either of my dogs. Its not a good system either. I haven't been able to successfully use it once. Waste of money. Wish i could return.,2
Cats won't touch this food got it for good reviews have 4 cats not 1 will eat it.,1
"Cute , dogs love",5
thanks cat loves it,5
My heavy chewing lab mix  year old loved this toy.  It didn't really hold up as well as I had hoped though.  In just a week or so she had it down to a size that I had to throw away the rest to be safe.  Might be great for a lesser chewer.,3
Way smaller than described.  Poor quality.,2
Doesnt' work like I thought it would. Dogs can tip it over and move it. Would be nice to be weighted down.,3
"Great product.  However, one of the bags was split on receipt.  That doesn't mean I won't use it or recommend it.",4
"The Cat Mate Locking Cat Door is excellent - all of our cats readily use the door to go in and out of the house.

Tip: This door is really meant to be used for doors, not walls. I remember seeing an extension kit or something along those lines, but if you're handy, you really don't need anything like that. You can build your own extension in the wall and still use the cat door, which is what we did.",5
"Didn't see a difference and I'm not happy with all the ingredients. Finally found a product that worked, it's called Longevity and is sold by Springtime,inc.",2
This plant arrived in great condition and was of a great size. It's doing very well in my new tank.,5
"Freeplay's Multisak Dog Organizer will undoubtedly be better received than this reviewer has.  It is a very compact item that neatly fits all the things you may need for a dog outing, but maybe my review will provide some second thoughts from people who are more like me.

There are many compartments.  Both the attached cardboard instructions and the paper instructions are simple and complete and show what it holds and how to use its features.  An inside portion has slots for santizer, a cell phone, and a roll of waste bags with a slot to pull and tear them off and out.

A separate part has an attachment for a leash, and a middle portion can hold a collapsible dog dish for water and there's room to spare for treats.

As nifty and compact as this product is, it has subjective drawbacks that may be conditional because of me:  The attachment doesn't fit my leash (but it in all fairness it can attach to my belt loop), and it doesn't have the size and sturdiness for my large dog.  (The retractable dog leashes I've seen in the store would be compatible for small dogs and look the same size and strength as small dog leashes.)  My $1.00 sanitizer bottle is far too big for the designated slot, and my economical roll of 100 four-gallon bags don't fit or dispense well.

It is nice to have my roll of bags in the center portion of the bag, and I can, otherwise, keep my sanitizer in a less snug place.  I'm sure it is easy to find the designated items to fit this pack neatly, which would take from me more time and money.

It's a good idea, and I'm sure many terrier (e.g., et al) owners will be rightly enthralled with this practical item (which fits neatly in one's pocket or purse), but I found it as conditionally less to like.",3
If you have a cat that likes Fancy Feast and you want your mornings peaceful.  This is how to buy your Fancy Feast.,5
My Poodle likes this toy!,5
"I bought this kit because it says right on the label that it tests for iron bacteria.  Since I wanted to test my well water for that in particular, I bought this kit, only to discover after opening it that the ""test"" is not a test at all; the instructions tell you to look at the color of the water and any rings in the toilet tank.  Duh!  The same kind of ""test"" applies to the hydrogen sulfide it is supposed to identify: smell your water.  This company should be forced to take these claims off their label since they use them to distinguish their product from their competitors'.  I returned this kit faster than you can say, ""False advertising!""

I've used Pro-Lab strips before, and they are fairly easy to use.  The kit contains two strips for each test to allow you to recheck your results in a month or so.  The problem is that most people who have well water want to test for bacteria (both iron and not) and pesticides, neither of which gets readings from this kit.  It does test nitrites and nitrates, which come from fertilizer and animal waste run-off, but testing for those is not nearly as ""complete"" a water test as the manufacturer wants you to believe.

I recommend that consumers look to other brands.

-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1
"I read other reviews where people some people said their dogs loved it, and others that their dogs hated it due to the strong smell.  I bought it as I have a dog fighting cancer, and, unfortunately, he will not eat food when I put this on it.  I suggest anyone who tries it start with the small size and not the 5 lbs. one like I did.",3
"If you don't mind changing out the whole litter box every 3-4 days, then this litter is great. I scoop daily, if not more. And I thought it was great at first.. But this litter smells atrocious after only a few days, with the stench lingering in the entire bathroom that can't be stopped with sprays, Lysol, candles, anything except changing out all the litter. I don't want to have to change the whole box every few days. I'll stick with regular litter, it lasts at least one week without making the paint on my bathroom walls peel. This wheat litter also gets everywhere worse than regular litter. My cat always drags some out of the box, but this wheat litter is covering my whole bathroom floor and then some.",1
"I had my 8wk old Sheepadoodle for almost a week before I gave in to buy this $30 toy. Best $30 I've ever spent. She went from waking up 6-7 times a night to go to the bathroom to just three times the first night, then ZERO times the second night. She did start biting it at first, but then stopped and fell asleep. Now she bites it for a minute every time before she falls asleep but it's not a problem. LIFE SAVER!",5
"We used this to train our 6 month old kitten... Its been pretty hard and we are having to start from square one again, I think we may have moved her along too quick. At first it was great, she went right on the toilet and went to the bathroom. We gave her treats and praise and felt good about the training. As some time went by and we began to take out rings she started using other places in our house to go to the bathroom. She often times would miss and her ""stuff"" would be all over the toilet seat. We have kept trying and she is still not getting it... The final straw was when she went all over my laundry! I had it... so I put the litter box back. She ran into it so quick and peed for what seemed like the longest time I have ever seen a cat go! She must have really been holding it in, poor thing! I want to try again and see if I can make this work but I am unsure of if I am torturing my cat or not...",3
"I am so glad I bought this set. It makes picking up and disposing of doggy lawn bombs super easy! No more bending over, smearing, or struggling to balance more than one turd on a shovel. The rake is the perfect size and is surprisingly efficient at grabbing its target out of the grass and scooping it into the pan. The pan is easy to carry, even with a few days or more full of waste. The set makes this chore so quick and easy.",5
cats love them!!,5
"My dog goes wild for these. She loves every flavor. I like that they are small - good for training and easy to throw in a pocket. Plus, because they are all natural, they actually smell good, so I don't mind bringing them along.",5
A great product - effective and efficient delivery.,5
door to get into is to small,3
What a bargain! These are thick strips that our dogs love. They make me salivate!!,5
"Might work for others but my pup hates wearing it. I think the chest piece rubs the inside of her front legs/doggie armpits. She walks funny when she wears it. She's a whippet and something mix, she's about 25lbs. So it could definitely be better for other breeds!",2
"Tough to put together.  After 45 min. of trying, I looked it up online.  Found this really helpful, a Video of putting it together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42E13pGZN3c  The door is still a bit tight, hoping it will loosen with use. Great size for my 13 lb Parson Russell Terrier, and so light weight to carry through the dog show to a set up.",4
"Too many sticks! My cats like this to the point they like to eat what is sprinkled, but I have to carefully go through and pick out the hard sticks so that they don't pierce my cats' throats and make them choke.",2
holds temp,5
This kennel is very spacious and roomy for my German shorthair who is only 40 pounds and very petite. She did tear up the bottom pad but I kjust replaced it with a blanket. EXTREMELY EASY TO SET UP. It took me less than 30 seconds to set this kennel up and I use it daily.,5
"My mom has a small dog (mutt) who likes to play. We only buy her red Kong toy so we can find it under beds, sofas etc. I find it a nice toy it bounces violently sometimes so be careful around the TV. Although she prefers throw and thug games more. So I guess it depends on the personal preference of your dog 'child'. Hope that helps.",5
Perfect size for our English bulldog.,5
"I bought two of these to hold dog chewies and dog treats.  Cute and smart looking for on top of kitchen counter.  Easy to access the treats, keeps them fresh, easy to clean.  Makes me look organized!",5
"I prefer to mix up the chow for my dogs occasionally, and I like the Natural Balance products, so I ordered this one to see how it compares. I find it to have a good analysis and to be liked by the dogs, but to be very rich for their digestion.

I have tried several of these products (most recently the Venison and Sweet Potato), and they have all been fine. This one, however, resulted in very loose stools for the dogs, even after finishing off the entire bag. I have small dogs, so this was a three week run even with the smallest size bag. Otherwise it appears fine - the dogs were energetic and happy. Looking at the ingredient list, I'm not sure I would want that many supplements for my dogs over time. It is also rather expensive (maybe not a big surprise for a duck recipe).

Summary: The dogs liked it, but I did not like cleaning up after them. Recommended only if your breed can handle a rich diet.

"This is obviously better than your traditional, clear e-collar. It still throws off their balance and depth perception a little, but at least our dog could rest comfortably on it since the foam conforms to however she rests her head.

The inside is black, and any dirt or slobber spots from drinking water, drooling, etc. can be wiped off with a baby wipe very easily.",4
So far so good.  I had a similar Hamic before but I like the pockets and this one and the material looks thick and durable as well. Thumbs up,5
"I liked the way this scooped, but my previously-angelic cats revolted and peed all up in my house! I think it was the smell. It was strong.",1
So far..it is holding up well.  The other one kept getting moisture and quit.,5
Got it as a spare.,5
"Great product, easy to adjust to your car or truck, stays put and works great!",4
"These are great filters, it's nice that they come in a multi pack. Easy to switch out the old one and replace it with a new. Filter seems to capture a lot of the gunk and fish poo; keeps the tank pretty clean. I usually replace each month so this multi pack it cost effective compared to buying them at the local or chain stores.",5
Only one of my cats showed any interest in this and that waned after about 15 minutes.,2
My dogs love these!,5
Great quality and protects my truck seat very well! Only thing that would make it better is if it had a slot for the center seatbelt.,5
My dogs won't eat them. Too bad bc the ingredients are great.,1
The sizes run small. Get a bigger size than normal. I got a medium for my miniature dachshund and it fit him tightly.,3
I gave this to my cats for dinner...They are not into it...they will eat their crunchies around it...I gave it 4 star because it looks like good food...I just think they are not into the flavor ....,4
"I am happy with the packaging of this product.  As shown in my photo, the container is larger than a 1 quart saucepan. (For scale).  The treats are close in size to a nickel but thicker about 1/2-3/4 inch.  For small dogs, they are easily broken into small pieces.  Since my dogs have been taking a different hip treat, I will keep them on the maintenance dose.  These treat have a higher amount of glucosamine than the others out there.  The dogs are picky eaters and had no hesitation with gobbling these down. Other reviewers have complained about the odor but I didn't notice and I have been told I'm sensitive to smells.  When I saw the price of this product, I didn't stop to consider that the jar contains 120 treats.  I paid $15.00 for much less of the other product at the big box pet supply stores.  So all things considered this is a bargain and with small dogs will last a very long time.  I wish they sold a smaller amount as we live on a budget. By the way I know  the Nootie brand and have some other treats from them.  Good stuff!!!  Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",4
"It took me a while to know how to used it because my baby is a mix of Border Collie and Beagle, but only have from her beagle dad the size. So I was trying to get a video to show me how to use in a long hair dog.
After a few times (the first time my baby ended up with a few holes lol), it was amazing how good the scissors are. I also have a tny trim from them and is very good for clean-up the privates areas, paws.

I will recommend it, it may be easier for you, all come with the practice.",5
"These arrived with many of the tablets smashed into powder so they are not usable. I plan to look into other options to fertilize my pond plants.
Against my better judgement, I ordered them again since couldn't find them at my local garden center. This time they arrived intact.",3
"I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection.

Go the old fashioned way, with a tray and a liner!",1
"Pupper loved it, but tore it up quickly. He's a Scottie, so 23 lbs. but this didn't last. Their hard soccer type ball is much better for hard chewers.",4
Seller was very helpful but all but two shrimp died within 3 weeks. Ordered 20 replacement (non-Sakura) red cherry shrimp elsewhere and all are doing well.,3
cute,5
good enough,3
Works awesome!,5
"These came crazy fast and are as described. Unfortunately they don't stick well to my woven couches and I keep getting them stuck to me before I can get them on the couch, or I forget they're there and they stick to my elbow and rip off then crinkle up. I've pretty much blown through them because of these reasons. I probably should have saved the $20 and used packing tape. I think these would be better if the sticky was only on one side.",4
Great product fast delivery.,5
"dogs liked it, but I started to notice sharp little strands were they had been chewing - I have one who has strong jaws and teeth, so she may have been shredding it, so took it away so they would not choke on them.  the Havanese seemed to bleed in her mouth when using it.  Not so sure its for small dogs like mine",4
I bought this for my young cat who gulps his food down too quickly and then throws up.  It got so bad that the vet said his teeth were rotting (he was only 10 months!) This bowl works 100% it allows him to pace himself while eating and he does not throw up any more which is fantastic. I only use dry food in this have never tried putting wet food in here. I often wash it in the dishwasher and so far no problems! The great thing about this bowl is how it looks - not an eyesore in the kitchen!,5
"easy to assemble, kitties love it but it gets a little unsteady after use. I have had it for maybe 8 months and one of the stands keeps shaking even after tightening it.",3
My dogs -German Shepard (3yo) and Pomeranian (12yo) love it !,5
I really thought my puppy or older dogs would play with this but they all ignore it. Don't know why.  It is made well and should be a great tug toy.  So I am only rating it according to my own experience. do not assume your dogs will play with it.,3
They were a little smaller than I expected but they made a great addition to my little Betta cube tank.,4
My cats inhale these treats and the size was convenient!,5
"Got this for my rat terrier/chihuahua mix that is about 11.4 pounds. Overall the product is made nicely and fits him well. The only thing I don't like is that it falls forward when he sits in it. Not enough for him to fall out or anything, just slightly leans forward off of your body, no matter how much you adjust the straps. But, I do use mine almost everyday to keep him with me and keep my hands free. Overall this was definitely a good buy.",4
"Looked adjustable nylon harness, I love!",5
"The bowls work great so far. They easily latch onto your walking leash. However, the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it has a HEAVY odor to it, even after you wash it for the first time. I don't know what chemicals are used to make it, my only hope is this isn't harmful in anyway.
But the product is convenient and works as intended. Keep in mind, these bowls aren't made to feed your dog, they are made to make it easy on them to pour them some quick water or food while you are out on a long walk or hike. If you use them that way, they will be fine.",4
"When you don't want a heavy, cheesy pizza!",4
"My cat absolutely hated me for a few hours, but I think it was worth it. His ears are much better, now.",4
Exactly as it is described.,4
"Glasses are nice, but my dog kept pulling them off..had to return them",5
"Awesome.  Clumps well and keeps odor at bay.  Fine grain as well, so it seems to make less of a visible mess.",5
This is the best ball around for your dog. I bought one and then went back to order three additional. My puppy has so much fun playing and chasing her squeaky ball around. Great entertainment for any dog!,5
"soft, no grain, tasty.  my dog does all her tricks when I have these out.  however, she won't do them without the treats!  ha ha.",5
"OK....did my dog like these???  Yes!  Did I feel they were a healthy option for her?  No.  Honestly, unless I was home with her I would not give these to her.  I am concerned about choking or that a hard piece from the outer treat will be a problem.  These may help digestively, I don't know but when I am choosing to feed my dog Wellness Core why would I give her treats that were not of the same quality?  Dog nutrition is the most important things for your pet.  If I could afford to feed raw I would but since I can't I do my best to find high quality dog treats that I know will benefit my dog.",2
"My vet retired and sold her practice to another vet. The new vet charged me $14.42 for a 3 oz. bottle of Chlorhexidine. I bought this Gallon  for $18.
It is great for skin problems on dogs, cats or horses. Helps them heal very fast and seems to stop the irritation that causes them lick or bite the wound. Great for 'hot spots'. Shave hair off and apply this liquid twice a day, you will be amazed.  (By the way I have found a new vet.)",5
"Add a small Hydor evo pump, wrap outside with foil or paint it, throw some chaeto and macroalgae into the box and this is way better than spending more $ on an aquaclear AC110 and have to mod the propeller etc. No major mod is required on this, there is more space, and the top is clear for your lights. Most of all, it's sturdy and cheap!",5
great,5
"Everything is comparative.  Previous to getting this PetSafe Healthy Pet Water and Food Station  (I haven't figured out how to use it as a food station), I've had two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Petmate-waterers/dp/B000NJJJ32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Petmate waterers</a>&nbsp;set out for four cats.  Ironically, it wasn't until I started writing this review that I noticed these Petmate waterers were ""... ideal for short term automatic watering applications.""  Since I've used them for years, I'm not sure what that means!  HOWEVER, these older Petmate waterers do get a build-up of hard water deposits (and associated scum) that require vigorous cleaning at times, even with vinegar added to dissolve those deposits.

This PetSafe Healthy Pet Water Station is advertised as easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I like the removable stainless steel bowl. and it fits easily in a space that a normal soup bowl would take up in a dishwasher.  And you don't even need a dishwasher!  It is easily hand washed and air-dried.  The whole filter thing, to me, is overkill, but then my culinary water is very good.  I won't replace it, but the waterer should still work.  The water holding unit installs without spilling water.

All in all, a nice unit.  The water seems to disappear faster than with the older Petmate waterers, but there's more surface area of the water exposed, so this could be due to evaporation.",4
"My 2 Dachsie puppies go nuts for these. Sadly, I can't use these treats in my treat pouch because they crumble very quickly and easily. But, so none of the goodies go to waste,  I save the crumblies to sprinkle on their kibble.",5
Very cute and nice,5
"The dogs will chew on them for a while, but seem to lose interest quickly...",2
"I don't necessarily have this exact one, but I do like them.  Mine are now 7 years old and yes the rubber thing did fall off but I put electrical tape around the base to keep it on and it looks okay.  My problem now is the paint is coming off.  But after 7 years maybe that is to be expected?  They're not bad...",3
Cute little costume. It fit as described and we got many compliments while tricker treating on Halloween.,5
"Wonderful product,  my dogs love it.  The small bites are perfect for their little mouths.",5
RECOMMENDED TO ME FOR MY DOG AND SHE LOVES IT.,5
This is a cat food my aging cat loved. And then you add the convenience of the great Amazon delivery service I couldn't beat it. For non drivers Amazon can be a lifesaver. My 17 year old cat was so happy to be fed this her last month of life. And as pet parents well know anything that makes them happy makes us happy.,5
"My dog wouldnt have it. She didn't like it much better than the cone. Somehow tore it off her head withing 10 minutes. Luckily she didn't show any interest in her incision and we just never used it again. However I can see this working for more tolerant dogs. Its not as restrictive as a cone and much more comfortable.  Depending on where the problem area is, this could be rendered useless because they can reach a lot more of their body.",4
I use this in my media basket within my saltwater tank. Works great and doesn't fall apart.,5
"This cage is only a five-star for me after some significant modifications. Here's a break-down:

Structure: Good enough. No problems getting around for my Syrian, BUT she does like to climb. The gap to the bottom level could be worrying for her to fall through (which she has several times over). She always comes away fine--the distance from the top of the cage to the lower ground isn't much--but I'd maybe be cautious with smaller hamster breeds who like to climb and inevitably drop down. Also not a lot of space for bedding at the bottom level without impeding something else.

Size: A little too small for my taste. It would be perfect for a smaller hamster breed maybe, but for my Syrian it was a little too cramped. That's part of where her climbing issue came from I suspect. I've fixed this issue myself by adding my own make-shift ""bin cage""--connected via a plastic tube made for ferrets shoved through the square opening intended for the Ferplast's already included tube connector; I will include pictures of this. Personally, the price was not worth having to turn around and buy something else to add on and make it adequate. (I realize I could have made a ""bin cage"" from the get-go but I preferred the look of hamster cage, initially, which is why I purchased the Ferplast).

Included Attachments/Components: This aspect needed the most modification. The wheel and water bottle are waaay too small; I threw them out immediately and replaced them. The size of the wheel is especially important for a Syrian hamster, as one that is too small could damage their spines. The little hideaway I worried was too small as well, but she uses it to sleep in sometimes. We'll see how things are when she gets to be full-sized. The food dish was perfect, no cons there.

Added Note: The bars of this cage are ""chew-proof"". So far, after a month+ of use, the bars are all intact BUT after a good while of chewing they will show some wear. And black colored dust will have fallen on some parts of my desk where I keep my hamster, from where she chews the bars.

Overall a decent cage, biggest con is that it's a little too small for my Syrian and half of the included items were replaced immediately.",3

My Review for SMALL DOGS Triple Pet Toothbrush:
Wow. I'm so shocked to read the negative reviews on this ""small"" dog toothbrush. ??? I absolutely LOVE this 3-headed toothbrush!

My breed = Shih Tzu (aka, a Toy Breed Dog. She's small. Maybe NOT as tiny as a Maltese, Chihuahua, or a Yorkie, but she's still a SMALL dog with a SMALL mouth, yet this brush is tiny enough to easily fit inside her mouth. To be fair, she's on the upper range of her Breed Standard (11"" at the withers), so she's slightly slightly smaller than a Lhasa, and a tad larger than the avg Shih Tzu. Nevertheless, if you have a Shih Tzu or larger dog, I can't see that this brush would be too big. JMO.

Ok, so does my dog LOVE having her teeth brushed?
Answer = are you serious? lol NO!
Of course it's not in her top 1,000,000 things to have done. This, despite having her teeth brushed every other day since she was 10 WEEKS old. She's now 11 yo, and her teeth are GLEAMING. So, despite her Academy Award worthy antics at teeth brushing time, this brush rates an A+++++ with me. The proof that this toothbrush works is in her vet comments about how her teeth are tartar-free! Since using this toothbrush, I no longer have to use a scaler on her teeth anymore. :)  She doesn't really fight me while I brush, BUT she does ""wiggle"". lol And she likes to CHOMP down on the brush. THAT is the scary part. Shih Tzus are said to have ""crystal jaws"", ie, as in they are VERY fragile. And I did not like using the standard type brushes lwith the HARD plastic handles for just that reason. It was a struggle every time to hold her mouth open with my fingers -- gently, yet firmly -- while I also tried to brush her teeth. Around 4 years ago (maybe 3?) we saw the Triple Pet EZ Dog brush at a store. We've never looked at any other brush since. This brush makes brushing EFFECTIVE, and MUCH easier! I actually have put her chomping action to good use -- she helps to clean her own molars that way. :) She doesn't bit down HARD (I'd never allow that), but I do let her gently gnaw on the brush a tiny bit. The FLEXIBLE toothbrush head allows for the brush to move/sway/bend as she gnaws. Does this mean you can let your dog chomp down HARD and they won't hurt their jaw? NO. I'd say do not let them chomp down hard if you have a small breed known to have fragile jaw bones. I know a very few Tzu owners who allow their dogs to chew RAW bones, but I'm not one of them. The same can be said for this toothbrush -- use common sense, but at least this brush offers a bit more safety than the harder handle brushes, imho!

I also love the ergonomic grip handle on this brush. I'm not sure if it's rubber or silicon; all I know is that it's comfy to grip, and that matters when you have carpal tunnel occasional flair ups as I have!

Btw, the bristles on this brush head DO soften up over time, as would any other toothbrush. I read a comment somewhere saying that the bristles were too stiff? I did not find them too stiff, but if so, just use less pressure when brushing. Over time, the bristles will soften. Once you start to see the bristles fray, it's time for a new brush! My original brush lasted almost 2 years before it began fraying.

NOTE ON TOOTHPASTE:
I do use the Triple Pet Toothpaste, but read that someone didn't like it because it contained ""sorbitol"". I do not use that much toothpaste on the brush to where I think it would really matter, and I DO rinse the toothbrush off with water and go over my furbaby's teeth again for the final brush. However, if you are worried about sorbitol, another good ""natural"" toothpaste is the ""KISSABLE"" doggie toothpaste brand. That one contains only STEVIA as a sweetner. I ALT between both toothpaste brands. Kissable products also has a 3-headed brush, but I have not tried it; therefore I cannot comment on how effective it is. Design-wise, just from what I have seen, I much prefer the Triple Pet one, as the Triple Pet seems much more flexible in the head design.

____

I hope my review will help other small breed dog owners to decide on whether or not this toothbrush would suit their pup. I DO agree that Triple Pet should come up with a smaller sized toothbrush, BUT they shouldn't change the ""SMALL"". They should leave this brush as is, and simply add an ""X-SMALL"" to their line up for the teeny-tiny furbabies. You can contact the company at their new Fetch4Pets web site and suggest an X-SMALL if you have a tiny dog. :)

***NOTE: My dog is fed a 100% homecooked diet (has been for the past 9 yrs), and I do brush her teeth every day or at least every OTHER day. I also use a homeopathic remedy to keep tartar at bay (Fragaria Vesca -- 3 pellets dissolved in 2 oz distilled water, and brush on teeth 1 x week). While I LOVE this particular toothbrush and find it emmensely effective at cleaning her teeth, I really do feel that her superior dental health results are due to ALL of the above.***",5
Cats love it great scratching. Pad,5
These work great for poor pups going through a crisis.  Have several on hand now just in case.  I would never use the hard plastic ones again.,5
Many plant pieces,3
"as described
great price",4
Our 2 boy cats love this stuff and this is cheaper than buying it at the grocery store.,5
My dog is terrified of it.,1
My dogs love them. Chewy and smell good. Made in America. Quality is assured.,5
My mini schnauzer loves it so therefore i love it.,5
"The bag design is very nice! I'm glad I chose the large size for my 8 lb kitty. There is enough space for my cat to stand up, comfortably lay on his side, or carefully turn around if he wants to. I wouldn't go any smaller unless I absolutely had to.
The fabric quality is thinner than I'd hoped it would be. I suspect this carrier's durability is more aimed toward 'special occasions' than frequent outings. That said, it seems good for the price and I'm happy with my purchase.
There is a slight plastic-y smell at first, but that is quickly dissipating (after about 15 hours).",4
Great value and love to have it on hand whenever walking my dog!,5
"Looks like great quality so far. Came fast and all the info was correct. It is not engraved, but printed onto the tag. Still a good deal compared to the pet store machines!",4
Feels like it could break with my large dog and it desperately needs anti-skid on the bottom.,2
"Perfect size for travel!! At home, I use the regular sized cans, but when me and pup are on the go, it's great to have these on hand. Each can contains one single serving with a pop-top lid. My dog found all the flavors delicious.",5
Great product that clumps firmly and removes most of the odors. I've been lugging it home myself for the same price or more plus Amazon will ship it free.,5
wonderful product.,5
Works wonderfully for my shrimp tanks,5
"Not sized as stated, was able to return without issue",1
My dog enjoys this treat...and it keeps her busy for a bit since it's chewy.,5
"I bought this little tree for my fish tank, only problem is... It turned out to be not so little...
I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to where it says it's almost a foot tall.  It is
nice though!  I kept it and put it on my window sill.",5
"This product works on my dogs, and the price is cheaper compared to Frontline Top Spot!  You can't beat that!",5
"Love the size, do not like the plastic borders as it causes pee to run out and under pee pad. My senior Yorkie tends too pee close to border. One solution is to cut borders off, but I don't have time to do that all the time. A shame since they are inexpensive and absorbent.",4
"Bought this cage for a parrot to replace one that was old and dirty, and it's perfect!
Big enough to hold at least two large birds and a few little ones.
The tray at the bottom is generally easy to detach from the top of the cage to be emptied and cleaned.
One big problem we'd had with our old cage was that the food dish was at the edge of the cage in the front, where our parrot would eat and then proceed to push a lot of seeds out onto the floor below. The place of the dishes in this cage are discreet and low enough in the cage that no seeds escape and they all land in the tray below. Changing out food and water is easy with the little doors that go right to them.
Another problem with our old cage was how easy it was for our parrot to escape. We usually had to zip-tie the doors. This cage has actual locks on it and he has no way to escape when we need him inside.
Awesome product, recommend to anyone. :)",5
"Makes such a difference on our walks and her awareness of me. She used to jump and bark at every dog we walked by, with this collar, she doesn't react nearly as much (took about a week of wearing it to get there). My dog isn't a huge fan of it, but it could be the bright pink that I got her. next time I would get one close to the color of her nose so she can't see it as much (hindsight is 20/20).",5
The first pic is my 4 month old 5.25 lb kitten with the new scratch post. I have no other pets & no children.the other pics are 24 hours later. Take a look and you can decide if you think this is a good product!,1
"I'd say these are more of ""treats"" than ""chews"" based on how quick our vizsla's devour them.. they crunch right through these things within a matter of seconds.  A decent value for the quantity you get.",4
"When my cats were 'teenagers' they disliked this chicken & tuna mix. Now as adults they love it. They enjoy all of the Purina Pro Plan Wet Cat Foods.
Update 4/15  Sadly Amazon has dropped this from their Subscribe & Save program.",5
"My king charles cavalier, Pawla, loses her mind when I ask if she wants a Greenie. There was one time she did not eat one due to feeling sick... I was shoked. Great product!",5
Dog loves them. Clean his teeth well.,5
I recently bought a hamster for my daughter. The pet store was selling 27 liters for about $27.99. This is 30 liters for under $4. It is the same name brand as the store sells and the same quality. The hamster doesnt make much smell so I cant comment on that but the price is just fantastic. You really cant go wrong.,5
I have a 2 yr old black lab that is a destroyer of all stuffed toys and most every other toy he has ever been given.  He has had this Kong bone for a while now and has not made a dent in it.  We use it for fetch too.  Great toy for heavy chewers.,5
great treat for all my dogs,4
"When you need it to work and give the dog a warning, you stand there repeatedly hitting the button while the dog continues to misbehave.  Not reliable. I sent them back.",1
Exactly as described,5
"I got the bowls really quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.
The bowls have a good premium feel to it and the material seems to be very tough and reliable. My one only note is color. When I actually looked at the ""red"" bowl, it was more pink than it is red. It's hard to gauge color based on product images due to differences in monitor calibration, but this was really more pink than it is red and even the carabiner comes in a metallic pink color.
Not too happy about that but functionally, it is there.",4
"It was easy to assemble, my cats are coming around to it. I agree with other purchasers and will be flying the Velcro tabs down.",4
Great material and fits great !,4
My Great Pyrenees actually seemed worse after taking this,2
"Our 81 lb Labrador adores this toy. She has managed to detach the fringes on one side, but she has kept them and carries them in her mouth. They are the first thing she takes out of her toy box.  I have to order another one, since she is now working on the knotted part, and I will throw it away when she gets the strings unraveled.",5
Perfect little bowl for a smaller dog - nice that you can take out the insert and wash both pieces separately.,5
more than a mouth full good product,5
Brand new with tags and company won't take a return,1
YUK! It's really watery and my three animals will not eat it.,1
My dog loves these treats. Wanted to eat the whole bag.,5
"Purchased this for my 25 lb. Cocker Spaniel. The collar latch works fine; however, the lock that goes into your seat belt is absolutely no good if it clamps as mine does to my Honda CRV! ""Every time I tried to use it, no matter which side seatbelt I used, my dog would end up stepping on the seatbelt, causing it to release. It took no effort for this to happen repeatedly. So, if your buckle in the same position on the seat as mine, I can definitely not recommend this product.",2
"This is a great leash. Durable. I thought it would be more reflective; however, it is a bright green color. Would order again.",4
"My cat loves this, much better than just a regular water dish.",5
"These work perfect for transporting one gallon bottles. Holds bottles securely. If you are looking for a crate to transport gallon bottles, look no further.",5
My dog loves these and I cannot find them locally.  She particularly likes the large ones as she is a Staffy Bull and loves to play with toys that are not easily destroyed.  Pat,5
perfect,5
"Two gobbling Golden Retrievers have had their meals slowed way down! I highly recommend these dishes, a bit difficult to clean but worth it in potential lives saved!",5
"Great retractable leash. The longer length is enjoyed by our Shitzu when we go for walks. This has been our favorite leash. The previous one lasted many, many years, but finally started to fray and we were concerned it might pull apart when she was on leash, so we purchased a new one.",5
"I know you are thinking that $40 for a Cat Litter Mat is expensive, but it really works.",5
Good stuff.  Does a nice job of cleaning pet messes.  Great smell too.,5
My gerbils love this product,5
"I buy this anyway, it's a good price on its own, subscribe and save makes it even better. I have back issues so a lot easier to deal with on my front porch.",5
"I love IRIS products. I have a number of them and am always satisfied. I needed a larger container in order to fit a whole bag.
Used to be that dog food came in 50lb bags. They have diminished in quantity but not price, of course. So we now purchase bags now that weigh only 31.1lbs. I have no idea how much .1lb  is but it doesn't compensate for the 18.9lbs they've taken out! The only good aspect of this is that I probably can't carry 50lbs anymore...or maybe even the 40lbs size. However this is why the casters matter in my small apt.
It's not the item I'm removing the star from; it's the reviews. This is too big! I'm sure it fits 50lbs, but I really need a smaller size. Probably about  20% less. So if you're storing a bag weighing 35lbs, you don't need a 64qt or 67qt size.
I would return it but my boxes were recycled. The size limits my ability to find a box, pack and get it to UPS. At least it moves easily.",4
I love this product.  It works like a charm for my pack.  I don't overuse it and I'm sensitive to adverse reactions... and so I would say: in the hands of a responsible pet owner: GREAT product,5
I love this gentle shampoo. No problems on my ferrets. Not harsh. Very good product. Thank you.,5
"My fault, I bought the wrong thing! I thought I was buying beta food :(",1
"My mini schnauzer was having an awful outbreak of  ""schnauzer bumps"". I ordered the stripping knife and this shampoo. After using both only twice I can tell a big difference. This shampoo makes her hair feel silky and it smells good. I don't know if I need to use the stripping knife using this shampoo but her bumps were so bad, I did. I'm going to use it next time without the stripping knife. Very pleased with this shampoo.",5
These stainless steel thermometers are the most reliable for the price.  The numbering is large enough to see and you can determine temperature fairly quick.,5
fine,4
"We have a 14 year old terrier/Chihuahua 12lbs, fits perfectly in his size large seat.  This seat allows him to stand, sit, or lay down; he has the ability to see out of the car window.  There is a strap buckle in the seat that we use to buckle him in by his harness.  I would not recommend using this strap buckle for collar leashes, if they try to jump out this will cause them to hang and choke.  This seat states that it fits dogs up to 18lbs, my dog is 12lbs, large gives him more room, and a medium size would be a tight fit. This seat is very easy to assemble, mount and dismount in your car and light in weight.  I highly recommend this product for first time buyers of small dog car seats.",5
"My pets all love this!!  Cleaning is a once a year thing for me.  I think that mold growth is driven more by the quality of the water and the environment (temperature, humidity, etc.) .

Holds about a week of water for 2 cats and a big dog..",5
"I first have to say that I don't own the Oster, but thought that adding these comments here may help others!
A friend uses a dremel tool (which I imagine is more heavy-duty), but I don't recall exactly how he said to use it, so I thought I would buy the Oster and get my dog (a large lab/chow mix) used to it.  Then if it quit working I'd switch to the dremel tool.  However, since the Oster's instructions are so poor (I reviewed an online pdf of them), getting the Oster didn't sound like a good idea.  Via a google search I found the website [...]  Once you get to that webpage, at the bottom left is a link to a WONDERFUL instructional area for how to use a dremel to trim your dogs nails.  I now have the confidence to use the dremel tool, allowing for enough time to let my dog get used to it!  For those of you who own the Oster, this should help you with its usage as well since the Oster is similar to a Dremel tool.  A HUGE thanks are in order to Dawn Garrett for creating these instructions!",5
"These bags are great for their purpose, we have gone through a few rolls and none have ripped, and no finger nail have broken through. I love the holder! I wish I could find them to put on all leashes.",5
"My puppy loved it!  It rolls, it bounces, it's fun & for us humans, it's easy to find!",5
good price,5
"Great price for this. My dog loves it. I have to say, it has stopped most of his shedding. I have a long haired German Shepherd.  It took about a month of this stuff, but I have noticed a huge difference.",5
It FITS!!! Finally! I've spent close to $100 on harnesses trying to find one that fits my dad's dog! She's chunky & stubby. THIS ONE FIT HER!!!! Yayyyyyyyyyy,5
"loves this.  It is his favorite toy and he just loves playing with it.  Its nice too b/c you don't have to worry about getting your fingers clipped by one of his teeth.  He has managed to break the smaller pieces, but he hasn't completely pulled them off.  I'd recommend this.  For a puppy who tore apart/shredded/broke most toys, this one has held together pretty nicely.",5
"I really appreciate the makers of this product.  It makes carrying water and keeping my dog hydrated super easy.  I can pack this thing along with my gear, its compresses to a tiny size and the rubber is durable.",5
My cats didn't like it as well as the Kitten Indoor.  I have debilitated and elderly cats that receive it because it is higher calorie and easier to eat.,4
Cat was scared of it for about a week.,5
"I purchased a green dragon on count of the description of it's durability.  Our dog who is a mix of border collie/poodle received the dragon
Christmas morning.  Within 5 minutes, she chewed a hole in it, and the squeaker came out.  So much for the double stitching, very
disappointed, the dragon itself is cute for 2 stars.  :(",2
"My cats love this food, this is the right portion size and they have it every day with no problems. They even know when it arrives from Amazon,",5
Does exactly what I need it to do.,5
"Not bad, however, puppy barely bothers with this toy.",3
"It is made in Thailand, but it seems to be good quality",4
Perfect for parakeets' cage. The birds love standing and walking on this perch. It's flexible so very easy for any set up. Much cheaper than local pet stores. Super fast shipping.,5
"I was intrigued by the design of this litterbox but there was no way I could see paying the price for what is obviously a rubbermaid tote box.  Knowing I had at least 5 empty tote boxes in my attic I decided to follow the instructions posted by a previous reviewer and create my own.  I cut a 9"" hole in the top and, using a glue gun, glued an old hand towel to the top and around the edges of the hole.  I put in clean litter and put it in my kitten's bathroom, along with her regular pan of litter.  She was only about 8 weeks old when I made this and I determined that she was still too little to get onto the tote so I used it to store some clean litter.

Well lo and behold, in her 15th week she started to use this litter box on her own.  I noticed she was using her litter pan less and less.  I popped open the lid of my homemade Clevercat box and yep, she made the transition all on her own.

Now I just have one litter box -- this one!

It's a great concept and it does cut down on the litter mess.  I encourage everyone to make their own version though.  Mine is a bit roomier in length than the $30 Clevercat version and best of all...it was FREE to make since I already had the Rubbermaid tote in my attic!

Win/Win!",4
My Dogs love these treats.,5
Ordering again. My crew of six long and short hair kitties gobble this!,5
I'm surprised that Izzy.isn't crazy for these -- he loves dried rabbit treats. Other cats might really like them.,3
"We bought this about a year ago for our Husky/Lab mix. There are no frays or signs of wear and I'd guess this will last another 5 years or more before it needs replacement. There is only a very slight fading of the color and design after a year of constant wear.
I'd highly recommend any product this company makes, they look great and are extremely well built.",5
"My Yorkie puppy hates this brush, not sure if it's the brush or that he hates being brushed, but I only used it once.",3
My dog is almost 13 and she has injured both of her back legs over the years so I try and seek out treats like these to supplement medicine.  My dog loves these and they smell and look just like regular jerky.  In fact my wife almost ate one as she didn't know they were for the dog.  Going to try some of the other flavors and kinds of Jerky by BIXBI to see which one is the best but overall I highly recommend,5
Perfect,5
"I was disappointed when I received this product.  I am sure it was my fault, but it was much shorter than I had expected.  I am sure the description stated the length, but I had recently purchased another one for my Westie and it was much longer.  I needed a smaller one for my Yorkie, but I assumed it would be the same length and it wasn't.  It was good quality, but too short.",3
"This product did the opposite of firming up. It made my Lab's very loose stool ~ runny !! offered it to a customer and his loose stool also became worse. Would not recommend to anyone trying to ""firm up"" their dogs stool.",1
"The bottom surface is slippery in my dogs crate and this slides around. The stuffing is relatively hard compared to our last bumper and our dog isn't a fan of going into his crate as much as he used to. The ends are also not properly squared and the short end seems to taper inward, so its slightly lopsided.",2
"The tubes are too big for a dwarf hamster to climb but would be great for a siryan or any larger breed! While my chubby dwarf is almost too fat for her dwarf made tubes and too tiny for this tube size, my search continues but I do love habitrail and truly believe they make safe fun products! Fully support this company!",4
Great product for my flying squirrels.  It has all the vitamins they need so I don't have to worry.  I've been buying these for years. Always fresh - make sure you refrigerate or freeze immediately.,5
"Months later, I am still having post-traumatic stress from finding a curly tailed smashed mouse within the layers of a Gridlock pad...but I am happy to tell you that I have discovered many USA made under-pads made for humans which are larger and cheaper than these filthy, China made pads.
I purchased directly from Dig it, and when I spoke to them they were as unconcerned with this incident as the Chinese manufacturers of the pet food ingredient that killed thousands of our countries dogs and cats a couple of years ago, so I wouldn't be surprised if these pads also contained carcinogenic ingredients - these people just don't care - their one and only goal is to get as much cash out of our pockets as possible with as little expenditure to them as possible, no matter who it KILLS!!!!",1

"Our medium size dog absolutely loved this Nerf ball.  It is the first time we have tried her with a football shaped ball - we usually go with a typical round one that she likes as well.  It may be that become of the tapered end, but it seemed that she was able to grasp it easier with her mouth.  In any case, we are having a lot of fun playing with her with this toy.",5

"We ordered this for our little chihuahua who is already freezing at 60 degrees outside. Even with 2 shirts and 2 blankets he would still shiver. We got this since it doesn't use electricity and we were worried about having a heated pet bed on while we weren't home. At first he was a little skeptical about it, but now he LOVES it. We put a blanket on top of him and it is super warm inside his little cocoon. If you touch the mat where he was laying you can feel how warm it is. We love it so much we are ordering more for our cat and other places around the house. Definitely recommend.",5
"I am editing this review for the third time as of today 4/30/17.  The first time I ordered these I got 4 in the pkg and was unhappy with the size and quantity as I have a Yorkie and they were gigantic.  I always buy bully sticks for my Yorkie and Shiz Tzu and stick to Best Bully Sticks because some other brands have made my doggies sick.  So buying a pound pkg for $29.74 seemed like a good  deal as I thought I would get 8-9..  I had NO idea I would get 4.  The next time I got 5 and decided this was not such a bad deal as they last a long long time and my dogs can handle them plus I buy the 12"" because I throw away the last 1-2 inches as I'm afraid they might swallow the rest whole or choke.  But the batch I got today had 25 pencil thin ones.  I gave each dog one about 20 minutes ago ago and can't find them.  They chewed them right down I guess.  Bottom line you don't know how many you will get let alone how long they will last - but they don't smell.  Not sure I will buy by the pound again.",4

"This is the BEST tool for training a yapping dog! I have a female Maltese that barks at any little noise and when someone rings the door bell.

I have turned my neighbors on to this product, and they all say ""It has changed their life""!",5

Love it,5
"Purchased this due to being ceramic.  Owned 2 Drinkwell plastic 360's and had problmes with slime build-up had to clean twice a week even using filtered water.  This unit is smaller but hoping I will not have the same slime problem.  May require a little more time when cleaning but that is OK.  My kitties love the fountain water and this is a small inconvience.

This has been up and running for a week and at this time still pleased with the product.",5
These are great mats for littler or food dishes.  They are so hard to find in regular stores.  I would like them in a bigger circle instead of a half circle just so they would actually catch more litter.,5
This bed lasted no longer than 30 minutes the first time we placed it in our dogs kennel.  Completely shredded and tore all the stuffing out of the bed then began to eat it which had us worried we would be making an expensive trip to the vet.  Luckily we got it out before our dog ingested enough to do damage as far as we've seen so far.  If you have a dog that likes to chew or tear their beds apart look elsewhere as I am going to do.  I am thinking of going to a heavy duty rubber mat like used for livestock flooring.  Look elsewhere this bed is by no means CHEW PROOF or even close!!,1
"Works great . Very accurate., and you can turn it off.  Just hold the power button in a couple of seconds until the display goes off!",5
My baby loves this. =),5
works as advertised,4
"Very easy to assemble (which is good because I didn't find any instructions, but to be fair I didn't look for any). My advice - if you're using the divider like I did, put it in before you put the end walls up. It works best if you fold the end walls out, which allows all of the wires to flex more.",5
Cats love these.,5
"My three cats loved it immediately and used it immediately.  I like the looks and the size of it, but is it ever MESSY!  Twice a day I have to clean up bits of cardboard all over the house from my cats scratching on it.  Shouldn't complain though - they love it and leave my furniture and doorways alone!  I will purchase more since it keeps the cats happy.",3
"Nice leash, wish it were a foot longer though and the bottom handle was a bit higher up the lead (or there were two).",4
"It had no effect on my pup and its ugly. Looks like a black rubber collar.  If you are having issues, call in a dog trainer.  Don't waste your money.",1
"This spray was purchased with one intended purpose. Our Bulldog has an enemy, that enemy is the vacuum cleaner! We have to put him in his kennel when we want to vacuum because it is a constant sneak attack while it is out of the closet. Other than his toys he chews on nothing that he shouldn't except for this time frame. He chews at his kennel door and completely tries to obliterate his pillow pad!
I wanted to try this discounted sample bottle of Bitter Spray on the kennel door and corners of his pillow. The first time I tried it he definitely did a double take and was distracted for a moment but powered through and chewed as normal. The second time, I put a lot more on his pillow and door. He left the pillow alone that time but still went after the door. I just don't think it will stay on metal for a long enough period.
It appears that it will work on more porous surfaces, especially if it has recently been added.",4
Dog loves the food.,4
Dogs terrorized this toy in a matter of hours.  Its still holding up after a vicious attack from 3 dogs that mutilate anything.  Will buy again!,4
"Perfect for multiple pets, I have 2 dogs and a cat that love this thing. If your water is from a well you will clean this a little more often (city water has a little chlorine for purification). Be very careful - the clear water bottle reservoir is NOT dishwasher safe. Yes, that's on the box but that doesn't mean morons like me won't make that mistake ;)

Cleaning is a little more work than emptying/refilling but this is worth it for your pets' health.",5
"I have to say my dwarf hamster really liked the tunnel, but it was absolutely TOO large for his cage (and I have a very large cage); and to make my point, my chi-mix little dog was sniffing the tunnel and ran her head all the way down the tunnel and became stuck and HYSTERICAL. I had a horrible time trying to free her head, and thought at one time, I would have to take her to the emergency vet. I am going to order some tunnels but very small ones for my dwarf buddy.",2
"This seat is great for my chihuahua! I had tried a different brand and had to return it. This one is perfect for my little guy. He loves to go on car rides and likes to ride in my lap when possible, but sometimes I need him to ride independently, so this set is perfect! It installs easier than any other seat I have seen. Because my pup is only five pounds, I did not bother with attaching the lower straps to the body of the seat. Putting the strap over the headrest is fine for my dog. The seat is very comfortable for him. I added another cushion, just to boost him up a little higher, so he can see out the window better. I also like the little zippered pouch. I keep an extra leash and some treats in there. This is a great seat and I think it was well worth the higher cost for a quality product. It stays open, and one I tried before kept folding up on my dog, which is not safe. I definitely recommend this booster for your small pup.",5
"This collar was too tight for my dog. She usually wears a 16"" so I thought it would fit. It was too late to return so I dropped it off at the closest dog rescue, where it was greatly appreciated.",3
I have three big dogs and this is a replacement set after having the others for over 5 years.  So much better than a buckle or clip collar - have never had a problem with them breaking or the girls slipping out of it.,5
"My dogs love these bones. I have tried other ones, but this flavor is the one that all of them like. I'm in trouble if I run out.",5
Handy little cards to have...just in case!,5
"Cat hated the hat, but that's not the costume's fault - the cat just has a bad attitude.",5
"I had seen this toy many times, but finally got one and my 4 cats all love it.  I never would have thought that a simple toy like this would interest them.  It has a very smooth and fast movement on the rolling ball and the scratcher is used by my cats too.  You can get the replacement scratcher boards easily.",5
"My dog loved this ball. It is basically what is a plastic water bottle wrapped up in a rubber dog ball. Unfortunately he totally crushed the ball within a few minutes of play, and then tore it to pieces in the time it took me to go to the bathroom.

While he loved this toy I don't think I'll get this again. Way to expensive to just have him destroy the thing.",3
"Fresh water for the pups anytime they want it. Had a small leak at the float valve upon installation. I read the product reviews and found the fix...one of the pieces of tape was missing. Tape on, problem solved. Hose and bowl are very sturdy.",5
"Fits the bottom of my pet carrier almost perfectly.  It is a little wide, but that was necessary to get the length.",5
Nice and deep.  My cat loves the digging action.,4
"Pros: Rechargeable, no prongs, assumed to be more comfortable (my dog doesn't mind me slipping it on and doesn't try to scratch it off, etc). small pendant size. (some units are quite large).

Cons: The remote feels cheap and flimsy. I would have appreciated a more durable matte black rubber coating (similar to some walkie talkies). Short battery life.

My awesome dog is a full sized standard poodle. He weighs about 50 pounds, but is slim without a large neck. My poodle is very well trained and obedient in every way. Except when guests are over lol. He likes to constantly hound the guests for attention. This collar easily corrects the behavior with a gentle buzz. Yes, I have tried it on myself numerous times and found even the highest setting to be tolerable on my thigh and forearms. If you've ever used a muscle stim unit at a chiropractors office, that is how it feels like.

I probably would buy it again just because I don't need to worry about constantly replacing so many batteries. I do wish the rechargeable batteries in the collar lasted longer. I would estimate around 6-8 hours of continuous use, with maybe a few ""corrections"".

Now, when guests come over, I just put the collar on and never even need to really use the unit. In total, I have made less than 2 dozen corrections and his behavior is now nearly perfect. Guests don't have to constantly deal with him hopping around and begging to be petted. lol

I always used the middle setting as I found the low setting to have almost no effect.",4
Rottie pup loves it!  Keeps him busy for quite a while per chewing session.,5
Works like a charm!!!,5
It is ok but paper bedding is better. After this bedding absorb moisture they are very hard to clean off. especially on the corner,3
My dogs absolutely love this. I have been looking for a natural healthy food to store in my camper in case of emergency. Last year with all the wildfires I decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs. I have been vacum sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room. I read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try. My dogs let me know its supper time when I get home now because they are all about this food.,5
"One of our cats ""kills"" his toys every evening by pulling them out of his toy box and walking through the house with it in his mouth meowing.. He always brings them to wherever we are and drops them in front of us as if he's brought us a gift. Makes us laugh.. This toy has been added to his killing spree.. It's held up well. I haven't seen any seams splitting, etc... He likes it.. That's really all that matters...",5
"Really good boost, day starter for older lab.",5
"I purchased these booties after purchasing a TON of other brands. I own a 170# Giant Malamute and none of those other brands have the fit, size, or quality to outlast this dog.  Recently, my dog underwent surgery due to leg infection and I had to fall back on these booties for protection on a day to day basis.  They did not fail me, nor did they EVER come off. Perhaps these other reviews didn't place them on correctly.  My dog wears the XXL size and they fit with a little extra material, which does not bother him.  I believe a little extra space allows for some air circulation.  It also allows for some bandage space, in case your like me and needed to wrap a bandage and have the bootie on.  These booties have lasted me for over 1 year, and they are showing signs of wear.  BUT- he wears these booties every day, not just out hiking.

These are not waterproof.  I did spray the outside with water resistant spray for hiking boots and it helped.  Overall a great product over Ruffwear and the red booties.  I did order 4 and one bootie was sewn a little oddly so we can't use that one.  You do have to maintain these booties, cleaning the velcro from all the hair or they will not stick.  Overall good fit, comfy for the dog and lightweight.  Good for price.  Good light hiking booties.  I wouldn't do endurance hikes with them, not much underlying foot/pad protection from really sharp objects - I'd go for a more ""protective"" sole if I was to do that with my dog.

I would recommend this product.",4
dog loves this treats,5
Our new lab puppy loves her dish. It's heavy enough that she can't push it around and turn it over as big clumsy puppies do.,5
Love it.  Need a second for when I need to wash this one.,5
Cute toy.,4
"These are easy to break up and put in with her food.  I thought they would be more like a treat, but they are crumbly and work better in food.  My dog doesn;t balk at eating them so I guess they taste alright.  I trust that they are doing some good.  I am trying to prevent problems so can't see any difference.",4
My dog broke lose of the gentle leader when he saw another dogs and was jumping around a bit.  Be very careful on sizing!  It would be ideal if this product came with a safety like the halti does.,2
"I don't really love it, but our cats sure do.  This is a high quality food that our veterinarians recommended.",5
"worthless, especially on a large dog.",2
Keeps our cats under control!,5
Wasn't a fan... Some of the cheap litters are better than this one. It's very dusty & purfumey!,3
"Hello folks.  Well, this was a total waste of money.  It was way too much water for my little dog and to keep the water in the well for the amount of time it would take her to drink would enable bacteria to grow (IMHO).  In addition, each time I set it down, I spilled water all over the floor.  I tried different methods (crawling from the sink to the location was one) but none seemed to accomplish the dry placement.  Stopped using it within 2 days.  Should have sent it back.  May give it to someone who has a larger dog.  Might work for them.",1
Wish they offered a grain free version.,4
Extremely attractive and super sturdy. I have bought three of these now.  Great value. One of my orders was incorrect because I ordered a 6 ft grey and got a 4 ft blue leash- however the shorter length has been very useful so all in all I could not be happier.,5
"My cat and my Doberman/Shepherd both love this toy. It's sturdy and fun. I do have to put the toy away at night because that tends to be when my cat likes to play with it the most and it's pretty loud in the middle of the night. It is possible for the ball to come out of the track so children and dogs need to be supervised around this toy. The product shown was blue and the one we got was purple, but my pets didn't seem to mind at all.",5
good,5
My dogs love them,5
"This is my 2nd crate dog likes it great price 2 doors ,easy to use, built well.",5
Matches my dog collars!,5
"I originally planned to do all my puppy's feeding through toys. The good news is our dog is not particularly food motivated so he would not get enough nutrition through toys alone. I waited to try this until he was 19 weeks old. He tried to get some food and medicine then just started to chew the plastic uprights. He is actively teething, so put it away until he is older.
His favorite kibble toy is a Gatorade bottle with the cap and ring removed. He rolls it around if not hungry but if he decides it is mealtime, he carries it over to the steps - uses his paws to stand it up - and then tips it over to dump the kibble. Smart puppy!",3
This is a great dispenser toy and it keeps my dogs busy!,5
"It works at removing stuck poo.  It seems to help with the smell too.  I got some on my hand and it caused a mild irritation.  It says you can use it while the animal is still in the cage and i strongly disagree because of that.  None of my animals have shown any signs of irritation after having used this product on their cages, but I am still careful to dry the area before putting the animals back just in case.",3
"Lord this runs small so take measurements of your pets. Quality of the fabric is great, and style is fab.
I purchased an xl and 2 xl but they are the same size. Fits my terrier but not my pit bull .
Good thing my friend has a little dog so the sweater won't go to waste.",4
"These cubes are very flimsy  =  on day two the metal structure inside has already given out for our small size adult cat who loves cubes.
You can find better ones at Walmart for $3.88 if you don't mind Pink or Blue.",3
My dog loves this stuff and it seems to help his previous tummy troubles.,5
"Love it, feels great, but not like what was shown in the picture. That orange thing was not by the clasp.",5
I don't see where these collars work,2
"I do not feel that this is a proper bed for a cat.  Initially, I ordered this bed because I liked that it is fluffy and that it is reversible.  One side is fuzzier to provide warmth in the winter while the other side is, well, NOT fuzzy, so your cat doesn't overheat in the summer.  The bed looks nice and all, but it is very soft and bumpy rather than flat and stable.  It shook if the cat was placed into it, which he didn't like.  I tried to attract my cat to it using catnip, his favorite blanket, treats, and other methods, and he refused to sleep in it.  As I started observing my cat, I noticed that he preferred to sleep on hard surfaces: tables, chairs, cardboard boxes, beds, the floor, etc...

My sister bought my cat a round, flat bed that is soft but not overly furry or fuzzy.  He loves sleeping in that bed.  It is sturdy because it is flat and not even 0.5 inches thick from the bottom.  Also, he likes to sleep curled up in a ball, in what we humans call the fetal position.  The other bed easily allows him to do that because it is a round bed.

Save your money and don't buy this bed.  Cats are rather simple animals.  I saw the bed my sister bought my cat in a store for $10.  I bet it might've been cheaper online.  This bed, while nice, was not worth it.  Now it is just sitting in my house taking up space, and I have no idea what to do with it after all the money I spent on it.  I guess I'll try to give it away or resell it.",2
Our cat was not feeling well and our vet suggested FortiFlora. We mixed it with some canned food and she ate it all. Asked for more. We have continued [6 months or so] to feed it mixed with a tea spoon of canned along with enough water to make a soup. Her coat is better and her overall health better. We continue using it every morning.,5
"Fits nice into your pocket, great durable material strong color",5
great price and works,5
"Fish and snails love it too, even goldfish.",5
"I bought this Sisal Rope to repair my scratching post,
Pulled off the old rope that was falling off and spread wood glue on the post. Then wrapped the rope around tightly and cut the end and left to dry out of reach of my cats until the glue was set.  I still have lots of rope left and will be able to use this for several more cat post repairs.",5
Ill always use this product and highly advice pet lovers to keep this on hand when pups are on there way because mommy needs this to keep her calcium in check when pups are draining mom while nursing,5
"I really didn't want to use a bark collar, but our dog just wouldnt stop barking. This one is nice because it doesnt go off when another dog barks - which was a big concern. Weve only had to use this collar three or four times for him to realize that he shouldnt bark with it on. Now that he knows, we put it on him without turning it on and his barking stops. Highly recommend.",5
"Could NOT fit our large lab into the XL harness. He hated it and I am so mad that I wasted my money on this. It barely fit around his neck with some stretching but the rest of the harness would not fit due to his ribcage being too large for it. I purchased the extra large in blue. It would have been adorable for a medium sized dog. If you have a large dog  do not purchase the XL harness ... it will not fit. I think it may have fit a female lab they tend to be smaller but I have seen them get fairly large too so, never mind I cannot recommend this for any lab owner ... unless you have a smallish lab.",1
i have a french bulldog that is allergic to everything.  adding this to his diet has helped with his skin allergies to pollen and grass,5
"my germen shepherd had a crack half way through within 5 minutes of playing.  He is an aggressive chewer but he was playing tug of war with my husband.  I put it up while my husband wasn't home so it's still in one piece.  Don't expect it to make it past second play time.

1 day later, it's now in 3 pieces. broke off on both sides of the center hump.",3
"Received brown and not looking good, but I put them in the water and hoped for the best. Between hydration and the fish picking awY at the outside these are recovering nicely.",3
My pups love them!!!,5
My schnauser has gone thru about 7 of these Captain Chicks(his most loved toy) Got one for our big dog and she loves hers too.  Most loved dog toy I know of....,5
"Great price! My dogs love these treats and I managed to teach them several new ""tricks"". Nothing like giving them healthy treats that they like so much. HIGHLY recommend!",5
"I have 3 of the Merry Pet Cat Washroom/Night Stands  and find them a lot cleaner than having an open box where the cats get the dirt outside the box when covering their business.  I thought my cats might not take to the Washrooms because they were enclosed with just a small opening , but they took to them right away even my 19lb cat has no problem using the box.  I kind of like to think they feel they have more privacy than an open litter box.",5
This what I feed my dogs all the time. It is a good food without all of the fillers,5
Very nice easy to use nail clippers. We have two big dogs and these worked extremely well on their large nails.,5
My turtles love this,5
meow!!!!!!!!  love it love it love it.  all i have to do is bring out the bag AND SHE KNOWS IT'S FOR HER,5
Great collar. I ordered a medium for our dog with an 18 inch neck. Love the blue with lime green letters and phone number.,5
I use this in my planted tank and it seems to give good results,4
This is great high-quality food out Clowder of Cats really enjoy and eat?,5
My dog looks so cool in this,5
My poor kitty was put on a diet by our vet and she said if were going to give him treats greenies are the only way to go. My vet explained thats greenies are good cat my cats teeth and much healthier the other treats.,4
"I had used PetTabs for years with my dogs, but I found these and decided to give them a try. The composition is similar, the price is better, and my dogs both think they're getting treats when I give these to the pups in the morning!",4
"I've been buying these since I discovered they are a lot better price and quality compared to Petco, Petco's training pads have some weird white powder that scattered all over the floor when I unfolded them.",5
"I am blown away! I bought and was using another thinning scissor in the $40 price range. They had an area which grabbed and pinched but didn't cut the hair towards the ends (both). Wish I would of know about these then, they are a pleasure to use. Sharp, no sticking points and cleanly cut hairs along the whole length of the scissor.",5
Just received the muzzle and all I can say is thank you! thank you! thank you! Great product. I have a little Yorkypoo.... so I got the 5 inch just put it on him went out for a 15 minute walk & he tried to get it off but couldn't I would say for the first five minutes....we saw a dog and he couldn't bark wonderful love love love now we can have a peaceful walk!,5
My rescue boy loves this food and he is doing well on it.,5
My hamsters love these. I put their bathing sand in them. They end up sleeping in there because they are so cozy.,5
my dog has to have the food mixed with something so she will eat it.  She is very picky.,3
my lab has allergies to the point he has too get allergy shot every 10 days this shampoo really helps his skin,5
"I recently purchased a dying betta fish from a large chain store. I felt so bad for him. I was able to purchase everything I needed but a heater for him. I received the heater a few days ago and now my little buddy, who is now doing so much better, is warm and happy. The heater works well. It has a small glowing red light on it to show you its on and working. It is small enough not to interfere with my Betta's activities. The suction cup keeps it in place on the side of the bowl. I am pleased with it",5
My mastiffs adore these dog beds and they are sturdy.  So glad I found them.,5
"Ive bought these for years but something has happened to the quality in the last year or so. I do not over feed these but lately both of my dogs are having gastric upset, diarrhea and vomiting. Nothing has changed in their diet but when I eliminated these treats, the stomach problems went away. Were just making our own chicken jerky now. Tired of the worry about where companies source their ingredients.",2
"This is wonderful for one normal-sized cat or kitten, its to small for larger cats. It pretty strong over all and made pretty well for the price. It's easy to put together took me about 15 min with two little ones stealing the parts. It should only take one person about 10 min to put together. The only thing I wish was better is the type of fabric they used on it but at $31 there's really nothing to complain about",5
"We love this! Our cat was always sad when the dog got to go for a walk and she didn't, so we got this to be able to take her along. She LOVES it! And she isn't small enough to escape from the openings, luckily. Only problems are that the wheels wear down fast and it is a little difficult to steer at times.",4
My dog ate this in a day lol! Definitely for smaller puppies. My boxer pup made quick work of it!,5
I bought these because my cat had a bad case of diarrhea. I wanted to try probiotics before I took her to the vet. I dosed her for 2 days and on the 3rd day I noticed normal bowel movements!  I don't know if it was from the probiotics or she just got over whatever was wrong with her. I will be purchasing these again though as I give it to my dogs as well .,5
"I have to give one of my cats pills for a chronic condition.  She is INCREDIBLY fussy and picky.  She is a rescue cat and cannot be restrained or picked up without causing panic on her part, so I need her to cooperate in taking her pills.  Pill pockets don't work, tuna water will work for MAYBE one dosing, and other soft kitty treats will work for maybe a day before she catches on.  I've had these treats for a week and she hasn't yet turned her nose up to them.  The treats are soft enough to wrap around the pills so she can't taste/smell them immediately.

Great stuff and 2 of the other 3 cats also love them.  Highly recommend them for fussy kitties!",5
My Lab and my Silky Terrier love this bed. It looks great and it's not heavy like some beds are.,4
"The positive reviews sold me, but this item did not work as assumed or intended. The dogs would rather chew on an old water bottle and ignored this completely. I assume that it was the smell of the rubber that turned them off.  I saw this for sale in PetSmart for 19.99 - figured I'd give it a try at a lower cost. My search continues.",1
"Super, super tiny",5
"I bought this feeder because my cat gets obnoxious while i'm sleeping if he gets hungry. I now feed him 5 times a day spaced4-5 hours apart. 4 servings of 1/8 cup dry food, and i leave the 5th slot empty, and just feed him a bit of wet food when it turns to that empty one, and refill the rest with dry food for the next day. so far this is working amazingly, and he doesn't beg for food anymore.

As for trying to get it open himself, he only tried for the first three days, was unsuccessful for the most part, and has never again tried to pry it open again",5
Beautiful leash for the pretty little lady that you take for a walk,5
So far the product is as described.  Now training my dog to use it instead of potty pads.  So I will have to come back after a few weeks of use.  It is made of quality material - not flimsy.  I am happy that the item fits in my dog's crate perfectly (I took measurements prior to placing my order).  It arrived quickly which is great.  I want to get her trained to use instead of using potty pads on the wood floor.,5
"I wasn't sure about this product and boy was I wrong! Its important to note that when treating any kind of tear stains, you need that area to stay as dry as possible! This eye powder helps with that. I dab a bit on after Ive cleansed the eyes and applied tear stain remover, and dried with a blow dryer (cool, on low)  absolutely love this product and it does exactly what it should!",5
"One of our dogs has a problem with hip joint and tendon. The Vet said to give the Soft Chews for the rest of her life.  It might help, it might not, the jury is still out. We purchased these because they are the same product but much less expensive than at the Vet's office.  The dogs get 2 a day and since they are young, we will save a lot of money over the years by buying here. We have one dog that likes them and one that must be teased into eating them.  Perhaps a different flavor would be helpful for those picky eaters? Regardless, they will get them forever.",5
Seems to work- recommended by a vet,5
"I don't like this belt at all. Maybe my dog moves too much or Im too skinny (I hope!), but it moves on my hips and bounces as I run. My dog moving at all moves the belt around, making it much harder to run.",2
Great quality and lasts a while in the aquarium. Lasts longer than the bargain brand carbons. I love the price too.,5
Fantastic food. My dogs both love it. One dog has grain reactions and has no trouble when on this diet.,5
"The gate has the rounded corner at the bottom towards the floor and the flat edge at the top...this results in four exposed ends with plastic caps which may result in water eventually entering.  The latch assembly is horrible and anyone not familiar with it won't know how to enter...maybe good for burglars!  The stainless steel parts didn't arrive with the gate so I will have to disassemble it later.  My solution was to turn the gate upside down and have the rounded end on top, which I think looks much better anyway.  The materials are good, but with the expandability feature of the gate there is a lot of potential standing water on the gate and a weakening of the structure.  All in all I would rather have a single size gate with a latch that is well designed. I would not suggest purchasing this gate for any medium or large dog that wants to jump on the gate.",1
Perfect fit for our female Scottie dog and no neck stress!,5
She looks forward to it,5
"Bigger than I rhough it was. Maybe a little too but but I could get inside our larg bunny hutch. We have been using it for about 2 months., It appears to be high quality and durable.",3
"This has served muliple purposes for us. Our puppy didn't like it as a playpen, but it did set up easily and looked really nice. It's very roomy! We have used it as a gate several times. We have even used it as a gate outside on our deck. It's been out in the sun and rain all summer and had held up beautifully!",5
"Perfect fit for my 4-5lb yorkie! Except my dog tries to get out of it while in the water and he doesn't like it. My other yorkie seems to be okay with it, she still tries to swim with it on and its easy to see in the water. She's about 6-8 lbs so we got the next size up.",5
"Great toy for a big, active dog.  He loves it in the pool as well.",5
my dogs love these,5
"Dentastix came quickly and my dog just loves them. Our dog Bella loves them and every morning she gets a Dentastix or as we call them a ""Toothbrush"". I break them in  half as they are a little on the expensive side and she will devour the whole one as quickly as she eats the half. She dances around when I go to the cabinet or she will  be waiting for me at the cabinet. Anything that makes our girl happy makes mommy and daddy happy too!",5
Product kept my fur bean calm during our two hour car ride to our new home.,5
Love this super durable,5
It is a wonderful collar. I hope it works lie they advertize because my dog backs out of her current collar.,5
Did exactly what it said it would! Thank you!,5
It doesnt drip water! Thank goodness I found one!!,5
good,5
"This is an outstanding shampoo as well as an outstanding value. Left both my dogs' coats silky and shiny, and since it is mixed 5 parts water to 1 part shampoo it is very economical. Non-drying, and easy to rinse out.",5
Cats like it..for now LOL,4
This is my puppies FAVORITE toy. I've had to buy 3 of them so far because she tears the feather off of it...or it gets gross. It scared my cat to death but my puppy is obsessed...sometimes I think she thinks it's her best friend haha,5
"Our cat household has been using this product for years.  I like that it's from Arm & Hammer, which makes the baking soda I use to clean half my house. I just sprinkle a little of the deodorizer in each time I clean or change the litter box, and it keeps everything smelling fresh. (I also clean it often, so that helps.)  I've tried other cat litter deodorizers but none is as good as this one. Why mess with success?",5
As expected.,5
I bought 3 similar beds (2 by accident) and this one is by far the softest and looks the nicest. The color is a natural cream/ivory compaired to a yellowy fleace of the cheaper ones. The others have more padding but my dog actually prefers this one.,5
"My cats loved it! Zero hesitation, no ""This isn't our regular food"", just face-in-bowl enthusiasm! I've tried other dry foods which they've ignored, so the difference with this food was clear. If my cats like it, I like it.",5
"My labrador retriever likes it. I don't know if that will reflect the light and makes me blind, from his teeth or not... ha ha. I think the best way to clean their teeth are to give them rope toys and rope ball !!! I believe that is more scientific than this chew !!!",4
"This product is great, my corals love it. I add it right before the light go out for the night and the next day the tank looks awesome. Corals are expanded to the fullest and the water even looks clearer.",5
"Currently using this in my biocube, big increase over the stock pump",5
I ordered this product 2 days ago...they delivered yesterday....this bubble maker is amazing....fine bubbles and my discus fish love it too...has no noise at all...i ordered another one too...im changing my air pumps for this guys.....,5
Love it! I use it for my 6lbs Chihuahua who sometimes gets weird at other dogs. I like to let her roam a bit but need to shorten the leash when she's being grumpy. The switch on the handle is pretty easy once you get the hang of it and makes it so you can customize the leash length.,5
highly recommended by our vet. this supposedly is specially made for dogs and is true for what it states for ingretients. used to use whatever was available until our vet told us different and this really seems to do the trick,5
"I love the tags, just took way longer than the expected delivery date. They do look just like the picture shown though.",4
Thi is a very nice crate which fits my maltese very well. She loves to go take naps in it and eats her dinner there undisturbed.,5
This definitely worked with my puppy.  All that I had to do was spray a few sprays and she would walk away.  I took off one star because the bottle was very small.,4
Perfect size for a treat and chew time.,5
This cage is good for 1 piggie (Piggies need to have space to move around and run and play).  It's definitely one of the biggest guinea pig cages sold (besides building a C&C cage). It was very easy to put together. I like how they provide a piece to divide the cage so that you can keep the food and water separated from the living space. I use fleece bedding with this cage and it works great but I'm sure if you used the regular bedding it would be fine because the bottom part can be easily removed and cleaned.  I ended up getting a 2nd guinea pig so I upgraded to a bigger cage but I still use this when I'm cleaning the big cage. I've also used it outside without the bottom on it so the piggies can eat the grass and move around without running away. It's a great portable cage because it can be folded up.  Definitely recommend for someone who has 1 piggie (the cages sold in pet stores are far too small even for 1 pig).,5
"My dogs loved this, but it ended up chewed to pieces in about an hour.",3
"I had to purchase a new harness when my 7 lb Pomeranian informed me that he was not happy with my first selection by chewing it completely through in the middle of the night.

This harness has been great.  We recently drove 25 hours cross country and he was comfortable wearing the harness for the entire ride.  I have used this harness on a leash, in my doggie car seat attached to a seat belt clasp so he can stick his head out the window without mommy panicking and also in a bicycle basket so he can go on rides with me.  It has worked beautifully at every task I've thrown at it.

It is very well constructed and with everything I've put it through, there is no fraying or stray nylon fibers sticking out.  Looks as good today as the day I bought it.

[...]  Thanks!",5
Great for teething puppies as a reward,5
"What I loved was that the seller contacted me ahead of time with a lovely letter.  Not only is the pajama adorable, it fits my 14 lb. shih Zhu perfectly.  It's so soft and cuddly.  Wish I could find a pj with that material.",5
"The scent of this hay was like lying in a field of freshly cut hay. Soft and green, my chinchilla loves it!",5
Fits a 35# mix breed dog's snout perfect.,5
"This Healthy Pet Bedding is pretty much the same as the unbleached/undyed CareFresh that we've been using in my son's rats' cage.  We've read that this kind of bedding is the healthiest for small animals.  I don't think I could tell the difference between Healthy Pet and CareFresh if you took the labels away.  I would not hesitate to buy this brand in the future.

I am giving this 4 stars, rather than 5, because of the cost.  This Healthy Pet bedding isn't any more expensive than other brands, but it still seems like a lot of money for what it is.  None of these brands really seem like a good value.",4
Dogs love this product!  They get so happy when it's time to brush their teeth. Fast shipping. Good price.,5
Please Please never stop carrying these! I cannot find them in stores. Love the product! easy to break in half as a training treat for my little 10lb puppy.,5
The plastic is thin and I didn't feel like it was going to hold up for what I needed it for.,3
"This did not work at all.  I have two Queensland pups,  one went over the other went under.  Installed it in a Suburban.  I gave it to my daughter who has two older small dogs and it does the job with no problem.",1
"Love these bags and love how quickly I received them! I've used just about every bag manufactured by mankind, and these are my new faves!",5
"If I could give the product 6 stars, I would.

This tie out kept my girl in the yard with enough room to make me feel like a proper husband, yet not too much where she could be seen by  our nosy neighbors (we live in a heavily wooded / rural area). So I feel good about giving her more time outside now.

Thanks, Obama.",5
Works great. My dog knows when he is wearing this collar and never barks when he has it on. He learned very quickly. Its adjustable to fit super large to very small. Its nice that it was water resistant so you don't have to worry about it getting wet in the rain. My only complaint is that I wish it came with an on/off button. The only way to turn it off is to remove the battery. This makes the battery easy to lose. Since battery replacements for this item are not cheap I remove the battery whenever it is not in use. I would be much easier with an on/off button.,4
Dog has not chewed up like most toys,5
"I'm glad the online description states it is FOR SOFT CHEWERS, because the packaging in the store did not and this rubber does NOT hold up to real chewers.  My dogs quite effectively disembodied this guy.
What is most disappointing is that the body is not solid rubber.  Once the rubber was torn, I could see that it is a very thin layer with foam inside. I attempted to remove the foam (to decrease the mess and save my girls from swallowing some) but it really sticks to the cloth arms/legs/ears.
However, there is a positive note: while the rubber is easily torn, it doesn't break down with slobber (i.e. green dye mess, stretched thin pieces). My dogs did not swallow any of the material, they just broke it into pieces and then gnawed on it.  Also, the cloth arms/legs/ears have held up.  Based solely on that, I agree it is okay for soft chewers - but be warned if you have an actual chewer.",2
Definitely helps with trapping litter. If only it helped our cats weird obsession with playing and kicking the litter all over the room.,4
"I can't get my dogs interested in this toy.  It will last forever, but only because it never gets any attention.",1
My Maltese dog loves it.,5
"My cats love this and I love the cost, especially with Prime's free shipping!  I love that I only handle it once when I get it through delivery as opposed to handling it three times when I have to go get it.",5
My papillon had this Destroyed in 20 minutes. Had to move to Kong Extreme toys. Fun while it lasted. Not made for a chewer.,3
Legit makes my dog's pain go away.,5
"These are great, my dog doesn't get them more than a few a month so the bag lasts for a while.  They keep my hyper chewing dog busy for 20 minutes or so, good distraction.",5
"I did some checking on the pill pockets and this was the best purchase rate.  Delivery was prompt which was great.  I am always buying these because I have several dogs of which get vit. pills, and other meds.
Wonderful item",5
Fast delivery.  Great deal.  My dogs love it.,5
"Great idea but with my coarse hair yellow lab, the hair stuck and clung to the material even after washing due to the material. We live in a really hot area and find that the material is too wide which made her hot.
It is a good product and would recommend depending on the breed and hair type.",3
I love these collars. The buckle is awesome because it is quick release but doesn't come apart like the plastic ones. I also added a riveted name tag to it. Very durable collar,5
My dogs absolutely love this food. And it's an awesome price for such a great product.,5
This is really and simple to put together. My kitty loves hers.,5
He do number 1 always no number 2 yet good quality we cleaned every day,5
Works great. Perfect fit.,5
This is my absolute favorite PJ brand. The medium fits my 8 pound shaved Pom perfectly. He was scarred by an animal abuser and does not feel secure without clothes Other brands have been loose and his back legs come out. These are a perfect fit.,5
This is a really nice collar-I use it for my deaf dog!,4
"My dogs love the taste of these. They firmly believe they that they are receiving a special treat each morning. The package says that the product should be taken for 30 days before the benefit is seen so if you need immediate tick/flea prevention, I suggest you purchase a natural flea/tick collar and/or shampoo at the same time to provide the pet with extra coverage while waiting for this product to take over the job.",5
Love the glowing ball! But wish it would not have those wholes and be a little more solid. My dog chews them up on the wa back from fetching.,3
Wonderful collar...just on the special side like my pet. Looked in all the stores for cute collars. Did not want rhinestones. She looks darling in it. Plus its well made and easy to put all her tags on.,5
"These balls are AWESOME!  It's taken me a while to post a review but in the time from when I got these to now, my once small Cane Corso puppy has grown into a massive 150lb 'mini Clydesdale'. LOL  As you can probably guess, in that time, the pressure that he's had in his chewing and teething phases have been nuts, but these Chuckit's have surprisingly have lasted through it all.  All I have to do is wash these off and they look almost brand new.  If you have a dog that is a heavy chewer and/or will probably grow into a miniature Clydesdale like mine, then you know how hard it is to find toys for them.  These balls have been a life saver for me and my furniture.",5
to hard and crunchy. not good for older dogs.,1
Best one around as far ass my results keep telling me..,5
"This fish tank is fun.  It's small.  The rocks are plastic and most of the time float.  Occasionally they sink to the bottom and stay there, but other times they float back up to the top.  That is annoying.  The fish swim or perhaps shake and bob up and down rather.  The fish are cute though and the tank looks just like a miniature fishbowl.

It only runs on batteries so there is no plug option.  I only turn it on occasionally so I am not sure how long the batteries will last.

The fish don't eat or poop so there is no cleaning.  And even if you did need to clean it you can remove the fish and not worry about they dying from being out of the water.",3
Our dog loves them!!!!!,5
My cat won't go near it and puked up everything in his gut when I forced him. My cat won't go near it!,1
"Initial review.  I just started feeding this to my pets.  I will come back in 30 days to provide a review, I'm expecting good results.

Hello Emily!  I just received my order from Amazon.com and fed it to my rescued furbabies, Twinkie, a Jack Russell Terrier/Chihuahua mix, Cocoa, a purebred Chihuahua and Ring Ding, a Tuxedo cat.

I bought two bottles and didn't know that they only get a 1/4 of a teaspoon!  All of them at under 15 lbs. That's ok.  If it works, I'll be happy.  My little Chi seems to be allergic and is scratching and biting all the time, poor thing.  I mainly bought it because of him.  I will post an initial review,  more of a comment,  on Amazon.  In 30 days, I should see results. I know you have a 60 day guarantee. That's wonderful.

Regards,  Ruth",5
"Works great, hedgehog fits very nice in it and used it quickly. No issues. Would for sure order from them again. Came when said and had no issues. Thank you so much.",5
"Awesome sturdy snake. Upon reading the reviews we promptly clipped the tongue off before handing the toy over. We should have clipped the eyes off too but they seems we well attached......DIESEL made short work of them however. Although this snake does not have KNOTS, it is an extremely sturdy rope and should last. DIESEL does like his knots though.",5
I feed four cats.  One of the outside cats comes close to this ...beef and the chicken variety ...and walks away.  Will not eat it.  The other outside cat and my two inside cats eat a little and I throw away the rest.  No matter how the can is marked...beef or chicken...it smells like fish.  Will NOT order again.  I it wasn't so much trouble to do so I would return it.  Sine this is cat food and the cats will not eat it seems like enough of a reason to give a poor review.,1
O My! My Larry Byrd loves these and I'm quite pleased! He's supposed to eat pellets and veggies only. I could never get him to eat pellets and he Loves these,5
wow.. magnet is so weak,1
Very good quality leash! Loved the colar for my dog Zoey. They did a great job with fast shipping!,5
"These tablets are quite large -- too large for my cats -- but they crush very easily with the side of a knife.  My cats don't even notice I've put them in their wet food.  My male cat was showing signs of a UTI, so I started giving him these once or twice daily diluted with the Kin Bio UTI Control liquid and he's now not peeing anywhere except the cat box.  Crisis averted.  These little tablets seem to really help!",5
Great,5
The dog loves them. I decided to buy these when she refused to eat another dental chew.,5
ALL my dogs love them & that's really hard to accomplish. They didn't have to be tricked into eating them. The dogs think they're treats. I love the fact the chews aren't funky smelling! Really do seem to be helping even the oldest dog's arthritis...which acts up more when it's cold. I look forward to effects of continued use.,5
Did not work for either of my boys.,1
Cats like.,5
Makes my puppy smell so good. I just want to cuddle him all dat.,5
"Convenient style, not a loud click though.",4
"My dog is obsessed with the hand held lasers, so I thought this would be a great alternative for us. I did end up returning this because it moves entirely too fast. It may work better for a cat but even then I think it would still be better if there were speed settings.",2
So far so good with Mojo.  He's finicky but will eat these.,5
I am picky about what I feed my dog.  He is a very finicky eater.  He loves these.  The 1st ingredient is beef.  I only feed my dog the best.  Give these a try.,5
"Wonderful brush, easy to hold. The size and shape of the brush make it easy for my children to assist in grooming the dog. The pins are flexible for a gentle grooming. Aside from the handle this brush is very similar, if not identical, to regular Conair hairbrushes for humans. It will probably not last forever but does the job in the meantime very nicely.",4
"This was the only product that came to my attention when I made the impulse purchase of a solitary little ""cavy.""  Even the cage and water bottle that I purchased at the same time were made by Kaytee.  (When my wife realized that I'd introduced a sizeable ""rodent"" into our household, she had second thoughts about her earlier refusal to admit a small potbelly pig into the household--which actually might have involved less expense and labor than a single guinea pig!)

But guinea pigs are like baseball whereas ""real"" pigs are basketball and football combined.  And just as baseball rewards the patient spectator with an occasional thrill during a long wait, guinea pigs are capable of small surprises.  In over 2 years mine has never bitten me.  And when I pick him up, he's learned to be as passive as a baseball player at the command: ""Be still!""  And it's not until the follow-up command, ""Good boy, Sparky!"", that he vacates my hand and rushes to the wheat grass plant that was part of my super-market haul.

Unfortunately, Supermarkets don't stock small critter food, so I've gone to Amazon and made discoveries about a cavy's eating habits and preferences that were totally unexpected.  Sparky is every bit as fastidious as our two cats, each of which has a different food preference--coming down not merely to wet vs. dry but brands and sub-brands. And once you introduce a new favorite, the cavy--just like the cat--renounces the old, disregarding it altogether in favor of casting undeserved blame upon the giver.

So you think you've finally found the one food that pleases each of the individual livestock members in your household--only to discover the pet's total aversion to that food after you've (perhaps inadvertently) served them something they like better.

Once I thought ""Meow Mix"" was not only a bargain but a sure-fire bet for both cats.  Now, neither one will have anything to do with it--and when they have no choice, they nibble at it and proceed to vomit it back at me.  The same is true of Kaytee Supreme Diet.  To my guinea pig it's become the equivalent of the ""mush"" (cooked oat meal) I was served as a kid.  Sparky's food of choice is not even easy to remember or pronounce.  It began as my 4th or 5th attempt at a ""treat""  for Sparky.  I have yet to find one that will get a rise out of either cat, which in itself is enough to make a potbelly all the more attractive. Hold up an apple, a candy bar, a gum stick to a real pig and it will immediately oink ""Game on!""  But guinea pigs are as hard to please as cats.  So I was doubly rewarded--both surprised and gratified--to watch Sparky ""popcorning"" and doing airborne spirals when I gave him a small bowl of Vitakraft Vita Prima Sun Salad Treat.  The price is a bit high, but the response I witnessed from my otherwise placid, little eating-and-sleeping machine, made it worth the cost.

But now, the same company that makes the Sun Salad ""Treat"" has come to market with a more affordable and nutritious ""total food diet""--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUN-Vita-Guinea-Pig-4lb/dp/B000XS2NHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUN Vita +- Guinea Pig 4lb</a>--and it seems to get preferential treatment from my little guy that makes the same company's ""Salad Treat"" superfluous--an extra, unnecessary expense.

If you're doing OK by the pictured Kaytee product, stick with it.  It's economical and does the job (unlike a product I purchased from a local store that caused my hamsters to lose their hair!).  But don't introduce any new foods.  Chances are your small critter will prefer one, and you'll only feel guilty when you don't have the new food on hand.",3
Saved my betta after many other products failed.  Thanks kanaplex!,5
my dogs are VERY rough with their tug toys and this has lasted and still in great shape,5
My three beagles LOVE these. Their favorite treat.,5
"This stuff doesn't clump very well and if you touch it with wet hand it's kinda slimy.
I love the scent it isn't gross headache causing perfume. It's smells nice.
I hate the clumping though.  If you have a cat like mine that digs to the bottom of the box then the urine spreads along the bottom of the box and clumps to the box making clean up a little difficult. Scooping the pee spots you have to be careful shaking the dry off or you can break up the clump.
For me the scent makes up for the clumping nightmare. So far this or plain wood pellets are my go to litter since I don't like clay and I hate perfumed litter.",4
Works great,5
"I used this conditioner on my 11 year old black lab whose coat had lost its luster and was quite rough. To our very pleasant surprise, this helped restore his fur to a deep shiny black that's soft without being the least greasy; there's no residue or residual smell. I also used it on a young golden retriever with itchy skin and along with helping her coat, too, it seemed to settle her skin.",5
These can be found for thirteen bucks on pet smart com. :/ Kinda seems like a rip at this price.,4
works for my cats,5
"Follow the directions carefully and it'll be easy to put together, but be sure to have a measuring device to measure the posts or it gets tricky. I messed up once and I had to back-track 2 steps, kind of annoying but still easy to assemble/reassemble.

Not particularly intended for (a) kitten(s) which I have, and the manufarture warned against, but the kitten still seems to thoroughly enjoy the lower shelving. I can't wait to see him grow into it!",4
Seems a little flimsy.  I'm used to a cord leash. Good thing it has a warranty. Appreciate the fact that the company contacted me about the product. That was a pleasant surprise and well received. Thank you.,4
Awesome indestructible toy!,5
"Perfect bribe for that picky dog in your life! My German Shepherd/Siberian Husky mix and Belgian Malinois LOVE these treats.  High reward value makes these perfect for when we are working on advanced skills and behaviors.  They were also perfect for a loose dog running around.  Nothing else worked but the Kangaroo jerky did the trick! He quickly went from being reserved and ignoring me to following me around and letting me handle him.  The strips are easy to break apart into smaller bits for training and are amazing for dogs with sensitivities and/or allergies since the only ingredient is Kangaroo (one of the best proteins for dogs with allergies or sensitivities).  This is one treat that is always in my house and will continue to be.  It doesn't smell or leave a greasy residue like other treats.  With a working service dog these are amazing and I cannot say enough good things, these continue to be in my secret stash for emergency situations or sudden need for a training session.",5
Received both broken. Bird doesn't use them anyway!,3
"I liked the size for the crate I had, but my dog didn't like her create. She destroyed her bed. Was a good bed!",4
They actually fight over who gets to play with this ball. I got a black one so they could each have one but they both want the red one. I have pits so its rare to find a toy that will last their chewing but this is still going strong. I highly recommend but get a couple!,5
"healthy,dogs love it.",5
"Excellent quality, cute and received it fast!

The only problem was the metal ring it came on was very flimsy. It ended up being pulled off her collar and we lost the ID tag.  I purchased another ID tag from here and will buy a stronger ring to hold it on the collar.  Problem fixed!",4
"My cat likes this system and that makes me like it too!  He is been using these for the last four years and it is a very clean, neat and less smelly system than using regular ""old fashioned"" messy cat litter. These were sold at a good deal of a price that beats paying more in retail stores for the exact same product. Also, they deliver rather quickly which is a must requirement because when your cat has gotta go, s/he is gotta go!",5
The cats (both of them) have one of these and it gets a sound thrashing several times a day.  It has been their toy for almost two years and even with the rough playing it looks like new.  GOOD JOB KONG!!!,5
"My dog has  a tendacy to get matted hair and with this comb you can get the tangles out.
None of the other brushes I own worked. When I had her groomed I asked the professional
what he used. He showed me a comb similar to this one. This works because most of the teeth
are course!!!  The other combs I saw had to many fine teeth, Which don't work.. Dog is a Shepard
with fairly long hair.",5
Great,5
"Two are okay (and I mean that loosely) with it, and one is terrified of it. I guess I should have started brushing them at younger ages....",3
"I use this (mini 06226) for my ten gallon aquarium. The quality of the hose anf vaccum seems to be very good for the price. Perfect size and easy to use. The attachment for holding the end of hose is a lifesaver and not all vacs come with them. I would say anyone who has a shorter tank, this is perfect!",5
"Bought these to keep in my dog first aid kit. We hike and backpack a lot, and my 70 lb Golden Lab has torn up his paws a few times, or has cut himself randomly. My friend had these for when her dog tore a paw, and after she bandaged the paw, put this on as a temporary fix. Even though I bought the size the company recommends for a Lab, they are a bit big (maybe a 1/2 inch too big on the sides). However, I think once I wrap his paws with gauze and whatnot, they will fit perfectly.  Glad I bought these - I will feel more prepared for when we go out for adventures.",5
"My dog groomer started using feather bows on my Shih Tzu and I just loved them. The feathers are the only type of dog bows that stay on for long periods of time. I love dressing my little dog up so I bought two cansisters of dog feathers to keep on hand. The feathers hold up well and come in a great variety of colors. I'm getting ready to order another canister for a friend who has two Morkies. The feathers come with  mini rubber bands attached, they are very easy to apply.",5
My cat likes it and uses it to scratch his face quite often.,5
"Revised this from a 5 star down to a 1 star. This worked wonderfully for about 3 months... then started to leak like a sieve.  We tried tightening it, getting it to seal every which way we could.  Nothing would get it to stop leaking and had to end up throwing it away as it was running our floor.  Shame.. I really loved this up until then.",1
"My cats go crazy over these treats! Both have clean breath from enjoying so many treats & actually come to the drawer they're stored in, and standonn hind legs, begging for their treat! It's a great, healthy produce for my cats! They're grateful for them and can't seem to get enough...like candy for a kid!",5
"I bought two of these harnesses for my cats so that I could tether them so they could enjoy the outdoors safely on my balcony. I liked the idea of this harness because it looked comfortable and with cats anything you put on them (especially something uncomfortable) they turn into little escape artists!

Pros: The harness was definitely comfortable enough for my cats to move around freely. My one cat took a liking to the harness because she had no problem walking around (my other cat had issues and refused to walk in it but that was the cats fault more so than the harness). The waste was adjustable so I could somewhat tighten and customize the fit.

Cons: The largest complaint I had for this product was that the small / extra small were still a little too large at the neck (which again isn't really the harnesses fault because they are meant to be used for dogs) however what I didn't like about this is that you could not adjust the neck opening so while you could fit the harness around the waste it was too loose at the neck. I don't think this is specific to cats because my girlfriend brought her small dog over and we had the same problem with him. My bigger con is that it didn't securely fit the cat - while all was well and good the cat didn't struggle to get out of it, but when my cat was spooked by a loud noise, within 2.3 seconds she was out of that harness completely - free and clear! this posed a huge safety issue that really concerned me.

ALL in all - I like the harness and I like the Puppia company a lot - my solution for this was to get a harness made by puppie where you could adjust the neck as well as the waste belt: Puppie RiteFit harness. I will post a review on this one as well!",3
"Useless.  Does not compare to the yellow furminator one at all. I wasn't expecting it to be quite as good as the yellow name brand one, but it doesnt even work for brushing.",1
"My 8 month kitten has tremendously enjoyed this toy!  It has just enough noise to keep him stimulated in play & something about those legs seem to bring out all the best in him.  He can grasp it & kick with back legs also, tosses it high in the air too!  I happen to like it because it is large enough that it doesn't easily get lost underneath all the furniture!!  That's a bonus as I spend far too much time fishing smaller toys out from under stuff.  And I don't know if anyone has this problem, but some stuff never gets found~I am beginning to think there is a black hole that eats kitten toys in my rather small apartment ;-)  I highly recommend this toy, he has many toys & he tires of most, but this one he has come back to again & again for hours of delightful playtime. :)",5
"At the risk of edging into hyperbole, this mane was one of my favorite things I have purchased this year. The quality was excellent and the stitching is holding up well. The actual length of the mane ""sleeve"" is much longer than I was expecting which allows for the mane to bunch up and look very real! With my dog's coloring this mane really makes him look like a little lion, enough that he scared the neighbor boy on accident.

The hair has not yet matted and doesn't seem to bother my dog when he is wearing it (except his brother thinks he's wearing a toy). The only thing that is slightly annoying is the elastic closure, it can be hard to tuck the long string inside the mane after tightening it - but I don't know how they could have gotten around that.",5
"I bought this for my Corgi-sized dog who likes to play soccer, she likes to be the goalie.  The ridges make is so she can pick it up with her mouth.  If I can keep it away from my German Shepherd, it should last a long time.",5
Wellness Complete has kept my indoor cat healthy for years . . .,5
Love this product. Mix it with my dog's food. She loves it too. Helps keep her joints supple. She is 12 years old and getting around fine.,5
"My fish love them. Only give them what they will eat. Within about 12 hours any leftover food will end up on the bottom of the tank and start growing what looks like white mold. If you have any moss in your tank and it starts growing on it, it will ruin your moss. So remove any leftovers.",3
"The first time I put this on her, she was very young, and wondered what it was. She barked and it buzzed, and she stopped to think about what that sound was. then she barked again, and again she hesitated to think about the buzzing. Then she barked again and zap, she yelped out and I was forced by another in the house to take it off.
in the coming weeks, we have varying levels of barking, she barks when she is happy, she barks when she wants food, she barks when she wants to go outside. We then were trying to watch TV and she kept barking. I had played with her all day, and walked her miles.  This was my time and she had to be quiet. I eventually was allowed to put the collar on her. She knew what it was and moaned a little, but laid down and stayed quiet. we took it off when the show was over and took her outside. She knows that the collar means that we want her to be quiet, and she does respect it.",5
Easy to use and does the job without problems.,5
"This coupler works well.  The length (2 ft per link) is just about right.  It allows one of my dogs to do his business while the other one is far enough away to not be involved.  It gets a little annoying because they get tangled every now and then, but I'm sure it happens with all of these couplers.

Of note...my dog chewed through the first one of these that I bought....",5
I got a 8 week old Siberian Huskey and these piddle pads are perfect for her! Luckily she's smart and uses them but even when she does a on the edge pee it seems the pad is so absorbant it pulls most the pee off of the wood floor and back onto the pad. I haven't noticed it leaking through at all. Unless of course she pees on the edge then it gets under. They do not have sticky corners which some people like but I just feel the stickiness gets stuck on the floor after use. I love these just hope I don't have to keep buying them much longer,5
I've used these harnesses before and a new dog chewed his all up and I ordered this one to replace it.  They are comfortable for the dog to wear and they are very secure for the dog.  I'll continue to use this style harness for my dogs.,5
"I switched my Koi and Fancy Gold fish over to this Koi Growth from TetraPond Vibrance because I wanted the extra protein and fat so they would grow faster this summer. But they don't seem to like it as much and eat much less. I have an automatic feeder that I have had to dial way down, I'm not feeding one third of what I was before. They just won't hardly touch this growth food. So are they growing faster? Not!

As soon as this is gone, I will try to find a brand of growth that they like. I guess I will have to spend some time on a Koi forum to see what is working for them.",3
It runs very small,1
okay,3
"I purchased the ""Monkey"" print pajamas for our fur baby. I was worried about sizing and afraid it may be too short. So I purchased a size large. He's a Schnau-Tzu (part miniature Schnauzer & part Shih Tzu). He's short & has a long body like a Shih Tzu. He is only 4 1/2 months old. He weighs about 8 lbs. So the large is a bit long on his body. The bottom will slide down to past where his tail meets his body. I have to pull it up a bit. He sometimes gets his back legs out of the Pj's but not on purpose. It's because he's lounging or napping and it just happens. I probably should have got a size Medium but this is 100% cotton. So I worry it may shrink when washed. I won't put it in the dryer for that reason. He is able to potty perfectly fine without making any mess on the pajamas. These are so cute and very soft. He doesn't act like they bother him at all. They aren't constricting. We noticed he was getting shivers early in the mornings. It's probably because of walking on the cold tile floors so I wanted to try something different from the usual sweaters or those type clothing items. He also hates being under the covers so I had to find something different. This isn't really thick so don't worry about overheating. It's actually sort of tshirt like material. It reminds me of the same type material used for newborn infant pajamas. They are well made; no loose strings, etc. It works for us. He is comfy & so stinking cute. I'm fine with these being a little big so he has room to grow and also just in case they shrink. Definitely recommend these to anyone who has a fur baby who will wear clothes, needs a little extra something for warmth or you just wanna see the cutest thing ever! I've already recommended these to my friends. They are seriously that cute!",5
Love it,5
Cheaper here then anywhere I have looked. Doesn't have a funky smell.,5
"Our otherwise very smart, very trainable shephard would do this one gross thing--recycle his waste which caused gastric distress. We started using S.E.P. and the behavior stopped. We find if we take him off S.E.P. the behavior returns, so we use it every meal. We are pleased.",5
I love it. The only thing that bugs me is it's somewhat of a hassle to get it spread out evenly in the tank but it looks good and fish like it. Eventually I'm thinking about taking some of the pieces off and making another plant out of it,4
"I had read on the package that these were produced by United Pet Group, Division of Spectrum Brands, Inc, Cincinnati, OH
Upon further study of the package, they are indeed made in China although sold by a U.S. company. I have since put them in the trash. Sorry for the confusion!",1
"My puppy LOVES this ball! He has both the animal sounds and the talking ball, and he chases them both around and plays with them daily. It is so fun to watch! They do sound a little annoying, but when you watch your puppy play with them you totally won't notice or mind. They both work perfect and make sound every time he pushes and rolls them.",5
These worked great until my puppies started eating them.,3
The best food ever.,5
"This was a ""sweet"" treat for my dogs versus their usual meaty treats, but they sure seemed to enjoy it.  Couldn't help snacking on it myself.  I consider this more or less an occasional ""sweet treat"" for my poochies.",5
"I have a 40 gallon long tank and this covers a good portion of it. It has about a  4"" block on both sides that doesn't shine light. My turtles became much happier when I got them this longer uvb light mixed with a basking lamp. The one I ordered came with the bulb as well.",5
Bought these for my parents elderly cat (17 years!). She was having trouble jumping up onto the couch to cuddle with them so rather than watch her struggle not she just walks up the steps. They're quite sturdy and don't take up a lot of room. Easy to move out of the way if needed and were very easy to assemble.,5
"Very sturdy and secure.  My dog wasn't kennel trained when he was a puppy, but learned with this one i purchased.",5
Excellent product that provides a quick freshening of your dog's coat.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  We'll definitely be purchasing more of this!,5
My cats love this condo so much. Worth every penny I paid. They play and sleep on it all the time,5
"Works exactly as expected with my Sport Dog 1875 remote.  I needed to add my second dog and this was the best solution.  Programmed so that the toggle switch position determines which dog is receiving a beep correction.  I would have given a 5 star rating, but the on/off button on this collar is extremely hard to work.",4
Soft and fluffy....pup loves it in her bed.,5
cats are happy,5
Well made & great warranty.,5
"I did a ""controlled"" experiment, usung this product in two of our four litter boxes. Swapped the boxes from place to place. My cats showed no preference for the boxes containing the product.",2
Great product for my dog's coat,5
Quiet and powerful,5
"My dog sometimes skips meal for whatever reason and won't eat also he does not always chew his food but gulps it down. It got this to help him slow down when he eats and to encourage him to eat. I have used it 3 times thus far and he has eaten each time from it. Sometimes I have to entice him by leaving food outside the flapper but it works. When he is finished he will sniff around for more, in case a piece got left behind. Also, I am glad to find out my dog is not dumb as he figured it out. I could see however this not being the best fit for a dog with a wide or flat muzzle. My dogs muzzle seems to fit perfectly in. Unless there is something I did not figure out, it would be nice if there was a central way to put in the food. You can put it into the flapper but not the most efficient way. My housemate said it looked like a Hungry Hippo game.",4
"I think the water tube is too short. Also is not good for reptiles habitat other that a fish tank. I can not use it, unless I make a hole in the cage's screen. If anyone has a good idea of how to insert it into the cage, I will appreciate.",3
"My senior Cockapoo seems to always be hot and I have struggled to keep her cool without freezing my family and me! She LOVES this pad. In fact, I bought another one. She now has one on the bed for night and one in the den for day. She AND her family are comfortable!! Oh yeah, I use a pillow case on them!",5
"Our dog (13 lb corgi/sheltie) loves these, and I like them because they're fairly easy to break into little pieces so I'm not filling her full of treats when we're working on training. A small heads up: these definitely have an odor to them.",5
Great aqua soul. My plants and fish love it and it stays clean and doesn't produce a lot of silt.,5
"This seems to be a decent quality food, but none of my cats will eat it. I have seven (go ahead and call me the crazy cat lady) rescue cats and the bowl has sat untouched. Usually my fat orange tabby, OJ, gobbles up any new food with gusto before the other cats can get a taste, but even he isn't impressed (and he dumpster dives in the kitchen trash anytime a kid forgets to close the pantry door....so not picky). I'm considering mixing it with their usual food (Blue Buffalo), but I worry they'll stop eating that too.

The ingredients seem ok, but the cinnamon threw me. That is one of the main ingredients in most sprays sold to deter cats from scratching or spraying. So, to me, it doesn't make sense to put it in their food.

I wouldn't recommend not buying this food. It is better than many you'll find at your grocery store, but be aware picky (and not picky) eaters might turn up their noses.",3
"Just a warning to others, make sure the transformer is not on carpet. I have the 48inch model running in 24/7 mode. The transformer got hot enough to singe my carpet.",1
It does the job.,5
used this before and it is great and a better price than others that claim to do the same thing but dont,5
"it worked well, but i wish i had bought the diffuser instead. this is really just for traveling or carriers or really small areas i think. if you need for for any average sized room get the diffuser, so worth the money.",5
"Awesome deal compared to similar ones at the pet store.  Kitten is in love, and have only used one so far.  He did manage to pull one leg off, but it is still useable and he is still entertained.  Nice that there are 2 more waiting to be used.",4
My dog loves this.  He took to it immediately.,5
Bought with PetSafe Drinkwell Platinum Fountain. Works very well,5
Worked for what needed but I think even though the size was good my border collies head wasn't heavy enough to make it bend. It held her head at an odd angle making her more cranky.  Not real comfy for her.,4
For some reason my dogs aren't interested in this ball.,3
"When I got this pet dish in the mail, it was exactly what I was looking for. SUPER 'girly' :) and excellent quality. The perfect size for my 6 lb Chihuahua. It doesn't slip around on the pet mat and the bowls can be removed for easy cleaning. I would highly recommend - It's ADORable and fits my furbaby perfectly. Thank you!!!!",5
"More comfortable due to its design, wears well.  This is our second harness from Puppia.",5
"This is great with the length, and it's heavier duty than the one we replaced with it.",5
A must have for ferrets,5
Great for throwing the ball far.,5
This is good stuff.,5
"My cat has every toy in the book and he loves wand style interactive toys. I was excited when I found this. However, he was not. It's just too big for him to enjoy  :( it's too big for him to fit in his mouth, so he tends to just look at it and not chase it. Oh well.",3
On my Irish Setter the color looks amazing!! Love the turtles!! These collars are made strong and I have bought several!,5
"Once you get this on your dog and are ready to go, it works well. However, if you let go for a second it will slide right off the dog. And is a bit of a pain to get back on.",3
Wills loves it,5
May be well made but my two dogs wouldn't touch it.  I gave it away.,3
Great! our very destructive gerbil let this live the longest of any houses she's had!,5
"My dog personally doesnt like them, however have them to friend and her dogs loved it",4
this is awesome your dogs will not loose their tags unless they lose the whole collar.  it is not designed to be a quick change out  tag holder if you want to switch collars allot but it can be done fairly quickly.,5
This harness is incredibly small.  The circumference is six inches not the diameter and it is has no give. Would not fit an 8-week old 9 pound puppy. This would only fit very tiny dogs or teacup dogs.,3
It opens almost with one hand and folds very easily to fit into the trunk of my Honda Acord. The quality is excellent. Great buy.,5
Works like a charm on dog and cat food!,5
This is a great price for this food ($18.99 at the time) and the free shipping is awesome. This particular type of Eukanuba is hard to find in the stores anymore. I was glad to see it on Amazon.,5
This stuff really works.  I can tell when we run out because the cats get aggressive toward one another.,5
Apparently these were reformulated a number of years ago and are now useless according to my vet.  Thanks for letting us know.  I wish I hadn't wasted so much money.  They clearly have not been effective,1
I have a cat that needs two of these each day - one at each meal so this was a great price. Thank you!,5
"This cat toy holds the attention of an elderly cat which is sometimes not the case.  She is quite picky with her toys and am glad to see that she is getting some exercise with this one.

I think it is the fact that there is some 'spring' in it and she likes to push it along the floor.

Will buy from this company in the future.

Highly recommended.",4
Great - as described - helps our dog - thank you!,5
"I got 2 of these sweeties a few months ago and I LOVE THEM!! They not only eat some algae and leftovers but they EAT BETTA POOP! Well mine are anyways. I have 2 in with my male butterfly betta and they have shorter tentacles so it's not as easy for a nippy fish to nip at them as it is for other snails. If they do get nipped though, I would recommend moving them because they will become shy and not as active if they feel threatened. They are so very interesting to watch as they move around their shells. They seem SO strong! We love ours.",5
Wonderful smell.  It's the ONLY thing that has worked to get the urine out of my hardwood floors.,5
This helps control the amount of kitty litter that gets on our floors outside the litter box. It doesn't prevent sprinkles of litter 100% but really helps out a lot.,4
"2 treatments and it did absolutely nothing, total waste of money, feel ripped off. Seller glued a label on the bottom of the box, thinking that is where the expiration was.",1
"My dogs are not fans, Golden and Poodle.",3
"I was buying from my vet. The price is a little better here, my dogs love them only whish they were grain free. We use these as pill pockets when necessary. Very good product.",5
Not for little dogs.,3
"Changed my beardie to this from walnut substrate. He doesn't seem to mind the change. I have it in a 60 gallon tank and had to buy 2 of these, cut about 1.5""  off lengthwise and add about a foot of the second carpet to fit. Easy cleanup, no nail snagging and he can't eat it.",5
"this is the brand the shelter recommended when I adopted a 4yr old second-chance deformed dog who's time was up.  after buying 10-15 diff brands of dry food, I give up.  he won't touch this or any other dry food.  strange, because dry is all he was offered as he spent most of his life going from shelter to shelter.  he must have been eating some of it, but was quite underweight when I saved him.
am giving it a 4, convinced this is good food.  the ingredients, being grain free, no food coloring, coming recommended by experts.  affordable.  I had such high hopes, but is not nature's recipe's fault that he refuses dry food altogether.",4
"I tried one box initially but now order it on a regular basis.  I feed many cats and when I sprinkle this on their canned food, they lick the bowls clean!  I will continue to buy this item.",5
"Love them. Roomy, durable, eco safe, fun :)",5
It works great!,5
"My dog liked the treats and they all are gone.  The price, compare to the stores, was very reasonable.  Thank you.",4
Hard to give pills anyway but these help out.  They do get used to them though and tend to resist sometimes so you can't always fool them into taking their meds.,4
My cat loves this bed. It's super soft!,5
"We use it cover our futon where our furry child likes to snooze and people-watch! Does not move around too much with the dog, in the sense it stays put mostly. Washes well too",4
"Arrived very quickly, haven't tried it on the new kitten yet, but I think it will be fine. Great ingredients so it will be healthy for him.",5
"My lab mix is 90lbs (!), so we got the xl bed for him. He's never really slept on his own, but he's been waking me up for years and it was time to get him to sleep on his own. This bed is huge and just big enough for him to stretch out on. I've finally gotten him to actually stay in it all night, and now when I get up in the morning he's still snoring away in his giant bed. I'm happy he likes it, and I seriously hope it stands the test of time cause it's too expensive to buy again.",5
Excellent but I had a lot of leftover parts we didn't need...or at least we didn't think we needed!,5
great,5
Very good fit.  Glad it does not have the fuzzy material around the nose to collect dirt and stickers from the brush/,5
"High Quality, good value, dogs love.",5
"Has some problems. Overall quality is 'iffy' and it is not precision engineered. The motor and its intake are not consistent. It has a tendency to somehow get air into the system and becomes VERY loud. There are overflow issues as well so have had to turn power down lower to avoid overflow and obnoxious noise. Look elsewhere, there are MANY higher quality products out there. I'd suggest a canister and an inline UV filter.",2
These work very well.,5
"I had to go through this food bit by bit because my parrot needed specific food. The pellets, which are the only ly thing with vitamins, were hard as rocks. The ones that looked like thick cornflakes couldn't even be broken.  I advise better pellets. There were a few peanuts, lots of inedible wheat, and dyed safflower. Maybe I received an old stale bag? The pellets smelled awful, no wonder my bird turned from them. I hate to say it but Walmart brand is fresher and cheaper.",3
"these have worked well for our yorkie. no more marking or ""accidents"" in the house.",5
Not sure if it's working.... don't have time to use it everyday like instructions say.,3
"The first ingredient is chicken.  The next five ingredients are Brewers Rice, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose, Wheat Gluten, and Whole Grain Wheat.  Now what do you think there's more of in this bag -- chicken or cheap carbohydrates that an obligate carnivore shouldn't be eating?  I was offered a bag of this food for free and I wouldn't accept it.  You shouldn't either.",1
Birds not crazy about it.,3
Great fits my yorkie perfect,4
"The cats that live in my house found the bag and ate most of the treats. But from what my dog had, she seemed to enjoy it and it didn't upset her allergies like many treats can.",4
"quick del, their ok, would be a lot better if they were tablets so they could be broke in half.",3
"The only food my little 8 yr old girl will eat, In fact it is all she eats. She has even lost a few pounds. Which is a good thing.",5
Very well made for those of us who have little destroyer dogs.,5
Perfect!,5
"I've been using this product for a year on my Shihtzu, to keep his hair from breaking.  I wanted a product that didn't shed the dog when used, a lot of the products think you need assistance de-shedding your pup.  I don't want to shed my pup, I want him to keep his hair.  This product helps him to keep his hair, not shed it. With Just Devine his coat stays fuller and there is a lot less hair in the brush and comb, very little comes out.  He doesn't mat a lot, over the years of using great products it's almost as if his hair is trained not to mat. He's 9 and I've been using Chris Christensen shampoo and conditioner #10 since he was a puppy, along with some other products. I brush and comb him once a week and he's good to go.  I like the shampoo #10 and conditioner, hydro pac conditioner, and the Just Devine.  It does not make my Shih Tzu hair Shiny, its a wet spray.  It does help with breakage and detangling.  Less hair in the brush and comb.  The After Bath is the only crme rinse I have found fit for a long hair Shih Tzu.",5
"Update: it eventually lasted a little over a year. The fountain stopped working. You have to buy filters for it, which added to the price. Still nice, but that's my end of the life of the product impression.

Easy setup. My cat was immediately attracted to it. Instantly curious. This was recommended to me by my vet because my cat needs to drink more water. It gives your cat three different ways to drink. And I like the soothing way it sounds, it's not so loud that it would frighten your cat.

She now sleeps next to it haha!",4
Chinny yum yums!,5
Works great and just the right size to hold down my Eheim filter hoses.,5
This lasted 12 days longer than the paper fluff from petco! Completely impressed.,5
"Not as substantial as the other two that I ordered.  I have an ""all breeds"" dog rescue and give these to my foster families that don't have a doggie door.  Great gift and super training tool.",4
"My dog can chase a ball for hours, but unfortunately the family doesn't last that long. I was originally skeptical about this, but I had seen someone at the park with one and thought I would give it a try. It does take a few times to figure out the ideal launch, but after that this works like a charm. My young children are able to join in the fun now too. The added bonus is how the launcher will retrieve the slimy ball without my having to touch it.",5
"Very helpful loading dogs into my car. Ramp is light, wide enough, not too bulky and easy to set up.",5
"My dog has not paid any attention to this toy.  An antler, which was bought later, has been her go to chew of choice.  Antlers are expensive, but when you look at the money spent on toys that are ignored and those that are torn to pieces, they are a bargain.",2
So cute on the puppy.,5
My senior boy loves this stuff and it's come in handy during times of illness & him not wanting to eat!,5
"I bought this for my boston terrier, who was itching a lot at his ears, and started getting little crusties.  After using them 2x a day for 2 days Ziggy's ears are velvety smooth!  Very happy I purchased it.",5
Way to much vibration. Mount is a very poor design. But I guess you get what you pay for.,1
One of my dogs I rescued had bad teeth. He had one pulled out 2 years ago. But his breath still smells so bad especially in the morning. I started using this antiseptic oral gel on him and the bad breath have dramatically decrease.,5
Cat likes it,5
Never miss an old stain or spot again!,5
It's hard to know if the product works or not because the spray bottle is defective and won't spray properly.  I tried to make it work over and over and finally gave up.,2
I bought this brand harness in both small and medium. Neither fit correctly even though my little guy is 13 lb. They weren't too small neccissarily but just had a strange fit.,3
"This is a great sampler of bones for small dogs. My puppy loves to chew on the blue bone and toss it around the house. She hasn't tried the clear one yet, but I am sure that will be a hit too. The only downside is the brown, edible bone doesn't last long enough. She ate it within a few minutes. I was hoping it would occupy her for a little longer. Also, these really are small, so consider a bigger size if your dog is a strong chewer.",4
"fits the DY omni feeder perfectly , easy to mount and remove for washing . the birds like it and so long as no doves or squirrels set the feder swinging wildly to and fro , the tray contains seed hulls very well .",5
This catnip toy does not get NEAR the attention that my cat gives to the Yeowww banana.  I guess she just loves bananas.  I wouldn't buy again.,2
My 3 fur babies love this treat.,5
Love the colors and price/quantity.  Only problem is that they are very thin and you pretty much have to use two together.,3
"Haven't used this very long, so not sure if it will help my dog's mild allergy and anal gland issue, but easier to use than what the vet suggested for a probiotic, and I like the ingredients better. My dog eats grass a lot, so I am hoping the ingredients in this might help reduce that tendency. I know a little about health (read a lot), so I chose this one due to ingredients and that it is a smaller company.",5
"Feed only NB, dry and canned. Use the roll and hard treats also. Great product. Will use nothing else with my dogs. Keep them really healthy.",5
The leg broke and I had to glue it.,3
"I'm an experienced cat owner and have always brushed my cats, but trying to remove shedding hair from your cat with this particular brush is like trying to rake leaves with a rake that has 6-inch gaps between its tines!

I stepped on and broke my old cat brush. I bought this ""Safari Cat Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush"" because it looked like a good replacement and had good reviews, but that is where the ""good"" ends. Using it quickly revealed major design flaws that makes it virtually useless for removing shed hair.  As you can see in the attached photo, all its bristles are arranged in single-file rows running the same direction as the grooming stroke. Worse, there are huge 1/8"" gaps between each row, much too wide to effectively capture shedding hair. As a result, the majority of the loose cat hair just slips right between the bristle rows and remains on the cat no matter how many strokes you give it.

I wrote this review to help prevent others from making the same mistake in purchasing this brush as I did. Do yourself - and your cat - a favor, instead of wasting your money on this push-button,"" self-cleaning"" wonder, forget all the gimmicks and ergonomics bologna and look for a simple brush with greater bristle density and a more staggered alignment, a design that can actually capture loose cat hair while brushing.",1
Best food for Dogs,5
Definitely the top bone in the market. My frenchie loves it on its own or with a little bit of peanut butter on it. Highly recommended !!!,5
Love the color and fit. Connections are good.,5
Dog wasn't crazy about it!,3
$110 for the liter box. They won't adjust your charge probably any sooner then debit your account!,1
Works great and love it being so much lighter to carry.....,5
This has been hours of fun for my puppy.,5
it don't work,2
Both of my dogs favorite toy!,5
wonderful and great quality not cheaply made.,5
"I have a Doggone Good treat pouch that I really like, but I wanted to try one like this that I could cinch up completely. My biggest complaint is that on the first use, the drawstring got caught in the toggle and is shredded. Now it's very difficult to open and close, which makes it very similar to the one I already have. My second complaint is that the clip is very flimsy. It fell off twice while running agility, spilling treats thanks to the fact that I can't close it anymore.",1
It's what the vet prescribed but my dog is not wild about it. I have to doctor it up to get him to eat it.,3
Fabulous!,5
Bought these pads hoping it would help train my puppy. She peed everywhere except on the bullseye.. It did not release a pleasant odor and it leaked under the pad.,1
This will be our second time purchasing the spade set. Our first one lasted several years and we found that for our large dogs this worked much better the the rake set.,5
"Good quality, works as expected",5
"Our dog loves all e Kong crackle toys! This one in particular, she goes crazy for!",5
"These treats can not be found easily in the stores where I live. I have subscribed to receive a case of these every month for my 3 dogs. They love them and it keeps the smaller dogs busy for some time.
The only con is the thickness of the chews. Some are like boot soles and since the boxes are by weight, you don't get as many chewies in a box with the thick ones as you do with the skinnier ones. I give the thick ones to my German Shepherd.",5
very good,5
Such a lovely addition!,5
This works great for my fish tank.,5
"cat uses it - but the interior is too small. The decorative doors just make for allowing cold air in, and it has 3 levels.. a 2 level with a slightly better room would be better.  For me - I got it dirt cheap (lower than I've seen it lately) so it's ""good enough"".  My cat barely fits inside - he's a 9 lb male orange tabby.",3
"If one can feel love for a poop bag, then I'm in love.  Warning - probably TMI if you read further.  I had been using the old standard - sandwich bags and then putting them in a plastic shopping bag.  I hated putting them out in trash - first the smell and second knowing they would just sit in some landfill somewhere.  I have three big dogs - two Weimaraner's and a Great Dane - so you can imagine the mess I have to clean up each day.  I first ordered a different companies biodegradable bag and the bags themselves were nice and thick but I hated having to try to twist and tie the top - not to mention trying to get them out of the little pouch or torn off the roll (the Pogi's are also wider which is a must with big dogs).  I decided to give Pogi's Easy Tie a try and I will never go back.  Some reviewers mention the thinness of the bag but I really don't find that an issue.  I'm sure if you were someone with long fingernails, this might pose a problem but for me they work great.  The size is big and wide enough to grab two poop piles in one bag, turn it upside down again and still have plenty of room left to tie the handles.  It's also nice to just hang them on your fingers and move to the next pile instead of dropping them in the yard to just have to go back and pick them up again.  I am lucky enough to have the woods surround my home so I can just toss them over my fence and wait for them to degrade instead of having to drop them in the trash - they do start out with a fresh scent but that doesn't really last very long.  All in all, I will continue to purchase these over and over again.",5
Dog broke it within 2 days.,2
Exactly what I wanted and fits perfect,5
"My elderly dogs love, love, love these pads. I have noticed my ""handicapped"" dachshund seems to walk better since he has spent time lying on these pads daily.
Updated June 18, 2016: One pad has quit heating as quickly and as warm as the second pad.",5
This head collar works.  I'll give it that.  We have a smaller mixed breed dog who pulled like crazy and since I have experience with the Halti brand I decided to try this one.  I measure our boy out and got the small size.  We were excited when it came but we were disappointed.  While the neck size is perfect the mouth size was the next size up.  He can't fully open his mouth to yawn.  When he did the little clip popped off.  He has room to drink and pant which is why we will continue to use it until I can find a better Halti version of it.  I like how it's made.  It's durable and I really like how the nose is padded vs Halti which is not.  I like the option to reduce the muzzle part when needed but again that's to small as it is.  I'm sure this product will work perfect for some just not our boy.,3
great for catching dogs attention for photos!,5
"Nice litterbox, cat has used it without problem since day 1. Took the door off because it came off too easily.",5
"I've tried other liquids that usually end up making a mess b/c my dogs don't like being fed medicine. I bought this via my vet once (at a ridiculous price) and not only is it super easy to use but IT WORKS often after one dose, sometimes two. My dogs love this b/c it taste like peanut butter so they think it's a treat. For the occasional bout of diarrhea this works like a charm.",5
"They're cheap and they work, I will acknowledge that. However, I have to swap these batteries out every 3 or 4 days on my dog's bark collar, which is somewhat frustrating. I had hoped for more longevity, but they get the job done and that's what counts. I bought the bark collar for my girl because she's had some inappropriate barking that we haven't been able to curb with other means. The batteries last for 3 or 4 days (long enough for her to respond better to verbal cues to be quiet) and then I have to swap them out.",3
Better than the cones they have in the vets office. Only con is that the edge of the cone seems to be peeling off and I've only used this about 3 times. The stretchy loops attach to your pets collar.,4
this thing is huge...I have never seen a scoop this big before.  but with it being metal it's great for scraping for the cats that like to pee right on the pan so the litter sticks to the bottom really bad.,5
Makes the kitties CRAZY!!!! Have ordered and re-ordered because they love it a little too much!,5
Zoey is now 4 yes old and she had a horrible skin reaction to most shampoos and this was recommended by our daughter. She stays clean longer no more rash and love the scent..,5
"First off, the item arrived unbelievably fast. Much faster than I expected. So props to the seller for the fast shipping.

The collar itself was everything I hoped it would be and more. The fabric is very thick and beautiful. The design is great. The last collar I had broke after about a year because the plastic snap together buckle broke. I can't see this collar breaking any time soon. There is simply no way it can break. The material is thick like a seat belt, possibly thicker.

I am so happy with this collar. My baby boy looks good too!",5
Best pup food out there,5
"My box turtle seems to only think it is ok. I bought this to boost her appetite, but it is only working a little.",3
"These are really little birdies and my dogs love to carry them around in their mouths - shaking them occasionally to 'kill' them.  They are about the size of a real bird and a great substitute for the dogs actually hunting birds in the yard.  They seem very proud of them selves when they 'catch' one of these and I don't get any yucky presents left on the steps.  (Or worse, in the house!)  The hold up really well, too.  I love Kyjen toys!  And I will never buy another Kong stuffy - the dogs (especially my WFT) tear them apart in minutes.",5
"Thanks to the maker of this product
Worked better then all the VET products.",5
Is very sturdy but the handle is too long and aggravates my carpal tunnel syndrome in my right hand.,3
"My little Dachshund likes this toy so much! She pulls off the fuzz to get to the squeeker, but I order another new one... I have even sewed them up!  She loves it when UPS delivers boxes. She gets so excited, she's hoping for another! We must have ordered this ten times! Love them!",5
My 5 and 68 lbs dogs use a LARGE and it works great. They have not tore them up.,5
"Oh my gosh, where's the carpet shampooer!?! I thought we were fairly clean people, but when I used this on my living room carpet in the dark, I nearly got sick. You can see every place that our super mouse-killer cat has brought a mouse into the house and eaten it. And you can see every place where our runt kitty has barfed and we thought we had cleaned it up.
It works too well! I guess we'll be doing some shampooing real soon!

I'd be scared to use this in a motel...

The glasses are a nice touch - easier on your eyes, and they turn the purple light into a more neutral color.

My biggest surprise was that it's not terribly bright in the visible spectrum. I bought this one because it had 51 LEDS compared to the 6 LED one I already had, but I don't think this one shows up any more than twice as bright as the smaller one. We took this out into the forest on a moonless night a (for fun) ghost hunt. I thought this light might allow we to see critters, or signs of critters in the woods, but it didn't seem to cast that far. Although, when it picks up something that it makes glow, it can be seen well. We found a couple of small millipedes that lit up light Christmas tree bulbs under this light. Saw these 1"" beasties glowing on the trail from 20+ feet away, but I was surprised that that was about all we saw in the first that lit up.",4
"dogs name is Khaleesi,  so she had to have a dragon.  carries it everywhere
very cute",5
"This product contains mostly pellets that turn the aquarium water a red color.  Very, very few treats.",1
Works great,4
"I have a little female cat this is all she eats plus her dry food. She has always been a picky eater she only likes up the sauce, my other cats come and polish off the rest. I ordered 3 boxes off this and 2 pouches were bloated when I open them up you can tell they were bad, could have given my cat food posoining. Beware off the bloated bags!!!!!",4
"UPDATE:  BEWARE!!!!  Some of these straps are not sewn well - always pull the rings to test the stitching.  Still okay for the cost.

These have been great so far for our rescue pets and it gives me a lead to give away.  I have not had any breaks and they seem very secure, even on larger dogs.  I did read about others' experiences with some of them breaking so just for some added security, I decided to use two leads on the larger dogs.  I wish there was some type of slide to keep it from getting too loose.

It is not great for some of the dogs who pull too hard because it seems to choke them more than a thicker lead or collar would.

Overall, I am very satisfied with these leads and will likely order again.",4
They're actually fine clippers but they're too big for a housecat.  Maybe if you have an ocelot or Bengal cat they'd be OK but for ordinary cats and small dogs they're just too big - you could snip off a whole toe with these.,3
My cat loves being brushed with this and the hair comes off so easily!,5
Lots of treats in this bag -- enough for a stable of happy horses.  Your horse will be grateful for this purchase.,5
Delicious treats so my dog has told me.  She loves them,5
Rehydrates very quickly.  My dogs love it as part of their raw food diet.,5
Smell is pleasant and dog loves it! I use it everyday to wipe her down from our walks. It's also great for refreshing the fur  it picks up a lot of dead hair!,5
great tube selection,5
Holy cow - more than a year later 2 of the chicks are still in tact!  Many toys due not end up this way between 3 dogs.,5
"Our kitty loves these, prob made in China, not too durable",5
Love it.  The only thing I use when walking my dog.  Easy to put on and no need for a collar and etc.  just slip it over her head and off you go.,5
I bought 2 of these -- one for my dog and one for  my niece's dog.  My dog is not crazy about it but my niece's dog loves it.  He is one of those dogs who chews everything and this toy is lasting!  He got it Christmas and it looks like new almost 2 months later.,5
Our 9 month old German Shepherd loves these.  These are probably his favorite of all of the things we have tried.  These last him maybe 15 minutes or so.  We have not had any issues with the smell from this package.,5
"Easily folds flat to store in my storm closet, has a handy carry bag with a shoulder strap.  When open it is big and roomy for my ~60 lb girl, Suki.  We've not had an occasion to take it on a trip or outdoors yet, but it looks rugged enough to handle pretty much anything.",5
"I ordered these all natural chicken jerky treats for my dogs when my usual supplier stopped making their favorite treats. I don't give them any treat that is not USA sourced and produced, and that is not all natural, so these were an easy choice.

When the package arrived, I was surprised at how large and full it was. Having ordered many jerkies before and gotten only a little for a big price, this one was a very welcome surprise. My dogs love this jerky! And I can give it to them with no worries I am giving them anything unhealthy, a guilt-free treat they get every day.

The jerky pieces are both large and small - the photo with the ruler are some small pieces at the bottom of my first package, I just reordered. Even the small pieces are very substantial.

This jerky is not  a disappointment and I highly recommend it for dogs of all sizes (mine are Chihuahuas). You can easily cut the pieces into smaller if you need to for toy breeds.",5
"I have a neighbor with barking dogs.  My dog doesn't bark, but when they bark, he will eventually join in.  I placed this 2 feet from our neighbor's fence, and I installed it 7-8 ft up, so that it could peer over the fence at the neighbor's dogs.  The neighbor's dogs, as loud as they are, do not trigger the device.  My dog, when he barks, triggers the device, 1 out of every 3-4 times.  When he did trigger it, there was an immediate change in his demeanor... I don't think he liked it.  But because it was so infrequent, no dog learns anything.  I imagine, that if my dog was the barker, and I installed it at around my dog's height, he would trigger it and stop barking.",2
Bought this for an abandoned cat we have been taking care of for more than 10 yrs. He has some kind of painful mouth illness. This seems to have helped him. His mouth does not seem to be as painful. Easy to use and he likes it.,5
Good harness the large fit my 80# pit dogo.mix.,5
"My dog loves this! It's a great way to get her to exercise right in our backyard when she still has energy after our walk. I have a 5 year old GSD. At first, she wasn't interested but I didn't give up and eventually she couldn't stop chasing it. Now I use it to play with her u til she gets tired and lays down.",5
"Great for our pup with dog/person anxiety, who is learning to be loose leash trained. We saw immediate results and though it came with an instructional dvd, the directions in the packaging were plenty.",5
"I don't like the fit of this harness.  I have two large dogs.  One pulls and has a no pull harness that makes walking him so much easier.  I bought them this harness for the safety belt feature, hoping it could also be their walking harnesses.  I fitted harnesses and took them for a walk. It was not pretty.  The pulling dig was in way more control that I liked.  I will have to look at adjustments again to see if I've done something wrong.  This harness is more complicated than the ones I've used.  I do have to take them to the vet next month, so will let you know how the seatbelt feature works.  I have attached the seat belt strap to their regular harnesses and like the added control of a short handle.  While walking them I can keep the close when approached by other dogs.",3
"We bought two of these beds a little over three years ago. They are the best dogs beds weve ever had, and weve had a lot, both cheaper and much, much more expensive. The covers wash well and have held up nicely. A new addition to the home has chewed up one of the covers, and rather than having to replace the entire bed for full price, they offer replacement covers for much less cost. I highly recommend this product. Its well worth the money.",5
"I admit this was my fault. I bought 2 of the 24-36 thinking it would cover 72"" of light.so I just purchased 2 36-48 which will be perfect.can I send back the 2 24""-36"" for a refund if not I will sell them to someone.give me a break at least I upgraded",5
Wrinkely,3
My geriatric cat does not use the scratcher but does like the 'cave'. I like the style and size; it blends in much better than a large bulky cave does. I'm thinking of buying another one.,5
"First time purchase of these, and they are a great hit with my cat.  I love that they are healthy for her, while it's something she goes nuts for.  I had forgotten 2 of them in my robe pocket one evening.  I got up the next morning, and kitty had my robe and had been chewing on the pocket to get at them (she must have finally figured out how to get them from inside the pocket).  I won't be forgetting these in any of my pockets anymore.  LOL  She's had other treats she likes a whole lot, but nowhere near how she reacts for these. :-)",5
"This bed has lasted (and is still good) for a year with our Busy as she has grown from a pup to a year old. It is still as good as it was the day we received it. She enjoys curling up on it and is comfortable while in her crate with it. In fact we liked the quality so much we purchased another one for our 2nd Husky. It is easy to clean and maintain. We have had other beds that our dogs have gone through that have not lasted a full year and maintained their quality like this one. I would recommend this bed, particularly for inside a crate for any dog out there.",5
"Really love this, does a much better job getting the undercoat on my Pembroke Corgi.",5
He loves this food and I am glad I can afford to give him the best.,5
My 100lb German Shepherd (GS) maintains very well on this high protein blend. Canines require high protein and this food is a great choice for that. Blu my GS is six years old and has been on this food for five of those years. He is allergic to chicken and it is difficult to find any dog treats or foods without any chicken ingredients. This food is a complete nutritious blend without any chicken. I feed Blu approximately 1cup and a quarter 2 times a day. He maintains weight with that anything more he will gain pounds. Since he has a compromised hip from a fall I can't have Blu gain weight.,5
"The first one my dog received as a gift only lasted a few days.  We replaced the batteries and it still did not work.  We ordered this one.  I will update if this one dies on us.  I thought I was getting the same ball with words.  This one only has ANIMAL SOUNDS.  Be mindful, it makes our dog bark a lot, but he has fun.  I can only tolerate it in spurts.",3
"Great dog food especially if your dog has allergies.  While it didn't cure her scratching entirely, I did see a big improvement.  My dogs love the flavor and I'm happy they are getting a high quality food.",5
my cats love this stuff,5
"Looks like teddy grahams, tread carefully ;)",5
Great collar for walking at night or just letting dog out in yard. You always know where they are.,5
Unlike other poop bags these tear apart easily and the best part is they're earth friendly.,5
Dogs bark anyway.,1
Works well on my cats!,5
Brush works as it should.  Nothing fancy.,5
This cleans my dog's ears gently and effectively.,5
I have an Alaskan Malamute that constantly had mats.  The groomer tried to trimmer her so that she would start fresh but that didn't work.  Nothing I tried did until I bought this.  Not only does it work but it doesn't pull and she likes it.  The best for dogs with undercoats.,5
Cats love it. They all have silky soft coats. I blend it with Purina Pro and supplement with Purina Fancy Feast.,5
Cats favorite,5
"My German Shepard hates this!  When he's not shaking his head trying to get it off, it works great but personally it wasn't for us.",3
"My dog is obsessed with these treats! I love that they are made in the USA too! My dog, a 6 month old yellow lab got  diarrhea from these treats I got her at Petco. I wanted to find her something healthy, natural, and affordable! I will never stop buying my pup these treats, it gives me comfort knowing she's eating something that I know is quality!",5
"I use this stuff with my breeze litter system and I find the pellets to be comparable in quality, but a much different experience. Both are great in terms of odor control, no question. The other is neutral and this one has a woodsy smell and both are good with absorbing odors. While the other pellets are white and remain whole even after being urinated on, the blue buffalo pellets disintegrate with moisture, falling through the grates of the breeze system and onto the pee pad. I like this because it helps manage odor even better. You will notice what looks like dirt on the pee pad as a result. Since these are a brown color, I think it looks a bit better than the white (breeze pellets) with the feces just sitting there until it can be scooped up. This + the breeze box and pads + the litter genie = a winning combination for this cat lady!",5
"This is good for your cat regardless if it is experiencing digest upset or diarrhea.
My cats love the taste and come running when they hear me tear open the packets.",5
"My gerbil loves this thing! It takes him a week or two to finish it, but he's happy the whole time. Keeps his teeth nice and short, and it's a nice treat for him. He even eats the milo seed, which he normally hates.",5
Did not work,1
Very good size for cockatiels even,5
"this particular shampoor was recommended bu the pet groomer so I looked on Amazon and grabbed a couple bottle for a great price. Unforunately, One of the bottles came cracked and had leaked all over the box and other items within the box. I have yet to see the replacement ship",5
"The first time my cat jumped on the perch it shifted and scared her.  Since I didn't want her to be scared of using the scratching post I removed the perch.  The problem with the perch is that it is not a tight fit.  Two little plastic tabs prevent the perch from sliding off completely but do not hold it firmly in place.  I thought of wedging something inside to make it more sturdy but since my cat likes to climb the post like a tree and the overhang of the perch made that awkward for her, I just put the perch back in the box.
The little potholder cushion on the top of the perch isn't the greatest either but since I removed the perch so quickly I can't really say how that would have held up.",2
"The fragrance it claims to have is too weak.  I can't really smell anything after washing my dogs with this shampoo.
However it does rinse off really well.",3
"These clog too quickly for me, to the point that my filter can't really move water. I use it on an AC20, and the filter comes to a trickle within a couple of weeks. It's annoying.",2
I have mixed results. I bought four for my cats when I went on vacation. At first the refused to use and I am still trying to train them with mixed success. The ones that work are great but one of them does not turn to new settings.,3
"This is my 2nd one, so I have a backup if this gets lost. I have a Sheltie, which are pretty tricky about slipping out of collars. It tightens down when he backs up and wants to wiggle free. Which he does since doing it in a regular collar, and even a harness. I use this and he is getting over it once he learns his tactics aren't working. To be safe, you may want to put a harness and a collar on to check if this will work with your dog. Mine went into his escape mode when I first got it and slipped out of the harness, but the collar held firm. I am so grateful I found something that worked! I would not keep this on a dog I wasn't there with as it will not come loose and may strangle a dog in a real panic mode.",5
Not very sturdy even my dog only weighs 9 lbs. Don't recommended for larger dogs,3
I didn't get a chance to try it .there was a big hole in the box the seed was open. Very disappointed,1
One of my Maine Coon cats had constant eye infections when he was a kitten.  I stated giving them both the Vetri Lysine Plus chews and haven't had a problem since.  They are both 10 months old and in perfect health.,5
"I've bought 3 of these over the years and they work, but I don't understand why they have to be so expensive.  I also wish they came with a cover.",4
"Stronger flavor for my older Calico cat, she eats regular cat food and demands a treat now and then. She has been self medicting with coconut oil and epsom salts for months.",5
"If you have a pet with sensitive skin, this is the shampoo to use. Been using this shampoo for 13 years and can't say enough good things about it. Don't forget the conditioner, too.",5
"These are our labrador's new favorite balls. If you throw them in a lake/river they'll fill up with water and stop floating, but you just need to squeeze the water back out.",5
I love this spray! So easy to add to my dogs food. My vet recommended probiotics for my dogs and I tried another kind first but the sprayer in the bottle kept sticking and I hated it. Switched to this one and it's great! The product itself doesn't smell very good but my dogs seem to love it.,5
"This product works well...just as well as its much more expensive competitor. I have a beagle, the medium size takes care of her shedding issues. Money well spent.",5
"I bought this collar to replace my cat's previous snap-apart collar, which only lasted 30 days - losing both the collar and the ID tag.  This elastic collar is the best thing I've seen and won't hesitate to order another one.  However, I hope my cat doesn't lose this one anytime soon.",5
Nifty little item for our aquarium.  We would give it 5 stars but it arrived broken in shipping.  It was easy to glue back together in a couple of minutes.  It looks great in the fish tank.,4
"The toothbrushes are advertised as being for cats and dogs. Unless you have a cat with a very big mouth, even the smaller brush is too big to do the brushing job. Also my package arrived with the molded plastic cover no longer attached to the cardboard backing holding the tooth brushes.",2
Just after as year now being able to chew a hole in it...so was worth the price! I highly recommend this!,5
"I always buy these for my cat's Drinkwell water fountain and up until this last order they were fine.  This last order has been awful!  After only a week, the bowl is filled with charcoal bits.  Something is different.  At first I thought maybe I didn't soak it long enough or run enough water through it.  So, I gave them another chance but got the same results. I'm on the 3rd and last filter and I'm going to try to post a picture of the bowl.  3 times is enough. I'll either find another vendor for the filters, or just throw the entire system out. (Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.  I prefer to stay sane.)",1
works great !,5
"All are lost, likely eaten by the couch again. Kitties love them.",5
"My 10 month old cat was diagnosed with a heart condition and has to take Atenelol every day for the rest of his life... he loves this stuff! It turned ""pill time"" into ""treat time""... I just have to give my other cat a different treat when I give him his pill because she begs for this stuff, lol.",5
What I was looking for - Thanks!,5
"I've wanted to get myself a Marimo ""pet"" for years now after seeing them on Etsy and reading this description that made me fall in love with them ""Marimo is a fluffy living green ball that symbolizes love and everlasting relationship. They can grow so slowly for a very long period. The largest Marimo found in the wild is the size of a softball, estimated to be about 200 years old! They are the national treasure of Japan, and they believe that Marimos will bring you good luck if you take care and bond with them.
""
I think these things are super adorable. They are supposed to be very low maintenance and easy to care for. Change the water once a week, poke and roll them around every so often and they will slowly grow in size. Since I just got them, they're just in a glass of water but I'm excited to find the perfect glass vase/aquarium and create a customized little home for them and watch them grow!",5
"My dogs love these bones, my only problem is they are to expensive.
We will probably not order more until the price drops.",4
Cats all like this one.  Could use a little more liquid in it.,5
Dogs destroyed them in a few hours. One of my dogs actually ate half of one (and luckily threw it up a few days later),1
GREAT,5
My cats love this cat food.,5
Not as big of hit with my dogs as I would have suspected,4
"Pre-filter for Aqua Lifter. We have three to restart gravity fed siphons on a 70, 55 and a 30 cube. They perform reliably. The only difficulty is the hoses becoming clogged with detritus causing the pump to be unable to start the siphon. It is, after all, pulling air and water out of the drain for the tank. Everything that ends up in the filter sock passes through there.

The original pads now offered are supposed to be the same, but I decided to order 100 Gridlock to see how they would work with our 7 lb Yorkshire Terrier.  She is an indoor dog and never goes outside.  Our dog used them without noticing any difference.  The Gridlock pads seem to absorb slightly better, and they cost less per pad. I plan to reorder them when this batch begins to run low.",5
"My cats love the flavor of Ultramix, and eat it all up happily. I love that the ingredients are such high quality meats, veggies and fruits and grains. You can see the chunks of fruits and veggies in the food.",5
its pretty cool,5
My cat loves this! They drink so much more water with this. When I'm cleaning it one of the cats will sit and meow until I put it back. It is his favorite fountain. Has definitely kept him drinking enough,5
"I love this harness! It's nice given the price point. I initially bought medium because my dog is not large to me... it was too small. I blame myself because I did not measure, and I ordered a doggy jacket that was size large back in Dec. I ordered the L jacket based on kind reviewers who suggested sizing up. I want to offer that advice here.",5
"Good, sturdy crate.  Easy to set up and perfect for a growing puppy since it has a divider than can be moved to allow more space as the puppy grows.  Unfortunately, the large is now too small for my tall, 84 pound german shepherd.",4
"I bought this feeder directly from Wireless Whiskers but there is no where to post a review (of course) on their website  so I figured I'll voice my opinion on here about it!

The doors that close over top of the food dish take FOREVER to close after the selected cat is done eating! This leaves PLENTY of time for the next cat to eat food from the bowl WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DO NOT WANT!!!! I'm
Trying to feed my cats two specific seperate diets! And this is CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT as my one cat gets VERY VERY ILL from dry cat food!!!!

So this was a complete waste of time and money for me! Also the dry food is not properly sealed inside this feeder.... There are big spaces around the doors that cover the food which let excess air and bugs inside! The dry cat food gets stale quickly, ect! The smell of the dry cat food gets right through the spaces which are directly over top of the food, taunting other cats in the house to want to try to break into the food dish when it's closed, ect!

This product is a GREAT idea! Just a POOR design.... For my case anyway! Maybe if you just have ONE cat that your trying to feed and limit portions for then maybe this might work out ok possibly?

The cat that I do not want eating from this feeder is also very relentless at trying to get to this food while the selected cat is eating. So maybe if you your other cats that you don't want eating from this feeder are more timid, possibly this feeder may work for you?

All cats are different I guess so you just don't know until you try it....

As for me, I'm
Going to try MeowSpace next! Should've probably just tried that one first, but I was afraid my cat wouldn't push her head through the door flap to get into the food eating area. That is why I chose to try this feeder first, because this feeder does not require that process. Hopefully MeowSpace will work for my seperate cat feeding issues.... Because with that feeder, the entire cat and the food bowl are all enclosed in
One space..... I'll try to remember to update this review and let you all know how that one works out.",2
"I've personally taken fish oil daily for nearly 5 years on the recommendation from 2 physicians of mine. Neuro & knee surgeon. I've felt the benefits in my body.

I have 2 dogs, @ 10 - 11 y/o Pointer and a 14 y/o Jack Russell -  both of whom dealing with arthritis. I've used Pure Alaskan for a few months now, squirting it in their food dish. I've noticed them appearing less stiff; quicker to get to their ""feet"" at the slightest noise, jumping up onto the couch like they're not supposed to, and enjoying our long walks. Prior to using Pure Alaskan, these pups were slow in every sense, they stayed off the furniture, and definitely did not pull on their leashes to get me to hurry on our long walks.

They also LOVE the extra flavor and moisture on their food.

Win/win.",5
This cover is fantastic. Good quality. The seat anchors are great. Extremely attractive (which was really important as I have a brand new luxury car). Great at taking wear and tear and dirt. Washes easy.,5
"I have several of these for my multiple dog pack used as outdoor pens (I put several pens together to enlarge the area. The only negative I can come up with is, that the posts that you push into the ground to stablize the panels could be sturdier/thicker so they don't bend when pushing into the earth.",4
"Here is a comparison of 5 types of bedding options I've tried for my guinea pig.

1) EZWhelp puppy pads - Trying to save money with this reusable option, but unfortunately the guinea pig's fur started turning yellow because it needs more ""stuff"" to brush up against his legs and absorb pee off them. The pads were very wet to the touch and leaking a little because the guinea pig peed so much. I suppose I could have put in some towels on top to add absorption, but by this time I was tired of having to clean hay from my washer and pet hair from my clothes. The guinea pig also would step on his poop and get it on his paws, so I had to be vigilant about removing the poop. I give these a 2 for messiness and not keeping my pet clean.
2) Aspen shavings - Cheapest bedding. Nice woody smell. Not very good absorption - I can see wetness on the bottom of the cage when I scoop it. Depending on the brand, you may need to watch out for sharp pieces of wood. I give these a 3.5 for lack of absorption but good odor control and price.
3) CritterCare - The little pieces feels hard like cardboard. They also get compacted easily and poop stays on top, which means the guinea pig steps on poop and frequently gets it stuck in his paws. Odor control isn't the greatests. However, it absorbs pretty well. And wetness shows up clearly allowing me to spot clean easily. I give these a 3 for absorption but poop on paws.
4) Carefresh - It is similar to CritterCare in wetness absorption and odor control. However, pieces seem softer, and it doesn't get as compacted than CritterCare although occasionally, poop still gets stuck on his paws. I don't like the blue bedding because it dyes his privates blue (not healthy). The white makes it hard to see and remove wet spots. Odor control is disappointing. I give these a 3.5 for absorption and texture but lack of odor control.
5) Kaytee - This is basically shredded tissue paper. At first, I was so excited because it looked and felt like soft, fluffy snow. It did keep the guinea pig's fur and paws cleaner. Unfortunately, this stuff gets very messy on your carpet when it's on its way to or away from the cage. The pieces are so thin and small and tend to fall all over the place. It also tends to clump together, making it difficult to separate the soiled spots from clean bedding. The white color makes it hard to see wet spots. Moreover, odor control and absorption are both disappointing. I can see liquid on the bottom of the cage under wet bedding. I give it a 2 for messiness and lack of absorption.

After all these tries, I decided to go back to Aspen because my husband is always complaining about odor. I'm planning to mix it with some Carefresh, as some people do, to improve absorption.",3
On time and as advertised.  Perfect for what I need.,5
"My dogs get a combination of high-quality commercial food, and home-cooked.
And lamb seems to be what they like the most and tolerate the best. They rarely have loose stools or any other digestive issues. I absolutely love this food because, not only do all three love lamb as well, but because it contains all the ingredients in my home cooked food and more.
Part of the reason for those compact stools is the addition of bone and organs.

Sheep and cows are meant to eat grass, yet most cows are fed corn and pumped up with antibiotics and hormones. The lamb in this food is free-range and grass-fed, the way that they're supposed to be. That makes for a healthier animal, which translates as healthier food for my babies.",5
"My cat goes nuts for these. He gets very protective of this toy - sitting on it all 'back away its mine'. This is the second one I have bought, both great quality. The first one I have had a year and the cat still loves and it has held up very well no rips or tears minus the discoloration from the cat licking it. I bought the second one because sometimes the first one goes missing in the hamper or under the couch and its good to have a spare.",5
"Very efficient at heating my 40 gallon breeder tank, even with it in the corner, not centrally located. The heater barely kicks on and keeps the water at around 78-80 degrees Fahrenheit with ease even though I had to set the thermostat down to around 70 degrees. I have a stick on temperature reader on the opposite side of the tank from this and it constantly reads 78 degrees.",5
"My small dogs love these in fact I threw out all their older bigger stuffed toys and now only keep these
smmall ones in the toy box because thats all they will play with.  I even bought a bag of extra squeakers !!!",5
"Before purchasing this, I was using reptile bark for my leopard gecko. I was always worried about him ingesting it and it would get stuck to his feet and tracked everywhere. This carpet is so much better. It's easy to cut to the correct size, I don't have to worry about it harming my gecko, the gecko seems to like it, it's SO easy to clean, and it looks nice. I ended up having enough to make two pieces that fit his tank so when it needs to be cleaned I don't have to rush. I just take out the dirty one, replace it with the clean one, then can clean and air dry whenever I have time.",5
My little roomie loves her bed.,5
"I was having an issue with blackbirds attacking my bird feeder and emptying it within hours. I decided to try this bird feed and have not had any issues. Cardinals, blue jays, grosbeaks, and many other birds with manners enjoy my bird feeder now.",5
"This makes starting a Python sand siphon simplicity itself. I have a giant siphon for my larger tanks, so to start this I rest the siphon head against something hard (like rocks) because it otherwise jerks forward while I pump this squeeze-starter and loses the suction pressure. I have no desire to have a mouth full of aquarium water, so I use this at the end of my tube. The weight of this starter at the end of the tube keeps it firmly in the bucket, too.

The starter also comes apart easily to clear out if plant matter comes down the tube. The plant interferes with the one-way valve the next time you go to use it until you do so.",5
"I wanted to give this 5 stars but my dogs have one problem with this: they LOVE the base of the ear, and, well, that's it. Neither is interested in the flat part of the chew at all. I tried putting some peanut butter on it (they licked it off), soaking it in chicken broth (they didn't care; that was interesting), popping it in the microwave (no clue why I did that, but hey, why not; didn't work though). So I ended up just throwing them all out... except the pieces that are still floating around the house.

Usually they get bully sticks and like them but variety is the spice of life (right?! even for dogs!) plus these are a LOT cheaper (which happens to be the real reason I wanted these to work ;). I want to get them again because the pups really did like the rolled up crunchy base part, I just hate throwing half of it away afterwards.",4
Cats love it!,5
"my dogs loooove these treats. between table scraps and dog food, they don't need the extra calories so it's nice that these come in a lean version. my only complaint is that amazon needs to put these on their save and subscribe!",5
Higher than i was expecting. Good weight and color. Only thing is that the bristle pieces pull out very easily. Little hot glue fixes this but be careful if using it in a reptile tank.,4
"This toy surprised me, because my boxer likes it a lot. she has soooo, many toys scattered around, visitors sometimes look around to see if there are any kids;-). My dog has a cardboard box that I occasionally, gather up all her toys to put in the box, and she takes what she wants from the box. which is to say shwe empties the box, a Lot. She does like this toy, and the crackler is inside where she can`t make short work of it like other stuff, and it still crackles, which she likes. Having the dual purpose of it being a ball, is great.",5
Cats LOVE these treats. So do dogs! Good deal for the price.,5
My cat wouldn't even lick this off of her paw.,1
"Perfect...fit, cute and it works.",4
"Excellent quality, very sturdy and quiet easy to clean in my opinion. I use these when I do my water change.  I blow the detritus in my display and let it flow into my drain into these socks then take the socks out, let them dry and then turn them inside out and wash them out on the lawn with my garden hose.  Works great... wish they were cheaper so i could buy more.",5
Great flexibility and the company is very easy to work with.  I have a Boxer pup and the ability to control the levels is amazing.  I did have the collar quit working after a few months and the company sent me a new one without any questions.  Would definitely recommend for training a wild pup.  I was going to purchase one from a local retailer for well over 100.00 but the return/warranty process is nothing like it is through PetTech and with everything made oversees the odds are just as good the expensive one would have failed too.,5
Nice when not doing water changes as much and I want  my corals to get the proper minerals.,5
"Henry, our senior English Bulldog, has started marking in the house again.  No matter what we did he was lifting his lef everywhere.  I figured I'd try these pads again before he went back to the shame of a belly band, even though he knows how to take them off.

We put this in 2 of his favorite pee spots, and sure enough he did his business there and nowhere else!  The pads absorbed everything and I just swap them out after he's used them.  No urine residue was left behind either.

I know dogs just shouldn't pee in the house, but if you have a senior pet like I do it's hard to understand what the cause might be.  The vet said it wasn't a UTI and possibly just old age.  These atleast keep my clean up minimal and don't damage my floors.",5
Thank you,1
Very nice---great price---using as extra hook for dog's bike bag.,5
My cats like this. They sleep on it quite frequently. The only down side is that the cardboard is really frayed and so the appearance of the lounger is not as nice. I tried combing it but it still looks bad.,4
"These 2 foot leads are the best for training purposes, also if you have a dog that gets very excited when the door bell rings they are great to have by the door.  I have every color you offer. They are hard to find at any pet store, independent or big box.  The price is wonderful and if you had more colors I would buy more!  Good and sturdy, I have four large dogs and the leads handle them very well, nice when you don't want or need a 4 or 6 foot leash.",5
"Awesome...Beautiful. I LOVE these. My Taffee and Toffeee look so cute sporting their little bling tags. So pretty, professional lettering. Has held up well to my rambunctious golden retriever puppies who are 4 months old. Very nice company to do business with. Fast, courteous service. Will def buy from Providence Engraving again.",5
"My pooch loved it.  He saves it to munch on it everyday and it's been week, almost all gone.",5
"Although it was a little sketchy not having a tracking number to follow where the package was, it came within a week of me ordering it! I absolutely love it and the smaller size is perfect for my pug.",5
"Not a breakaway collar. At time of purchase, description said it was. Returned. Otherwise the quality seemed fine, compared to other brands.",2
It's a good purchase,3
"Simple and reliable. Works great, hope it lasts (one month working flawlessly). And all for two bucks!",5
"I pick up the bag, and my dogs appear out of nowhere!  Ha, Ha.",5
"I'm never without Natures Miracle and this laundry boost is fantastic, it gets the wet dog smell out of our dogs bedding and toys.  It also works wonders at getting that horrible cat urine smell out of fabric.  It just leaves a nice fresh scent that isn't too perfume or chemical like.  I've been a fan of Natures Miracle for a long time and this product just reminds me why!",5
"My dog likes this toy, but intermittently. Its a nice reprieve for me, but the pattern is very predictable and I feel that it is geared more towards cat behavior than dogs. It also requires 4 batteries, which are not included.",4
Love it! Great for large dogs as well!,5
"Excellent alternative to SD by Purina which is cost-prohibitive in a multi-cat household. Low in magnesium so good for kitties who get UTIs or gravel. Has kept my formerly diabetic cat healthy and symptom free from both diabetes and UTIs/gravel issues, which he was plagued with before this food. It's more expensive to feed your cats good food, but in the end, you save on vet bills and heartache, so it's definitely worth it.",5
Awesome mat. This is the best litter mat I have ever used. I have several litter boxes and will be replacing all the mats with this one. It traps litter very well and I just shake it to clean. Cats give paws up!!,5
My mice LOVE these exercise balls. Do make sure that the lid is secure when they are inside and that they are always being supervised while inside them.,4
I think it works so far after our first wash on our seriously crazy shedding bulldog,5
What can I say about refills.,5
"Note that this product is an extra leash for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Buddy-System-Hands-Free-Leash-Regular-Dog-System-Black-Regular/dp/B0002ZAZLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Buddy System - Hands Free Leash - Regular Dog System - Black Regular</a>&nbsp;which is sold separately. The below is a review of that product. As for this extension, I don't have a second dog but find it handy for leaving one leash on the belt and having another I can use in situation where I want to leash the dog by hand or to a pole for a few minutes. It is useful having two. Originally I bought this one by mistake trying to buy the full system that includes the belt, but I'm glad now to have two leashes for the system.

Full buddy system review:

I'm glad I bought this, if only for the ability to drop the leash from my hand sometime and still know the dog can only wander off but so far. That said, there is one issue with this leash that causes me to short it on perfection. The leash rotates to far around the belt (as in all the way around) that it makes it hard to train the dog to remain on one side of me (as recommended in dog obedience). Therefore I wind up holding the leash with my hand most of the time. And because the actual loop is on my waist, not in my hand, it isn't the easiest thing to do when the dog starts pulling.

If you have a well-behaved dog who always walks at your left, right by your side or slightly behind you, this will probably be a favorite new thingy for you. It is adjustable both in the girth of the belt and the length of the leash. It snaps on and off quickly. It has an extra loop for tucking away the loose leash when not in use. It even has an extra snap juncture so that you can leave the slightly more difficult to clasp latch on the dog (useful only if you have a larger dog that won't have the clasp dragging the ground when not attached to the leash). You couldn't really ask for more -- other than a shorter span that allows the leash to move around the belt so that it remains on only on one side and gives the dog a gentle reminder tug that he is going out of limit when he tries to go to the other side.",4
"I really like the look of this tank. The filter is quiet and not too strong for a Betta Fish. BUT, the switch on the hood does have issues. This is my second one of these tanks. With the first one, the switch quit working after a month. A new hood costs as much as a whole new tank so I ordered another set up. This light switch has lasted longer, but I don't know for how long. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I have to unplug it to turn it off. Sometimes I have to turn the power strip off and on to get the light to go on. Sometimes it will only turn on in green. Day to day I don't know what it is going to do. If and when the light switch gives out I'll get a different brand  tank for my fish. This would be a good one if the light switch worked better.",3
Cat loves em.  I use em to coax her onto the bed if I feel like a snuggle at bedtime.  If they're good for her teeth like it claims then I'm doubly happy with these treats.,5
my dog loves them,5
"My dog (a 15-year-old female Maltese) has inflammatory bowel disease. She is on a special no-grain, no-soy, no-corn diet (I HIGHLY recommend it, by the way, because it's done wonders for her delicate digestive system: Royal Canin Hypoallergenic Hydrolized Protein Small Breed dog food  --  available through your vet or you can buy it online; it's also available for larger breeds, as well). Because she can't eat ""traditional"" dog treats, I've spent countless hours searching for hypoallergenic treats for her. One of the best things I've found is the line of Bonus Bites Freeze Dried fish (the line includes salmon, cod, and lobster, all of which my dog loves). These treats are not only hypoallergenic, but also highly digestible, easily consumed, easy to feed, low-calorie, and extremely appealing to pets. My Suzie loves them!!!! When she sees me getting these treats from the cabinet, she gets REALLY excited! They're wonderful for pets with allergy issues, and they're also good for pets like mine with dental problems that necessitate soft treats. The Bravo Bonus Bites are small (half-inch or less cubes), so they can be used as training aids, as well as treats. Because they're made of fish, they're very high in Omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for pets' skin and coats. The treats are packaged in a small, lined, re-sealable bag, so the fish smell doesn't permeate your cabinets and there's no need to transfer them to a second container. You might, however, want to rinse your hands after feeding the treats to your pet. The fish line is complemented with lines of dry-roasted treats and meat treats, which provide variety in taste and texture for pets that find one flavor or processing style more appealing than another. The only downside is that the packaging is soft and provides minimal protection for the contained treats, which can be easily broken or crushed. I have not found this to be a significant problem, though I imagine it could be an issue if you are careless with the bag or if the treats are roughly handled in shipping. The package describes the treats as ""for dogs and cats,"" and from the reviews I've read, they are as desirable to cats as they are to my dog. Best of all, the Bravo Bonus Bites are all-natural with no additives, no preservatives, and no colorants, all which can cause digestive and medical problems. The bags are completely filled, so the treats last a long time and are a good value for the money. I highly recommend these treats and sincerely think you pets will enjoy them.",5
"does not fit on the cage very well and my birds would not even go near it, but seems well constructed.",3
Handy package. Ready when needed.,5
Price is right. If you  are a long term Aquarium keeper buying in bulk from amazon does save you money.,4
Our pigs love it! I will have to order more soon. I like that the price is much cheaper than Wal-Mart or Pets-Mart.,5
"I hate to put retail stores on their back, but this is a great buy and a great product- doggies love them, will buy again",5
"Product setup: There is very little assembly needed for this product. The only thing you have to do is attach the tub on top of the base, and then slide the feeding tray in place on the bottom. ***It is very important to insert the batteries before you fill the compartment with food, as the battery slot is on the bottom of the base.

Controls: You have the option of setting up at least three meal times, each with varying quantities of food to be dispensed. This is really helpful if you have pets that eat twice a day, or that eat too quickly and need their meals spaced out even by just an hour or two. The quantities are measured in cups, so for small sized-kibble, I find the smallest setting is sufficient.

Its very easy to set the time and feeding parameters, as there is a main button to toggle through all the options.

The feeder makes a low whirring sound when dispensing food (which your pets will learn to recognize and soon love), but its not so loud as to cause a disturbance. Most of the noise is just from the kibble hitting the bowl, but due to the design it mostly just slides in.

The plastic food contained may look a little flimsy, but its actually very well-constructed and over years of dropping it and having it bumped into things, it has held up very well. The top lid turns to lock into place, and while easy for humans to remove it for refiling purposes, none of my animals have been able to get it off themselves.

The only slight issue with this feeder is that between the feeding tray and the base, there is a small space through which you could reach in and manually turn the dispensing wheel to release food. This is probably not an issue for dogs, most of which would not be able to reach in, but I have one cat who figured out she can feed herself on demand by shoving her paw up and turning the dispenser. To solve this problem, I just taped a piece of cardstock near the hole, so food could come out but her paw could not go in. Easy fix!",5
"Cats love it !  Our house cat and barn cat practically want nothing else to eat and I am ready  to order more through Amazon.com.
Thank you very much...",5
This stuff is nothing short of phenomenal. My Lab suffers from seasonal skin allergies and this product is a lifesaver for him offering immediate relief from itching and aiding in keeping the bacteria and microbes at bay.,5
"Bought this to help my dog get to the cab-over bed in the class C motorhome.  It is a steep climb, but works.  Wish you made longer ones.",5
"Nice elevated feeding tray.  It's not very sturdy, but I once assembled I can slide it to the side to clean without it coming apart.  My dogs are medium size and comfortably eat from the large tray.  The bowls aren't high quality and quickly began to rust when kept full of water.  We rarely use the water bowl now for that reason.  I would definitely purchase again if I convince my other half to let me have another furry friend, or if they wore out.  However, I have had these for several months, and there isn't any signs of wear on them.  If they get a bit dirty from messy eaters, they are easily wiped off.",4
Great cat tree. It is very stable and works well for big cats!,5
"My mixed breed dog would tear up anything and everything he could get his teeth on until he started wearing this anti-anxiety coat.  Before when we would come home the first thing we do is damage control.  Now we can't believe it when nothing is torn up!  If we leave the house and forget to put this on he will find something to destroy.  We were amazed at how well it works on him.  We also put it on him when our granddaughter is coming over to keep him from jumping on her.  Works every time!  I have it on my list to purchase another for a spare.

Edit:  I changed my review from 5 to 4 stars.  I'm still happy with how it is working BUT since my last review my dog managed to chew it up while he was wearing it!  After the first chewing he didn't ruin it so we should have been able to use it a while longer, however he managed to chew it again to a point it was off when we got home and it is no longer usable.  He was very proud of himself and I'm certain he was watching Houdini videos while we were gone.  I already ordered another one and may have to figure out how to keep him from chewing it up.  I think I see a collar of shame in his future.",4
This light gets 3 stars for overall functionality because of the lack of features/ options you have available . It is a beautifully designed compact powerful slim light that compliments the aquarium cosmetically but just falls short in the color spectrum category and leaves you wanting more.,3
My dog loved these.,5
My dog loves these!,5
"One dogs likes them and the  other dog  will have to get another  as he turns up his nose to,  Dakota has skin allergies so am careful what I buy him and with the omegas in this and he liking it hope it will help,.",5
"Love the toy, looks like it would be fun for her to play with. She loves squeaker toys.
Unfortunately, squeakers are too small and not enough of them. I was expected squeakers on hands and feet, naturally a, and on the tummy and head. Nothing there.  I tried playing with it when it arrived couldn't even find the tiny squeakers. Very Dissappointed. She played with it for about one minute and was done. Returning!!!",1
"The pump is essentially silent on low.  I hung the pump on the wall and turned it on.  I asked my husband if he could hear the pump and he was shocked, ""What pump? Where is it??""  On high it isn't even as loud as the refrigerator.  Not a large pump... wouldn't use in a tank larger than 40 gallons.  Per other reviews, I used both air exports with a bubble wand on each side.  I'm sure that helps attribute to the quietness. Definitely will order again if I need another pump.",5
Cute towel. Super soft and I'm sure my dog will  it! I haven't used yet. Now he has his own towel just for jim. Great quality...,5
"sorry for 1 star but it didn't work for my kitties,
BTW they return my money back as promised.",1
My Daughter's Boxer puppy LOVES these balls especially when we play fetch.,5
Great product - Does exactly what I needed.,5
amazing deal for this many bags!  not much more to say. if you walk your dog and have to clean up after him...this is the deal for you.,5
"I wish I could give it zero stars. I have seven week old kittens They can't play that rough and this broke in less than 15 min.. and no not the feather but the cord snapped. If these kittens were 9 m, I could try to say maybe they were to rough but these kittens are still under 2 pounds. What wand cat toy can't stand up for more than 15 min from a 1 pound 12 oz kitten? It really was a shame because this really caught their attention. They LOVED it while it lasted.  I tried to tie the ends and make it work again and then the whole cord unraveled .. in the trash. From opening the package putting it together and then it hitting the trash can was less than two hours. I hope mine was a dud as I said kittens were riveted by it. Debating buying again to see if I got one that was defective. If I buy, I will update my post/review. I have included a picture of where the cord broke and picture of my foster kittens so you can see how small they are and why it could not have been them. Yes, there are four but too small to do real damage in 15 min.",1
I love this color on my boy maltese. It stands out and I love the color!! Very giving. He's 7lbs and fits a small.,5
"Good clipper and price good if nail trimmer included, as stated, but once on PetCo web page, it's just the clipper.",3
We had a large one but it made a lot of noise so I thought the smaller one won't be as noisy. NOPE! Will probably end up getting the larger one!,5
"I love these over the plastic combs that come with the clippers.  These do not bend easily and protect the scalp from the heat of the clipper blades.  They are also magnetic and help secure the comb to the clippers.  Take a couple of tries to get used to how it goes on and off, but after that you feel confident that they are staying in place.",5
"Absolutely wonderful pancho!
Well Made!!
We are so happy as is our little man!
Recommend to all and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE TOO!!",5
I bought two of these 1S (small) trays & just ordered the large one! I don't have to worry about messy floors anymore! I am using these trays to put my kitties' food & water dishes on them and protect the floors from the moisture of water spills and food. Excellent product and the delivery was extra fast! Very pleased with this purchase!,5
Cat rating,4
When buying this product I was a little hesitant due to because it was online but I did order it and my rabbit loves it and it has lasted us for like two months which is great safes us alot of money I would recommend it has all kinds of goodies in it thT your rabbit  will love. I would by this again!,5
Not impressed so far. Hope to send it back!,1
"I was sent a product called Natures Miracle Advanced Just For Cats Stain & Odor Remover , Not the Urine Off Odor and Stain Remover for Cats I Ordered!
 I have not opened the Natures Miracle container.",1
Good price for some reason most of these kind of mats are way overpriced I think.  Fits two large dog bowls (the large size) good quality and serves its purpose of catching water and keeping bowls in place.,5
Would purchase again.,5
"I am always suspect over random bad reviews when the majority are glowing. Unfortunately, my experience is with the guy who lost all fish to a cloudy tank. After filling a 12 gallon tank with this and filtered water, it was very cloudy and has not cleared with tons of lives plants and 2 filters running for 3 weeks. I have lost about 15 shrimp and 2 fish to the mysterious cloud. The substrate is very nice, however it seems deadly. Should have rinsed it thoroughly in hindsight. Note, the instructions explicitly tell you that rinsing is not required. If you read in the comments you will learn that shrimp do not fare well with this substrate. They will molt rapidly and soon die after molting. The ph is too high and something about lack of calcium in the water to reform their skeleton.",2
Our cats love these. Great price.,5
Very safe crinkle toy for our dog.,5
They Go Crazy Over These Treats,4
"well,  you are never going to run out of waste bags once you've bought these!  They are large enough for our needs (our puppy is 5 months and 9 pounds)  and tie off easily (though no handles).  It holds the odor in well and isn't too thin, tears off easily and hasn't torn incorrectly.  Would buy again (in a few years time!)",5
Dog likes it but not as much as the power chew ring.,4
Doesn't phase my dog one bit,3
excellent price,5
My small puppy likes this formula.,5
"OMG!  Too cute, perfect fit. Growls when I take it off!",5
My dogs love this toy..,5
made my cat throw up.,1
These are the best!  Thick bags that are scented.  Help take care of the dirty business!,5
"I wanted to give this a try for my feral cat colony.  My feral colony really like IAMS; however this, is just too expensive.",4
works,4
Started off a cute idea. I put this in my pup's Easter basket and he didn't pay too much attention to it at first. Until he ripped the tag off and it tore the fur open. He got the inside out and chewed it into hundreds off pieces then walked around with the squeaker proudly. If your dog likes to rip off tags I wouldn't recommend this.,3
"If your pet gets fleas, then your carpet and furniture will also! The Hartz Ultraguard is great for spraying furniture and carpets to rid yourself of them. I recomment spraying at night, before going to bed, to allow spray to soak and dry overnight rather than aitting on a freshly sprayed cushion",5
"These are large sheets, well with the money!",5
I prefer this to the clear line as it is more flexible for hiding it in the tank.,5
"Love it! Got results back for my puppy within 2 weeks of sending it out. Report told me a lot about one side (which was purebred until my pup's mom) and less about the father's side (half mini poodle for several generations and a mix on the other side). Considering getting a second test for the father to see if we can unlock his parentage (it only reports up to 3 generations, so if the 4th generation is mixed it will only tell you which breeding group [sporting, terrier, etc] they belong to.)
The vet was very happy I had this test done :)",5
Smells great and keeps my puppy's coat extremely soft until she decides to go roll around in the mud again.,5
BIEN,5
"fine, cat likes it",5
Love it!!,5
It clumps,5
"Okay quality. A bit noisy (the self heating material crunches when your dog walks around on this). The outer fabric is very weak so a dog will be able to chew through this no problem. Would only recommend for dogs who don't chew their beds but for the low price, they are easily replaceable.",3
Not meant for anything serious unfortunately. It's a cute design and would be great if it were thicker and could actually absorb a little blood. :(,3
"actually, my fish don't like it...neither of my bettas like it",2
"This toy is amazing.  You can't tell from looking at the picture alone, but it moves exactly like a bird when you swing it around.  The cat goes absolutely bonkers for it, I have never seen her so excited. It is not very expensive either, it is definitely worth purchasing.",5
WORKED WONDERS AND REALLY GAVE MY DOG RELIEF WITHIN 24 HOURS,5
"This cat carrier is the perfect size for traveling with my smallest pet, my cat Lisa. It unzips from the top so I can place her in that way with no hassle or fuss. When I first received this carrier, I was able to unzip it fully so she could go inside and smell and lay to get used to it and that helped a lot. I would definitely recommended to my family and friends!",5
My dog loved this product. And I would buy it again,5
My dog loves these that's why I keep buying them over and over again. The price is fair and the shipment is fast. Thank you ..... great product,5
These are NO easy SOFT,1
"Well, I saw my birds dive into this as soon as I installed it. So I think it's safe to say, they like it!",5
i ordered this plant on monday and recieved it wednesday.the plant was in great shape and very big and green.looks very good in tank.i will buy from them again.i rated them a 5 because fast and the plant was great shape.,5
I ordered the XL and had to return it for an XXL.  It never fit my 1.5 year old ridgeback correctly. It constantly turns on her. I gave it a one star because it's made poorly/cheaply. The trim started to come off after 6 uses in more than one place. If your dog sheds like mine the hair gets all over the harness and it's a bitch to get it all off and it looks dirty. I don't even use this anymore and wasted my money.,1
"My two Mini Schnauzer's are very treat picky. They like all of the Newman's Own treats, but these are their favorites. I wish they were a little smaller so I could give them multiple times a day or use them for training. They get one after breakfast and remind me if I forget.",4
Very Soft Treats.,5
My dog loves these. Great for training.,5
"Cats like this. They use it flat on the floor  instead of tilted up. And it always ends up on.
You will still  need more scratch products.",5
"This cat door is perfect for heavier cats or even small dogs. On the box it states ""good for cats up to 25 lbs.""  My 32 lb male fits nicely. I love the way the door closes and the material it is made of, tough yet lightweight for my smaller female kitty.  It cleans nicely also.  The price is low compared to others on the market.",5
"I know what you're thinking, is this collar worth the extra money? Well, the sum of its parts add up to a decent value, aimed mainly at people whose cats go outdoors and do not have nice collars yet.

-The collar itself is nicely reflective when using a flashlight in the dark. The ""break away"" part is an elastic band that's tied together inside one of the halves of the collar. The holes that the metal buckles into are a bit small and might stretch/fray over time - my cat's prior collar had a metal ring around each hole to protect it from being pulled too much. I agree that the overall construction of the collar is a little more rigid than standard leather collars, but it's not like it digs into the neck. The problem I have is that it always slides around so that the tag ends up on the bottom of her neck and the bell at the top. Not good for her feeding time, where the tag would dip into/interfere with her wet food.

-The bell is just a standard bell, silver and very noisy. Maybe too noisy for an indoor cat, as it jingles with every move she makes...but good for outdoor excursions, especially after dusk.

-You have to shine a light on the tag before it glows in the dark. 5 seconds against a CFL bulb will make it shine for half an hour. This was what sold me on the collar, as I could write her name and phone number on the back. Single tags cost way too much, and here it's almost a bonus with the collar.

Personally, I prefer her regular collar during the day. I only put the reflective one on if I think she's going to get out while I do stuff outside in the evening.",3
"We have four dogs that loved to bark and lunge at people as they walked in front of our gate.  This works wonders for distracting them and correcting their behavior.  The noise is enough to snap them out of it, so that they can focus on your command instead of being so caught up in the moment.  I recommend this product, but also recommend that you use it as directed.  You should focus on one behavior at a time to get the best results.",5
Our not quite year old black Labrador loves this thing and he hasn't destroyed it yet and it's been over a week. He has chewed through everything with the exception of this chewy and the Hartz bone - those are indestructible as well. Our dogs have never been crazy about Kong toys unless there is something yummy in it or it isn't been thrown for them to retrieve. I am guessing its that odd rubber texture they don't care for.,5
"I just drop my 30-lb bag of dog food in this, cut open the top of the bag and I'm done.  Wonderful product",5
"Got this for my sons little kitten who has stomach issues, works great!!",5
Pigs loves this. Adult pig hiddie,5
I thought it was going to be a little bigger  but the pups liked it a lot. I think it'd work well for babies too.,4
works very effectively....,5
"JUST BEAUTIFUL...But beware. I ordered 2 of these vases for my 75 peacock cichlid tank, just received them today. I normally do not review a product the same day, if ever I must confess, but for fish lovers out there, I felt compelled. The holes in these vases are big enough for my full grown peacock cichlids, and that is hard to find. But, when I unpacked them, I felt the inside of the top and the two openings and to my dismay there were very sharp edges. I sanded them down, took some time, and now they're in the tank. The fish are swimming in and out and loving them, but I am so glad I checked, cause a startled cichlid EXITING the vase could have sustained an injury. The inside is mauve and beautiful.",4
"Perfect! I specifically wanted a not-crinkly one because I like to SLEEP at night and didn't want to listen to the kittens running crazy. They love it though, and so far it's survived being tripped over, fallen on, clawed, chewed, and crumpled. They've knocked things over on top of it and carried wrestling fights over it and it pops right back, without being deafening.",5
Nice scent and cat doesnt hate it. Although it is difficult to leave it on his fur for 5 minutes..,5
Our dog loves these.,5
did what it was supposed to...wish the light on the heater was a little larger so I could see if it was on and working or not.  otherwise it's great.,4
If you have a fish tank you should have one,5
Great for my picky little turtle that finally ate these as a supplement to his regular diet.  Highly recommended for fussy turtles.,5
"I bought my chinchilla a new cage and his old litter box no longer fit. This one is perfect and stays in place in the corner. I don't use the plastic part on top, just the base filled with Carefresh.

I found that my chinchilla was peeing in the opposite corner, so I bought another one of these and filled it with hay. Now he uses it to eat out of and leaves the corner alone.",5
"Pups each get 3 after we have our meals.....they earn them by sitting in the ""sit-stay"" puppy bed while we eat.  Rascal moans but remains in the sit-stay until called. Scam usually just waits quietly.  They love these treats.",5
My cats could take or leave this brand so I had to put it outside for the feral cats,4
"I think it's a great produce and kitties love the flavor packet.  However, I wish that it contained the other strains of probiotics too.",4
"This is supposed to be a monthly treatment for dogs against fleas and ticks. I have four dogs and was hoping to find a less expensive way to rid my fur babies of those nasty pests without the expensive price for the more popular brands. This product is not the one. It goes on very oily and does not absorb readily like most flea and tick products. I put it on my dogs yesterday and the treatment areas are just as wet and messy today. But the most disappointing thing is that two of the four dogs still had fleas this morning.  I was really hoping for an effective way to keep my pets free and clear from fleas without have to spend an enormous amount of money, but I will have to pass on this particular product.",2
"I purchased the diamond plate at a local dog store. It lasted 10 minutes with my 6month beagle/ lab puppy who has all his adult teeth. He is a strong chewer, but this is the fastest he has chewed up a chew toy. The planet dog bone lasted longer with him.",1
"I bought this cage because I was planning on getting a second chinchilla so mine wasn't alone, which unfortunately didn't happen, but my little boy has no issue jumping around in it and the bar spacing is plenty small enough that I don't have to worry about him squeezing through.  It's also a lot roomier than I was thinking it would be when I purchased it.

I got this promptly which is always a plus and the box it came in was sturdy and it was packed nice and tight.  However setting it up was a pain in the rear, I suggest getting a second person to help you set it up if you can.  There were also no directions for it but luckily it wasn't too hard to figure out.

Putting the wheels on was a lot harder than it should have been because I was stupid and forgot them until after I had pulled it all apart, but that's my fault. The wheels also like to collapse inward but this could be due to my stupidity and they might work better if I had done them first.

The cage wasn't nearly as sturdy as I was hoping and most of the reviews were rather misleading.  However with some heavy duty wire and pliers to secure the corner bars together it is now an extremely sturdy cage (at least sturdy enough for a little chinchilla, I don't know about a cat though).

Overall I'm pleased with it for the price but it could have been better quality.",3
My cats love these and play with them endlessly.  They keep getting lost under things though.,5
I love this rake for getting undercoat out Golden Retrievers and other long coated breeds. Also great for long hair cats. Saves a lot of grooming time. Ihave been a professional,5
"I bought this based on the great reviews, but none of my 4 cats went for it.  They didn't respond to the catnip on it either.  I wouldn't recommend it unless your cat responds to catnip.  My kitties prefer toys with valerian root scent.",1
Works and looks great.. Turtle loves it.,5
The rubber ring constantly comes off.  It's a nuisance to put back on and it slides around like crazy without the ring.  Too much trouble!,2
Great quality product.  I see some fraying of the threads as it softens up but the dog is high speed all the time so the collar is getting a workout.,4
"My daughter has a whole city of cages connected by these tubes.  She gives the tubes five stars, but she wanted me to warn customers that the tunnels should be used only for dwarf hamsters because Syrian hamsters get stuck when they fill up their cheeks.  I have no idea if that's true.  She doesn't have a Syrian hamster, but she read about it somewhere.  Anyway, two packs were all she needed to connect three&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CritterTrail-Quick-Clean-Habitats/dp/B00XJKIBCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CritterTrail Quick Clean Habitats</a>&nbsp;and a travel carrier.",5
Obviously for some rodents not great . We had one that came with a Pygmy hedgehog & it loved it and we used it for transport worked well,4
"I used this litter for about a year and haven't tried the new package formula yet, but after reading reviews it sounds like the new formula isn't as good as the old formula.

I recently tried the arm and hammer litter and the odor control is exponentially better.  The clumping is  noticably better too.  The arm and hammer litter uses smaller granuals which makes it messier, but I NEVER smell amonia or poop.  I doubt I will come back to precious cat litter, but when I was getting it for about 12 bucks primed, it was a good deal.",3
"Good size, stable and the birds like/use it. Hard to find",5
Safe for bunny and a great price,5
If I could leave no stars I would.  Besides smelling awful it had no effect on my cat.,1
"It does not scratch the tank, even acrylic ones. the scrubber, for the most part cleans the acrylic sides of the aquarium, but cannot get into smaller spaces.",3
Cough gone - a complete lifesaver for my Frenchie - makes me feel & him so much better :-),3
"My senior dog has never liked taking pills.  I don't like opening his mouth and putting the pills down the back of his throat.  These pill pockets are great!  I just put the pills in and give it to him like a treat. The medicine stays in the pocket nicely and I don't have to worry about him finding the pills and spitting them out like he did with cheese, hot dog or other food items.",5
"Got this to put the cat food up and away from the dog. Works exactly as needed, and looks good.

Was not very DIY friendly for me. The precut holes for attachments were not executed properly, with some not even there. Had to get out the drill and boyfriend to put it together.",4
We have lots of cat toys and two on this order round and double round ball toys.  He really seems to enjoy the bump in the track nice toy for the money.,5
cats love these treats,4
"I should have remembered ""you get what you pay for""  This may have been an adequate lead for toy breed puppy, it did not hold up after a single use with medium/large breed puppy - 8 wk old German Shepherd, stitching at buckle came loose and the buckle almost came off.  Thankfully I was in a fenced yard, not on the sidewalk.",1
"My dog loves these! If I give him one, he'll carry it around with him everywhere so he doesn't have to leave it behind just to go outside or to another room.  He has to really work at it to wear soften these and eat pieces, so it keeps him occupied for a long time.",5
"works beautifully,  easy to set up, easy to flip out of the way as needed.",5
This leash is great quality.  I also got a color that seems to match.  I have had the leash for about 6 months and it is wearing in beautifully and I don't see any signs of it breaking down only getting softer and more beautiful.,5
Love this brand of raw hides,5
such good value our puppy enjoys playing with all these toys,5
"As already described by other 1-star reviews, these rawhides are terrible.
Once available at Sam's for half the cost, these were rolled hides.

Not any more -- these are now stuffed with some weird and strange filling that immediately falls apart within minutes.
Once this happens, my Malamutes (who love rawhides) walk away, leaving a chunky dried mess that takes a garage vac to clean up.",1
I love this mat and save me lot of money for I can wash it over and over again but i wish there is a white color for I put white towel on top of it for my puppy is not familiar with brown mat even I used the training spray. He was trained using the white disposable mat.,5
The chrome color is a nice shade and not as stark as the white. Blends in with our contemporary decor.,5
"Finally, a natural fly spray that actually works and actually lasts.  It also smells wonderful.",5
works real good,5
"My dog hates regular milkbones but absolutely loves these. Heck, even my cat loves them! Will buy again!",5
"Our Pomeranian had a chronic skin condition and although the vet had given us meds, they just didn't work. His belly had actually gotten areas of black pigment that he seemed to dig at all the time. This cleared it up and he is out of his misery!!! Amazing stuff!!!",5
My dog didn't care for the flavor of these,3
"It works alright but a bit of info for picking out a heater that I did not know. When choosing the right wattage you need to consider how many degrees you need the water to be higher then the room temperature and that nano aquariums can be affected by room temperature change much more then say 20 gallons or higher. For me, I need it to be around 7 degrees higher at night and this heater is not enough for my 5 gallon aquarium. It is working great during the day keeping my tank at 78 degrees but at night when my room gets colder it can't keep up and my water drops to around 74 to 76 depending on how cold the night is. Not too bad now but I will need to replace this heater for a stronger one before winter hits or I risk my fish becoming stressed and getting sick. So I decided to use the heater in my 3 gallon tank to see how it would fair, again it has the same issues works in the day at night the water temperature drops 2 to 4 degrees. Another thing the temperature dial accuracy is +/- 1 degree and you can't pick in between temperatures for example I wanted to heat my water to 80 degrees but the dial has 79 (which would be fine but my unit was -1 degree so it was actually 78) and the next number was 82 (actually 81) even if I put the dial in between the 2 numbers it would not give me 80, only one or the other.",3
My pet rat uses this as his bed. He looks so cute in there with his little head staring out at me. He can also go in further and cuddle up to go to sleep. It washes up nice and goes right back in the cage. It has really held up quite well.,5
"My dogs are always crazy happy when puppy food gets mixed into their kibble.  They like the higher fat content and higher flavor content.  I can tell from the way the tails wag the dogs.  They liked this.  Two of my dogs are puppies but they always end up eating the same thing.

I also found that it smelled good.  I like dog food to smell like actual food, not kibble.",5
"Our two toy poodles love this and the chicken, Have yet to try the lamb.  This is an excellent food but would be very expensive for larger dogs that eat a lot.  Our two little ones go crazy when they see me take it out.  For a larger dog, it would be good crumbled on top of other kibble. I think they love it because it is just good stuff.
Easy to take when traveling, just add water.  We also add a little Orijen kibble. So happy we found this food.
Just suggested this to a neighbor for her small pup, a hugh hit.",5
great,5
Miss Bailey started to rip the tennis ball material off the outside...but I think the tennis balls have more of a chance surviving because they roll!! She chases them more than chews on them. I don't let her take them outside either because I don't want the tennis balls picking up stickers and her getting stickers in her throat.,4
"Wow do my Great Danes LOVE this toy! What an awesome idea! I just love Kyjen simply for making this toy. My dogs love to play tug of war with the entire thing, to shake the log and send the squirrels flying, to carry the squirrels around in their mouths, and to try and pry their noses into the log's openings to get the squirrels out that are stuffed inside. It is way too cute. They absolutely freak out when I bring this toy out for them to play with. There should be more toys like this one. This is a must buy! Worth the money!",5
"Java fern plant is large And healthy (4-5""). Absolutely LOVE it! Strong root system anchored to. Coconut shell which easily stayed in fluorite soil. Highly recommend to new planted aquarium owners!",5
"Perfect bowl, easy to clean, doesn't move on the floor while they eat. Perfect and great price.",5
Needed an automatic cat box.  Main reason I chose this one is because it didn't require special cat litter or special bags for the receptacle.  Love it!  Works great and I can just use my plastic grocery bags.,5
Our dogs love to play tug o war with each other with this rope.  Plenty long!,5
"I have been brushing my poof ball puss for days anticipating this being delivered and it is true, I am still getting wads outa her.  Unbelievable and she seems to like the gentle throbbing of the unit.  That it only costs 7 bucks is amazing.
It is heavy in the hand meaning substantial and not cheap weak plastic.
A must have for ANY pet owner",5
Cats love it. Mimics a bird flying. Great fun and exercise for them. I like the long wand. It is true that I have to hide this toy from my one cat. She is always wanting to play with it. Always... I have to tell her no all the time. She gets really excited when I take it out. Her eyes light up and her tail starts to wag like crazy.,5
I like this product.  My rabbit has a runny nose and is old so this helps him get extra food when he can't smell his hay.  Thank you!,4
"The only product I will allow in the house for cat litter.  There is no odor from product, no adverse allergic reactions to litter by cats or my self, easy to care for and cleanup, and saves money in long run over any other product I have tried.  It is save for pets, people and enviornment. Win, win, win!",5
"This wasn't a huge hit with our puppy but only because he got too many toys at once.  This is a great toy when he plays with it because it's perfect for teething puppy.  This rates on my puppy package list of must buys, its the right size and great quality and doesn't easily fall apart!!",5
Our dog has absolutely no interest in this.  It's way too heavy and the openings are just too big.  Try a regular Kong or another football type ...  this one just doesn't work.  (our pup is 70lbs and he can destroy a toy in no time),1
"My cats really love this food.  The picky boy who doesn't care much for wet food ate almost all of his portions when I fed him this.  The girl cat usually likes wet food more than dry food devoured this stuff in a couple of minutes, way faster than she eats the Friskies cans.",5
breaks in a day. worthless I had 3 of these all failed the same way.,1
great,5
"This was a repeat order for this product from this vendor.  Half the price of purchasing from my vet ( I do not mind supporting a local small business, but 100% mark-up?).  The product was delivered before the promised date and my dog continues to act like a puppy even though she is over 11.5 years old.",5
Great Product !! Easy to use very affective,5
"I have been buying Midwest crates for years.  for the most part I am very happy with them.  Every now and then I get one with rough edges, but not often.  I will continue to buy the icrate for my rescue dogs.",4
"Way too small and flimsy for a leash. I'm afraid if my dog pulls at all it will snap in half. I bought 2, one for each dog and wish I didn't.",1
Not the highest quality cat toy but he still loves batting them around the house. I gave him all at once and they are now stashed all over my house in every room,4
the dogs just them!,5
"This was a bag of dried up sticks, not the nice soft grass shown in the picture at all.  My guinea pigs scatter most of it around looking for a few pieces that they can eat.  Since hay is such an important part of a cavy's diet, I had to throw it away and buy a bag of hay at the pet store.",1
My cats love these. Gives them exercise. I've bought them more costly toys that they had no interest in but they like to play with these!,5
excelente,5
My cats are very long so I ended up securing it to an end table so they could really stretch out and claw it.  they have a great time but have taken the mouse off several times - not a problem they have plenty of toys so I can switch them out.,4
"Ricci loves his Nutri-berries. I use them more for a treat than for his regular diet, but he knows when I pull the lid off.",5
Strong and pretty leash,5
Didn't check the size when I bought it. Came in the mail and looked like a big screwdriver lol. Does its job though.,4
"To small for track, was lost within first couple hours if first day day",1
"My little Shih Tsu loves these chews.  They last her about 30-45 minutes, are healthy and non-staining.  The price is great, less than half the cost at local stores.  Shipping is always excellent.",5
"This fish tank is much better than any starter tanks you will find in the pet store - and the price can't be beat.

PROS:
* large enough for a betta to swim around and have some space
* great design, perfect for offices, kid's rooms, or anywhere else you'd like to put it
* cordless!!!! My tank is for my office, which has VERY limited outlet space
* the light is bright and makes the tank look beautiful
* the light is exterior to the tank, which means that little splashes of water will not get inside the light to damage it (see photos). I've had many fish tanks before, and a damaged light from prolonged water exposure is the worst
* the light runs on batteries, and there is also a space for you to plug it in. I've read in other reviews that the plug can charge the batteries, but I haven't tested that theory yet. My Kindle charger fits, so you shouldn't have to buy a whole new cord just to charge the light. You probably already have something around the house that matches.
* easy to clean
* the light can be used on the top of the tank or on the bottom (I put mine on the top, but I imagine it would look beautiful on the bottom if I had jewel rocks)

CONS:
* there are plastic bumps at the bottom of the tank, to hold the light in place if you want to put the light on the bottom. These bumps make it impossible to place artificial plants with large bases in the tank. Both of my plants are placed near the front of the tank to avoid the bumps, and I'd rather have the plants near the back. You can see the bumps in the photos (the bumps are exactly the same on the bottom of the tank as they are on the top of the tank).

HOWEVER - the pros for this tank greatly outweigh the cons. I loved this tank so much, I ordered a second tank for my co-worker. She currently has a betta in a much smaller tank, and I know he'd be happier in this one.",5
"I have searched the Internet for treats for my white german shepherd, She has major allergies and can only eat certain treats as well as food. Bought these on a whim at the pet store and she LOVES them!! Buying on line allows me to buy a BIGGER bag for all they sold at the pet store were smaller bags fo more money. Shipment arrived on time and in good condition!! PureBites are the ONLY treats for my Doggie!!!",5
Immediately stopped my dog from pulling. Makes walking so much easier!,5
"Have reordered 3,times
Like the fragrance effectiveness and not as bad as some chemicals for
Well being of animal s
Thank you!",5
"All of the Play-N-Squeak toys are great!!  I have the mouse, raccoon and skunk.  My 6 month old Tuxedo Cat seems to enjoy the raccoon and skunk better than the mouse, as these are smaller and furrier than the mouse.  He loves to fetch these toys when I throw them, carries them from room to room, and will occasionally play independently with them.  Five Stars!!",5
Bought this harness for a pup who is difficult to walk because of anxiety. She has managed to get out of other harnesses but this has a martingale feature-reason for purchase and so far no escape! It is handy that the harness is color coded to assist with placement. It is easy to adjust and has a soft no irritation fabric for the chest and front legs. The leash is nifty as it attaches to two separate areas but is a little short for us. Would be great length for training though and can be used as a single. Am happy with this product.,5
"Trusted company! Nothing from China!

These are TINY treats and my 40lb dogs demand at least 4 of them or they do not consider them an 'official' snack.",4
"They're kind of impartial to these, not their favorite.",3
"I needed a harness for my toy poodle who had out grown his strappy harness. This one fits  a vest so I would imagine that it's more comfortable than the strappy one. It's also padded for extra comfort, its mesh-type material allows better ventilation which I'm sure is very much appreciated in our hot climate. It's made of a mesh like material which isn't see through. Very happy customer and dog.",4
"This is a terrific little carrier for a small dog or larger cat (or two smaller cats if they are friendly!)  It comes disassembled and is very easy to put together; if you've put together one of these crates, you can put together any of them.  The only thing I would change about it is that it includes a hex key to use to screw some nuts onto hex-head bolts.  It's easy enough to do, but it means you need to keep that tool handy to take it apart (sometimes we do that at the Vet with cats that don't want to come out the door) or to tighten the nuts, which you really should do before you use the carrier each time.  Working at a Vet's office, there are few things as distressing and sad as the client who comes in holding half a carrier, asking us to please help her find her pet because the carrier came apart on the way in or out.  I do like wingnuts better than the hex-keyed option provided here, as they are easily finger-tightened, and it might be worth it to see if the provided nuts can be replaced with those.

Accessories include the standard little plastic water or food cup that clips on the side or door of the crate; if actually using this during transport, you'll probably want to zip-tie it into place.  There are also the usual ""live animal"" stickers that airlines require, and, while I can't speak for the airlines, I can't see any reason this crate wouldn't comply with the requirements of the few who still carry pets as checked baggage.

One thing I especially like is that there are ventilation holes along the bottom of the crate as well as the top.  Great idea!

The plastic crate is sturdy but light-weight and can easily be cleaned in a large sink or bathtub.",4
I don't know about helping with gut flora but sprinkle this kitty MSG on food that the princess is not a fan of and she'll be much more apt to gobble it down.,4
I have multiple cats and this product really does the job. No gross smells!!!,5

"I installed this heater, and in a day, it had cooked my fish.  The thermostat seems to have been not working, and the unit just continued heating at full blast until I noticed the water was considerably hotter than it should be.  At that time, it was too late for my overheated fish - they all died.  Getting a refund wouldn't even make me happy about this item - it killed my fish!",1
The item I received was exactly as shown an described.  I ordered it as a gift & was very happy with the details of the charm.  It also included a little prayer card.,5
it's ok,3
"My dragon didn't like the ""extra"" calcium on his food and wouldn't eat it.",3
Cats love these.  Even my 16 year old with bad teeth eats them.  So happy for I have tried so many other dental treats they would not eat.,5
"Our dog kind of feels like... screw this toy. I'm sure if we put some peanut butter and treats on the interior, he'd feel differently... but we just haven't bothered because he's been so disinterested. So it's just alright. Not great, not awful, just... more novelty for us, I guess.",2
I was worried my snail would arrive dead but he was alive and packed very well. Package came in a timely manner. My snail is doing very well and thriving in my aquarium. Does very well at helping to keep the tank clean.,5
Great product,5
My pup has separation anxiety that I am trying to reduce and was looking for something natural.  She is a cool little cucumber when I use this for her.  She is usually asleep in her bed when I get back now and never whines or jumps when I return.  It is a life saver or I would never be able to leave the house!,5
Different sizes in bag.  Dog loves them.  Would like to get more big sticks then little ones.,3
"The color's themselves seem to be well made with secure stitching, bright colors and heavy duty plastic fittings but the size was a little larger than I expected. I ordered the small but even on the smallest setting it was 11.5"" (including the buckle) which made it too large for my miniature dachshund.  Also, I would expect a collar for a small breed dog to not be as wide as these are.

I received this item at a discount for my impartial review of the item.",4
"This item is not 21.6 inches wide. I measured 22 3/16"" I.D. and 23 1/2"" O.D., not what the description said. Otherwise this product would be great except the wrong advertised size.",1
This product is the same quality as bought in pet stores but a much better price. Has helped to grow my corals large and colorful. My only complaint is the bottle leaked some during shipping. it did not lose much product however it made my other items wet and soggy.,4
This was a Christmas present for a large 1 year old puppy. I wasn't expecting much but this hasn't lasted too long. Shes an above average chewer.,4

good,5
"This is an awesome solution to the unsightly exposed cat litter box!  I had a place just inside my bathroom between the wall and my sink; fits nicely with the towel rack on the side.  (Take note of measurements first before buying to ensure you have a place for it.) Can place towel rack on either side if you reverse the directions just so.  WARNING:  You will have to have two sets of hands to put it together.  I am happy with it.  For me, it's multifunctional:  My cat has his litter box inside of it, so he just crawls through to use; and I have a table top with another surface just beneath to put things I need, i.e., hairdryer, makeup, combs, brushes.  I LOVE IT!",5
"I've tried so many litter mats.  This one is the best so far.  No more cat litter in the hallway, and it's large enough, and flat enough to cover the floor from the litter box to the door, and the door can swing over the mat easily.  It doesn't slip on the tile floor either.  It does have creases from how it is folded which, after 3 weeks, have still not worked themselves out.",5
They work well and having a pack I don't have to worry about running out.  I can order when I'm about out.,5
works great and a very solid product,5
Frontline does the job with no complications.,5
"I really WANTED to like this product, an economical alternative to the brand name cat-box pads.  But they are terrible - they last -at most- half as long, and the ammonia/urea smell is evident from the first use.  The name brand pads NEVER smell, even when WAY oversaturated with liquid.  The Ultra Absorb was a big failure - finally used them up.",1
"This week my dog has been sick the first time in his life.  He threw up all night and now has dia--rrhea.
The night he got sick I came home from a puppy training class and gave him a bunch of treats.  The treats were Lamb and Salmon Wellness.  I came to this site and read the bad reviews and threw them away.

He still has diarh----ea though and the only other treat given to him this week have been the Steak Grillers.  I purchased these high end treats from Marshalls or Ross.  They have been recalled because dogs are dying.  Apparently, the product builds up in the system and then then causes heart and thyroid problems.

I don't know which treat make him sick these week but both treats are on the list of treats that make dogs sick.  The wellness treat, however, never made him throw up or have diarrhea before combined with the Milo's steak grillers.

I hope he recovers.  I think the damage is done once it messes with the thyroid.

We have a 23 pound pug and the chin string didn't quite tighten enough to make the hat stay on his head.,3
system holds in the smell to the extent that difficult to open and clean and cats hated internal smell so much used the lid to do their business.,2
Product was as described and fit almost perfectly for my 37 pound boston terrier.,5
"This is a well made vest, built to last.  Solid stitching, quality materials and workmanship.  I appreciate the email from the manufacturer with instructions for assembling the vest, as it wasn't obvious out of the package.  I wasn't sure about the chest plate at first, but find it doesn't impede the dog's movement, and makes the vest very secure.  Once you have it assembled, it's an easy on/off.  Great product!  Buy with confidence.",5
Dosent really work that well.,3
"I dread cage clean down day, but not anymore...with this spray, it was much easier! It took me less than an hour to completely clean inside and out two large parrot cages. I just sprayed it on and let it sit when I sprayed the other. Then rinsed it off with water. The dried on poops and mess washed off with little brushing. I dried the cages with towels, replaced their perches and toys, and dishes...and done. The cages looked like new again. Thank you!",5
"Smaller than expected, but very cute",4
"This is a little disappointing.
It is a kind of pate,that smells good but is best for dogs who need high protein without much need to chew, such as older dogs or dogs with dental issues.
It did not have that real meal appeal I like to feed my dogs but others may find it a good choice as an additive to make meals more nutrious or just less boring.",4
"We have 2 very large Mancoon cats who were waking us up with loud meows early am...we finally took a chance and bought this feeder and our lives have improved due to it. I have had no problems with the timer or device and just placed an order for a 2nd one since our other cat is now starting to meow early for his own feeder(we feed them in 2 different places-high and low since one does not jump!). The one who we bought it for, starts his walk to the machine about an hour before feeding and just stares and waits for it to do its magic.

We use only dry kibble and do not understand the negative reviews we have seen.",5
Savory Salmon Feast - my cat's favorite!,5
well made size chart may be a little off but sure dog will grow in to it.,4
"This is a pretty decent cable that I use on my corkscrew tie out stakes. I bought two and only use them when we go camping. Otherwise, they're stored in my garage. I imagine they would eventually get cracked if you left them outside all the time. My only gripe is this cable HURTS when your dog accidentally hits you with it. I don't just tie up my dogs and leave them outside, so I'm always nearby when they're hooked up to these cables. If they happen to run around my legs or pull the cable against my bare skin, it feels like someone is peeling the skin straight off of my body. However, as long as you know to steer clear of the cables when your dog is running, they work out perfectly fine.",4
"My 17 pound cat loves this window seat. Was concerned that it wouldn't be able to hold him up well, but it held him up just fine. The velcro holding together the fabric in the back did not hold up well and you could hear it slowly rip open when he plopped his fat butt up there, but the fabric always stayed in place. If your cat enjoys chewing on plastic as much as mine does, keep in mind that the wires connected to the top two suction cups are plastic and your cat will chew on it if you do not cover it with something.",5
"I purchased 2 of these harnesses for my Chihuahua and Yorkie mix ~ they are easy to put on, and soft and comfortable on my pups.  They do not rub or chafe under their armpits or around their chest and are easy to adjust to the proper size.  I highly recommend these for your special furkids!",5
Great system,5
"Usually these are great and the cats love them, but the last batch smelled like plastic chemical.  Will not order again.",1
Arrived fast. Perfect product.,5
"My puppy, a toy Aussie Shepherd was in heaven when this arrived! It's now one of his favorite toys and he drags it back and forth through the house. Being just a little guy, that's quite a feat! Soft and plenty of squeaking! Not great for dogs who unstuff stuffed toys or rip squeakers out of them with a passion. However, my Dachshund (fits the bill) happily spent several weeks trying before he killed the final squeaker.",5
My cats are very happy with these toys and they can take a beating from the back feet kicks. Ha,5
Extremely upset. The product claimed to be 20 inches long and three inches wide. The product that I received is less than a foot long and not even a full two inches wide. The dishonesty is disgusting.,1
"The gate itself is fine - does it's job, but the spring that keeps the gate in position, which you have to pull against to lift the door up to open it, is WAY too tight!  Frankly, I can barely pull the gate up with both hands to get it to open.  It's nice that it's secure, and it's nice that it auto-closes, but it is useless if you can't easily open the gate when you want it opened.  It's impossible to carry things in your hands while you do it -- you need two-handed strength to open it.  I've had doggy gates for years, and never had one that was this difficult to operate, and from what I'm reading in other reviews, my gate is not an abberation.  For that reason, although it does its job well of preventing passage by kids or animals -- I can't recomment it",2
My doxie loves it. Great size and well made. You pay a little more for quality $30-$40. Wish it came with a removable cover because it seems too big and bulky for my washer.,4
Wont feed my dogs anything great item,5
The cats love this food and it is good for them,5
"The cut of these hoodies is way too low, especially for male dogs. I bought this for my Boxer, and needed an XXL in order to accommodate his chest and length... but the hoodie ends up being too long (and the XL was entirely too small and short), and he can pee into it if I don't roll it up his body first. Not a fan of that at all, so of course he's not wearing it anymore. A shame, as the idea is cute.",2
"Does it smell easily?
In my experience, not any more than any other scooping litter.
I use this in my rabbits litter box, and rabbits smell less than cats so it may be different for a cat - I never had a complaint about smelly litter boxes with this litter.

Is it messy?
It does get wet and soggy after pee, but I never had an issue cleaning it. I haven't had an issue with it scattering out of my litter boxes when the animal jumps out, which is great!

The litter absorbs pee very well and I can't smell it at all. I used to use carefresh which was extremely expensive for tiny bags - with carefresh I could smell the urine faintly from the start. Yesterday's news is a good litter and it hides the pee smell well. Though it is rather on the expensive side. I have been buying it in lack of ability to use my normal litter, it does fine but I will be switching back to my normal litter when I can. It doesn't last as long before it's time to change the box and the price is wallet breaking for me.",4
"My cat loves these, but they disappear so fast.  I've gone through three packs of these, and can't find more than one or two!  I feel like they're a safer alternative to my hair ties.",5
"The best thing about these is that they are VOHC approved. This means there's actually at least a small amount of research that proves it helps with tartar and/or plaque.  Other brands claim to do that but how do we know it really works or is just a bunch of marketing crap. If you've never heard of this, go to vohc.org.",5
"My one cat loves these bonito shavings. She makes lots of different noises and vocalizations to let me know she likes them whenever I reach for them.  My other cat also enjoys them, but not as much as the other cat.

These are good because they're natural and just shavings off of dried bonito fish.  Probably a lot healthier than most generic cat treats (also more $ of course).

If you really love your cat and don't mind shelling out the premium price, go for it.",5
Good deal,5
"Nice bounce, sturdy for my larger dog.",5
Best food ever. My frenchie loves this formula and really helps with his digestion.  Wish it wasn't so expensive though.,4
"Item actually says on the back... ""NOT recommended for large dogs or aggressive chewers."" VERY true! Since this bone is cooked, it will splinter if cracked into. My dog LOVED it and wouldn't put it down for hours.

Large (especially adult) dogs won't have much trouble with a bone such as this and will crack it almost instantly, creating dangerous bone shards that can be swallowed and cut into the dogs system or stepped on and cut into feet etc.

It is a heavy, tough bone that I didn't think my dog could crack into, but he did. He is an 8 month old, 60 lb. Lab puppy. He was able to crack it given enough time, but it lasted quite a few hours before he did so, then I removed it.

I'd recommend for smaller to medium sized dogs. Larger dogs or even medium dogs with powerful jaws (such as pit bulls) will make mincemeat of the bone too quickly.",4
buen producto,5
"My cats like it. They are both small (8lbs and 10lbs) but they do not fit in the top two seating areas (dropped 1 star). But I quickly fixed that by just flipping the fabric to the bottom and now the cats curl up there all the time. It was really easy to put together but the ladder did not come with screws and while the company reimbursed me for the missing parts, I have not been able to find anything the right width and length at my local hardware stores, so unfortunately the ladder is just laying on the bottom part looking out of place. That's why I dropped the 2nd star. But it really is a fantastic little tower for the price. Great quality pieces.",3
no negative effects on any of my animals.,4
My dog loves this food! He is very picky too!! Super quick shipping!!!!,5
These are total crack for my puppy.  I use them as my reward after my puppy submits to a grooming session.  He definitely acts like he has gotten the best treat ever.,5
Good one for two rabbits,5
fits,5
i foster a lot of kitties and this collar seems to help reduce stress behaviors.,4
Pictures are deceiving. Don't buy this bowl if you have a larger breed dog. It was too small for my 7 month old Lab puppy.,3
It doesn't seem to be very effective.,1
"This product works well.  I could see a difference in my dog's teeth within the first week.  I have recommended it to several friends.  Trying to brush your dog's teeth is a hassle and this product helps.  It does not appear to have any adverse health reactions.  It does not help with the bad breath as much as I had hoped, although I think that comes from chewing the bully sticks.",5
"Val adores his new toy!!! Flashing lights, squeaker and bouncing ball equals very happy puppy!!",5
"I was afraid my dog would not like this.  He used to have steps to get into a 2011 Subaru Outback, but the steps were too steep and so I was hopeful this would work.  And it has worked better than I expected.  I first taught him on a short incline.  These steps are sturdy so there is no bowing.  The are easy to open to full length.  My only issue is that they are a bit heavy.  However, I think better to be heavy and sturdy than light and flimsy.",5
"This has been the primary collar for my Boxer mix. I got it for him when he was about 6 months, and he grew into it and has been wearing it for over 6 months now. It's holding up perfectly well. It's made very well, using what appears to be high quality materials. My dog seems to find it perfectly comfortable, and I can see no reason why he wouldn't, unlike some lesser quality collars I've used that have had sharp edges or melted stitching that caused some wear on his fur. The metal hardware also seems to be of very high quality and shows no signs of wear after 6 months of being on leash 5 or 6 times a day on average. I would for sure buy this again, and may buy another in another color one day.",5
I have a lot of cats of my own but also foster and take care of cats that are sick and scared with upset tummies who have often been eating out of the trash.  I find chicken is best for my cat's tummies and they really like this. The size is good to feed kittens or a couple of adults so no need to store open cans which I don't like to do.,5
Works great for my dogs and the customer support is very good. They helped me install it over the phone.,5
Best product for dogs.,5
"Actually, I ordered this harness because my son had just gotten one for his Brittany and was
very pleased with it.

This is the best harness I've had yet.  It fits my GSP great, and it does not fit too close to the
elbow and armpit as to cause chaffing. My Lucy is very comfortable in it.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a well fitting harness for their dog.",5
"I was totally not expecting these to be as large as they are. The wire part is almost as big as a tennis ball. Usually when I buy toys like these, they are smaller. My cats weren't really sure what to do with these and almost seemed intimidated by them. I think it probably had a lot to do with the size. Past items I've purchased like these are much smaller and usually have a bell inside them along with the mouse type item. The smaller items are easier for them to bat around with their paws. These were just to big I think to really interest them.

The mice come out easily too, so you end up with a huge wire ball and a low quality mouse toy. That was all my cats seemed to be interested in, the mouse part.

Overall, these were nice, but I wouldn't buy them again. My cats weren't very interested in them.

I received these Catch That Mouse cat toys at a discount so I could try them out and review them. The thoughts expressed above are my true feelings on this product.",3
"Good quality, but nothing special. recommend the u groom Rotating Pin Comb!",4
Very fun! I have syrians so only some of them fit in the tube to go up to the loop but they all fit in the loop :),4
Had to replace this piece because of a crack due to me negligence. Exactly the same as the old one. Easy to put together.,5
I use this for my ferrets as an outdoor pen when I want to let  them enjoy some sunshine. It works great and is big enough that they can play around in it!,5
This chew toy is very durable. The white outside edges seem like endless fun for my dog. However the green silicone middle only lasted about a half hour before my pit bull had the green completely pulled off and chewed into pulp! But the middle has the tough white connecting it so the rest should last for a long time!,5
Sometimes plain and simple is best and that's the case here. This is a great comb. It's the perfect size for my 40# goldendoodle. I bought a trendy fur-brand comb and it does not do the job. This one does. I have another metal comb that has a ring on the end of it that gets hooked in the dog's hair. This brush doesn't have any add-ons that can cause problems.,5
set up easy. Have on front porch for our cat. He loves it when it is cold outside.. Sits in there ot manange his yard.,5
Truly great pet door for our GSD... and she usually tears up everything...,5
"It's a beautiful cage,  little hard to put together,  have to take apart to clean bottom of cage,  fix that I would give it a 5",4
Does what it's supposed to do....seems to be quite long lasting....highly recommended.,5
"nice thickness, color and size  but what is that ""lightly scented"" scent? Smells like a public rest room deodorizer- will definitely reorder but w/o the scent",4
"We have the duck and bunny ""super size"" rope knottie that I snagged when they were less than $10 each.  These toys are HUGE, not in a good way.  They are even too big for my Golden Retriever puppy (6 mo, 50 lbs).  Both of our dogs end up using these as chew toys instead of tug toys as they are too heavy and bulky for a good game of tug-o-war.  They have chewed off some of the smaller part of the face (eyes, mouth, top of head) and have chewed through the rope.  We have other HH products, but this one does not meet their typical quality. I would not recommend this toy.",1
Good product...my dogs just didn't like them as much as some of the other treats by this company....good nibbles for bigger dogs.,4
Good value for the cost and works as advertised.,5
"This is the best food I've found for my dog. When I got her, she was having stomach issues with the food she'd been eating, so I tried a few different brands, and this one was finally what worked. Easy on her stomach and she likes the small pieces. I'm happy that I can get it on Amazon because I don't live near a tractor supply anymore. Don't know what I'd do otherwise.",5
So glad they came out with Grain-Free Petites!! My French Bulldog loves these and they benefit her dental health!,5
"So I picked this as it was one of the cheaper deshedders out there. I have had multiple of the rectangle shaped ones with the tiny bristles and I will tell you this works 200% times better. It works on short haired dogs, cats, and long haired ones too! One stroke over my cats fur and the entire comb is filled with undercoat. It does not tug or pull and the animals love it. If you are in the market for one of these pick this one over the more pricey options, trust me complete satisfaction",5
"Dog beds don't seem to last but so long so why spend a lot?  We've bought much more expensive beds, but after multiple washings the covers/zippers start to wear, and the insides always end up getting torn up (not to mention smelling like dirty dog since you can't wash them).  These are just the right size for our 50-pound dog, Walter, to curl up on.  He likes to move them from place to place.  They don't take up a lot of room and are attractive.  Ours last about a year and then need to be replaced.",4
my dogs love it,5
I bought this to go on my Coolaroo pet bed to make it a little warmer. My dogs love it! they love the combo,5
Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.,5
It works really very good. My Dog has short hair so I have no experience with long hair dogs.,5
My dog loves this bed and will seek it out if I move it to another room. The color is excellent and it is easy to clean.,5
"LOVE LOVE LOVE that I don't have to take the lid off to scoop. Such a time- and mess-saver. My cat didn't like the door though... he decided he couldn't get in and went next to it... but hes skittish, so were working on that. The other cat did just fine.",5
"Given the price, I was very pleased with how small the grates were, and how well it works to pick up even the smallest pieces.",5
My cat just loves these things. I think she prefers then to human touch. She sheds a lot so this gives her a chance to groom in addition to the brushing I regularly do. She loved to be brushed!,5
"This Dog Food it one of the best on the market from my point of view, it is reasonabley priced,my dog have thrived on it. Garden Rose",5
LOVE this dress!  It's adorable and looks so cute on my dark colored Chihuachua.  It's well made.,5
"My dogs love it. They didn't squirm, as they usually do & it much easier for me to see thier nails. Also, the smaller size is easier for me to use.",5
I had to toss it in trash after one day. It came apart too quickly and I was afraid that it could be a choking hazard.,1
"Honestly, I would probably love this product except it is HUGE on my hackneys chest. I may order it for my extra wide load Morgan, but I don't think it would fit any horse that isn't *wide* in the chest. I have had no problems fitting my hackney until this point, but I would absolutely return it if he hadn't worn it. It stretched quite a bit when he was turned out in it & went from fitting well to dropping down his chest. I likely won't put it on again except in emergency or for very short use.",3
Works as intended. Great for combing and for holding the fur outward for trimming purposes.,5
"works great ,even the pig does not dump it over at all",5
I have used this box for about a year and I noticed that it has developed a crack in the side wall that leaks urine.  So now it's a big chunk of plastic that will live in the landfill for hundreds of years.,1
Dogs love these treat! They could get addicted! They like this flavor but it is a little messier than other flavors.,5
I always use it with every water change.,5
My Chihuahua has a bad hip and broke a bone as a puppy. This product helps her not lift her paw in pain.,5
I find no problem in the product itself.  Our dog loves the noise it makes and will definitely go after the ball.  The problem is that he likes to chew the fuzz off.,4
"Bought this for our guinea pig, Boise. He was a little confused at first, until he realized he could jump over the sides instead of walking onto the side and flipping it over. Goofball. He loves to snuggle in it, and with a toy in it, he usually spends most of his rest time in it. It has a little tether clip on the backside so we can clip it to his cage. First time we didn't, and he weaseled underneath it, picked it up, and moved it across his cage. He doesn't seem too interested in chewing on the fabric, but we leave a small chew toy inside just in case.

There was a small tag on the inside, like a clothing tag, that we had to cut off because he'd nibble on it. Ours also doesn't dip down as much in the front like the picture shows, it's maybe a 3/4"" drop. I'm guessing it would work with two pigs to cuddle, but at the moment we only have one (hoping to adopt a friend soon!)

Guinea Pig Tested. Guinea Pig Approved.

EDIT: A little over a month and a half of use, and a few trips through the washing machine, a seam has begun to separate where the bottom meets the side. We'll take partial credit, since I'm sure it doesn't like running through the washer, but I was hoping it'd hold up better than this. Knocking a star off because of the seam issue, otherwise we still love it.",4
"The bed is made of high quality fabric and is machine washable. I wouldn't change anything except I wish the bordered portion was re-enforce so my dog could actually lay against it. If he lays against the bordered portion, it just gives and he falls out of his bed.",4
"Yum, yum...woof, woof...from the dogs in the house, who like their treats.",5
Thought I would try this for a more affordable dog food.  But it didn't work well for my dogs that have skin allergies.,3
"My dogs liked the taste of it, but it didn't really freshen their breath to my knowledge. It has a very nice mint smell to it, but once it goes on the food (we serve them wet food) the food smell almost masks the bits once they eat it. We still have half a jar left. Worth trying as other dogs may take differently to the product.",3
"I have a cleaning kit from when I purchased the drinkwell fountain several years ago but when I saw this kit, I thought that the sponge on the end of the large brush would be useful and a good idea. This brush kit is OK but the brush bristles are much softer which may or may not clean better. I do not have an opinion on the cleaning effectivness. Both sets seem to work equally well. The sponge, while a good idea is not very effective and comes off of the end of the brush when cleaning in spaces that the brush does not clean well. It is important to keep the pet fountain clean but other brushes will do a good job. It is important to have the 3 sizes of brushes to clean the pet fountain.",3
"My Bull Terrier slipped and broke her nail near the top of the nail bed.  This stopped the bleeding untill I was able to get her to the vet.  It did its job well.

I think the product settles in shipment so it only looks like the container is half full.  It is still worth it.",5
works well,5
Purchased this feeder as one of our cats was knocking the previous feeder over. This one locks in place to prevent the back from being knocked off. So far it has been a few weeks and no spilled food all over the floor. Very easy to fill and looks great.,5
Was a great discounted add on...my dog loved em and they're healthier than by a great company!,5
Works great!,5
Puppy love it,4
"Great citrus smell. Leaves the dogs' coats soft. It's not really a spray, though...the spray bottle is deceptive. More like a gel or a ""goop"" that leaves the dog's coat feeling oily. It works well in small amounts on a damp coat, but not so well on a dry coat. I spray (more like a stream of goop) some on my hands and rub it into a damp coat after a bath, and that works well. Two sprays will cover one 50 lb dog.",3
"This is sized more for a kitten, but eventually my 12-13 lb. cat learned to love it.  Doesn't go into any of the cubbies unfortunately because they are too small for him!",4
Incredible product,5
"My cat has had skin allergies for three years. Based on the reviews, I tried it and gave her the prescribed dosage of one drop mixed with food twice a day for four days. Not only did it not have a positive effect, I'm fairly sure it made her itching worse as she - and I - were up half the night with her scratching. I took her to the vet today to have a steroid shot and she is currently asleep. Maybe it works for some animals, but I can't recommend it.",2
I WONT be without this EVER.. really makes a difference in my tank.. my fish are healthy and happy..,5
It works! I should've gotten a small - my dog is 10lbs but the medium size still works. I have a senior dog who cannot control her bladder as well as she use to. These diapers are the perfect solution.,5
Have them next to my dogs leash so it's easy to remember to grab on our way out. They have open here printed on them so no more struggling to open the bottom of the bag! They are bigger then what I need for my small dog but people with big dogs will appreciate it.,5
No issues,5
"Boo.  This lasted about 15 minutes before it had to be thrown away .... the little ""on\off"" switch for the squeak was such a cute idea in theory!  But in practice, it became the holy grail for my dog to rip out.  Does not withstand substantial chewing at all.",1
"I ordered this for my dogs and they love this.  They immediately remove the squirrels from the tree trunk.  It is very durable also.  It withstands my 3 Shih tzus, Lhasa Apso, and English Bulldog chewing on them.  This is remarkable, especially since my Bulldog destroys stuffed toys very easily.",5
"I have had a canister filter for 5 years and it finally burnt out.  And I have to say, it sucked massively compared to the Emperor 400.  The emperor has been awesome and it is super quiet. Plus, I can add my own filter media.  Just as a few others had stated, if the sprayers aren't seated correctly over the pump, it buzzes.  However, just fiddle with it a little and it is easy to figure out where the sprayers need to sit to make it all quiet.  Also, even though I have a 46 gallon tank, I used this one and I'm glad I did.  Nothing wrong with extra filtration.  Plus, priming the pump is easy.  No worry of air in the system messing with it.  It gets rid of the air on its own in a few seconds.",5
"I bought the purple one for cats, but it is the same ""brush.""

My cat has super soft, fine fur. It gets onto things and is hard to get off. Also, this brush actually works well on clothing and the couches/chairs, etc. IT is slightly tacky. Not sticky, exactly, but it attracts the hair in a clingy way. It's quite brilliant. Glad I made the purchase.

UPDATE: I had originally purchased a Four Paws Ultimate Touch Slicker Wire Brush as well. My cat liked it, so I bought one for my mom. Her dog and 2 of her 4 cats are terrified of the other brush. They run and hide if they see it out. So, I also bought her one of these and all of the animals like that. If you have an animal who tends to be picky, I would go with this brush instead. However, I got one that is flat on the side you hold and it is harder to use than the one I bought my mom, which is curved and fits in the palm better. All of the Kong Zoom Grooms have the same ""bristles"", so I would recommend going with a curved version.",5
And they come running,5
Great pads for puppy to poop on they are sturdy and hold up to big poopers,5
the illuminated balls are great for the turbo track toys and our 2 cats love swatting them along the tracks.,5
My 2 month old puppy loves this! He was quick to learn how to get the treats and loves rolling the ball. Great mind game and exercise!,5
My dogs LOVE little toys but are so destructive. These are work perfect for them.,5
"I've tried several cat harnesses for traveling with my cat -- it is just so easy for them to slip away and I like having a harness as a back-up. This is the only one I have used that really felt secure, and he also seemed more comfortable in it than in any of the others. I think it is because of how you can adjust it so it fits your cat's size/shape perfectly. I would definitely recommend this over any other cat harness on the market.",5
"I just love my umbrella.  It is light weight, so will be nice to carry on a flight.  It will fit easily is a med. size purse, and is only big enough for one person.  The colors are bright, and the Chihuahua is so cute!  The price was amazing to me, as it is the same price for this size and quality at Walmart, and I would expect a specialty, dog breed umbrella to be much higher.  It came quickly.  I am so pleased with this purchase.",5
"great stuff!  Much more economical than the ""wipes"" which I have also used.  Works pretty good on mineral deposits on the hood and light.",5
Too small and made cheaply,1
My dog LOVES these. They smell kinda nasty to me but he thinks they are awesome. They take him about 20 min to chew up when put in the accompanying kong ball (that is the longest any treat toy has ever lasted him as he is a phenomenal chewer).,5
"I always shake my head when people low score an item because it doesn't do what they WISH it did  instead of the product description. No, it isn't water proof, yes it is thin, no it won't keep an active chewer/destroyer from demolishing it. If you have a dog that chews, look for something like sheepskin or primopads.

I actually have a primopad in the crate, so the dog has cushion. This provides a very nice soft padding, he loves putting his head on the sides, it stays in place, and it was no problem to wash and dry. I'll be ordering more.",4
They arrived mostly dead and black. My dragons won't eat them because they are very active so they ended up being a waste of money. Very disappointed. I'm going to take my business back to Bassett Farms,1
Love them.  The pups,5
I did not work at all for my golden retriever. I tried to use it to untangle his hair (behind his ears) but I did not get any results :(,2
Great product,5
This is a good system.  It is hard to install but works well.,4
My cat like it,5
"As the other reviewers have said, does not eliminate the need for scooping entirely, but cuts in half at least.",3
"As much as I/my dogs love these treats...these arrives as ""CRUMBLES"".
It looked as if the treats have been tossed to the ground and kicked around.",2
"I have always used Prime when I do water changes.  I recently moved to a location that uses Chloramines to treat the drinking water.  Little did I know that while Prime breaks up chloramines into chlorine and ammonia and bonds to the chlorine it does nothing with the ammonia.  I did a water change and doing this caused my ammonia levels to skyrocket.  My poor fish actually had chemical burns.  I treated the water with Cloram-X and it was safe for the fish within a few hours.

Now this is the only product I will use for tank changes",5
"Wow, this stuff really works.  My dog was getting diarrhea.  I gave him less than a dose for his size and it would clear up after a day and a half.  Only problem was that it would return a day and a half later, sometimes on my floor :(.  Now he gets a full dose twice a day and housebreaking is going so much better!",5
This has worked like a charm for our new puppy.  When she wants to go out she just goes to the door and rings the bell.  It was very good training.,5
"When I purchased this for my six month old kitten, she was mildly amused to bat the ball but didn't use the scratcher at all. Six months later, I set it in a new room, in a pile of donations destined for Goodwill and guess what? My kitten, now one year old, found it and started playing with it. She now plays with it daily. She even destroyed the cardboard scratcher, gladly forcing me to order replacements. I would much rather buy these replacements than have her scratching my rugs. Great toy afterall!",5
This companies products overall are pretty durable. I have gotten a few of them. They are one of the few that lasts longer then a day. They last a while,5
pricey but my dogs love it,5
It only took him 3 days to tear it up......kept him away from the couch,5
really good for puppies and tiny dogs.,5
Hilarious........  These are just the right size for cats and small dogs.  Yorkies rule......,5
Great stuff. Lives up to its purpose. makes cleaning bile much easier. since i'm the only one in my house that does it....,5
"It was a bottle of 25 regular test strips, then a bottle of 25 Ammonia  test strips. Just not what I expected, but there is a good chance I did not read the description fully. But they seem to work, I use them all the time. Glad I got the Ammonia strips, I thought if you had no Nitrates you would have no Ammonia, but I was wrong, it was HIGH!  Everything else was fine.",4
"Second one that I buy from this brand, no leaks at all I recommend it 100%",5
My chihuahua absolutely loves this trolley! He has no problem pulling the pulley around super fast. It glides really smooth and everything was made very well with no issues on anything.,5
buyer is ordering a LEFT HANDED glove to replace.,5
Very messy!,2
The heaters are working beautifully. they are visible through the water. I like the fact that the temperature is easy to read and easily adjustable. some people have them in the bottom of their tanks. I have a 125g and I am short. So I definitely have mine to where I can easily adjust them and I've had to to reach the desired temp for my discus fishes.,5
"My dog loves this stuff!  I was pretty stressed out thinking about how I was going to gradually train her to get her teeth brushed and like it.  When the product arrived, I left the package on the coffee table, and pup found the box and ripped it open.  Good sign!  I usually brush her teeth every night, and it's always SO easy because she loves this toothpaste.",5
"As an add on item, this is pretty good cat food at $1 a pound. What a steal!",5
Hay had a lot of brown pieces and didn't smell fresh. My guinea pigs will not eat it.,1
my dog loves this,5
My fur babies love these!!  Will purchase these again!!  Love the Nutro Natural Choice Treats for all my fur babies!!!,5
Great product great price works great new and arrived on time,5
"Perfect for my French Mastiff..look no further
Buy this its very well made. Im very happy
****update one year later***
My mastiff loves his bowl and its holding up great. No peeling no fading no cracking..not sure why the other complaints that it didn't hold up well. Even with his drool and wet food on it it was fine. Make sure you clean around the bowls as you should and dry at least once a week. Again, this purchase was well worth the $$ and it looks great..just ask Tater he will tell you",5
Dogs enjoyed them and they will last a pretty long time - Very hard like a bone so any dog with bad teeth would have problems.  Our large dogs kept sharing the same one - even though they were each given their own.,5
My aggressive chewer was able to bite off chunks at a time. I had to throw it away for safety reasons.,2
My cats love it. They just purr purr purr when brushed with this Kong Grooming Brush. No objections to being brushed.,5
Difficult to apply and leaves a residue on out dogs' coats. The good news is that it helps as a preventative for fleas and ticks!!,2
"This worked for a while, but the bottom of it is heavy duty cardboard, I leaned on it too heavily one day trying to reach something, and it just buckled, I was bummed, I am not heavy weigh 135lbs, so I ended up throwing it away, won't invest in another one either.",2
These are working out great. Light weight and makes into a sturdy bowl.,5
Excellent!,5
Excellent,5
Good value on these romp n chomp refills. Keeps dogs busy chewing.,5
"These are really nice change to bones, that c as n be bloody.  Good alternative",5
"no matter what you do, you CANNOT seal it so there is no air leak, which ultimately makes it stop working.  Any where there is a area where water CAN leak, it does.  I had to seal everything, with vaseline to get it to work at all for more than ten minutes.  A rip off do not buy it.  I'm ordering another brand one now for my outdoor fish pond.  This one is a piece of crap.  I tried everything, T tape, vaseline, crisco, NOTHING would seal the air leaks.....it worked for the first three weeks or so and then kaput.  It is now in the garbage can, where it belongs.",1
Didn't last long - she peeled them quickly,3
Not really chewables... dogs don't like them at all,3
Two cats...a very large 15 pound male and a smaller 9 pound dwarf female. Both love this tree and typically stay at the top two landings. The very top landing is extra wide and is great for the male who typically hangs off of most of these trees. Heavy duty and sturdy. Easy to clean with a vacuum or lint roller...Best deal for the price,5
I'm sure is a great toy for some dogs but not for mine.,1
"I hadn't even thought of changing from my clumping litter box system until I saw this product in the Amazon Gold Box Deal.  Not one to jump at the ""latest"" thing, I carefully read over the reviews - including the ones dealing with on-going cost - and decided to try this product.  At $19.99, I thought it was worth the try.  I also ordered extra pads, but ended up not ordering extra pellets.  In hindsight, I should have ordered another pellet bag.

Once received, I changed out my giant 2-1/2 seater litter box for this 1 seater box and waited for the cats to take action (the instructions recommend 1 box per cat, and to throw pellets into the old box so cats can get used to the pellets - I didn't follow either suggestion).

I do not really notice that the smell is down.  Seems to be the same.  I do clean the box 1x/day minimum.  Smell wasn't a giant issue for me.  Tracking, however, was an issue, and this box does the trick.  There is no tracking.  So, for that reason alone, this product gets high ratings.

Haven't yet decided whether to add an additional box (that 1 box per cat thing).  Both cats seem to manage with the 1 box and I'm diligent about changing the pads.

EDIT (10/26/11):  We are now at 4 Breeze boxes and have completely switched to this system.  My only complaint is that the boxes are on the narrow side, so the cats tend to pee in the front because they find that it is tight to turn around.  The pads hold quite a bit of liquid & the pellets hold up for a long time. Changed my rating to 5 stars.",5
Love this collar. We have a very large back yard and our pups disappear in the darkness. So when they're wearing these at night I can pinpoint where they're at and if they're getting into trouble. :),5
My babies love Greenies and I love these because they smell SOOOOO much better than the original version of them. They actually smell like blueberries and my babies LOVE blueberries!,5
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.

Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.

In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.",1
Rabbit liked it and it kept him alive.  So that was a win-win situation.,4
Seems like this is pretty good quality and the price is way better than what the big box pet stores around here want for a large dog bed.  That being said it seems like every time I leave it ends up in a wad in the middle of my living room so apparently my Dog loves it :P,5
"I LOVE this frisbee! My mom didn't know I liked playing frisbee until she threw this for me and I ran after it, catching it in mid air, and brought it back to her. She went to get it from my mouth but I loved it too much to let it go. I hung onto it and decided to double the frisbee as a tug of war toy. Did I mention how durable it is too? I ran inside still carrying it and laid down for a good chew before my nap.",5
"corner tank?  Is it made to fit the corner and make the corner seamless? Or is it created to reinvented the corner look?  It can't fit anyway unless the corner angle is showing. Where should I put it ?????  if I put it exactly as it made which pretty much like an ironing head point toward the front .... it should NEVER said corner tank and called it something else like point angle something abstract maybe?

 It's look weird and it should be called something specially different than corner. And it's only for tiny small fish that don't need space.",2
Didnt last long before the squeaker broke. Lasted longer than regular long tennis balls. Too bad because my dog LOVED it before it broke. Too expensive to buy one every few days.,3
"One of my cats took to this post right away after just a little bit of cat nip was applied to it. My other doesn't really use it which might be a territorial thing or because she mostly likes to scratch horizontally on the ground rather than vertically.

The reason for 4 stars rather than five is because the base split as I was trying to put it together but it still works fine.",4
Good design,5
"Great ""refill"" product for my Doberman Pinscher... He tends to destroy all other toys..
This one keeps him busy off & on for a few days & refills are Cheaper thru Amazon..",5
"I am only giving this three stars because my cat wouldn't touch it - and I feel if it is so unpalatable, then it doesn't do any good. I even tried to syringe this, but he would spit it out or give me such miserable looks that I threw most of the can out.",3
Needed to replace an old worn color and this beauty did the trick.  Thinner so you don't notice it on the dog which is what we like.  Great collar.,5
"Not for puppies, he just eats the ball material on the outside. Get for a dog who does not have the problem of eating anything and everything. or an older dog maybe",4
"My dog loves this bed. We've had it for a couple of years now and while my dog was initially reluctant to go on it (when he was a puppy), he now loves being on it as it keeps him cool especially in the summer. The fabric and frame are both durable and it's only needed washing a couple of times. BTW, washing it is a breeze as you really only have to spray it with a hose or run it under the shower and all the dirt and grime from your furry friend washes right through.",5
Great supplement for my dogs hips!,5
"This unit has worked out well for our new puppy. She is a Wheaten Terrier and at 15 weeks can not jump out of it.
We put a dog bed in it and her dog toys and she uses it during the day as she is wondering around the house. When we need to leave her home alone we tell her to go in it and give her a treat and she is fine for several hours. We have watched her while we are away using our security camera and she sometimes is standing up with her front paws on the pen and barking but she has never gotten out. She moves the pen around some on the hardwood floors but it is plastic and does not leave any marks. She is 20 lbs now and quite active but the pen still holds her fine. When full grown she will easily be able to jump out of the pen but by then we should have her trained.

This pen has worked out very well for us.",5
High-quality Kong squeaky toy. Perfect size for my Yorkie!,5
bird didn't like it to much.,4
i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike,1
"Water clarity and quality never better!  Activated carbon is not the answer, Purigen is.  I have recharged multiple times and it works flawlessly each time.  Even if recharging wasn't possible, it would be worth replacing every time!

Another great product from Seachem.",5
The large size is perfect for rats and it's definitely preferred over the popular Igloo hideout.,5
"This works right when you spray it, but the smell doesn't last for more than half a day.",3
So far these have worked just fine to keep my baby chicks warm.  They are nice as they do not make light and the chicks have night without being kept awake.  That way is more natural for them.  If it is really cold I put a cover over the top of the brooder to make it warmer at night.,5
My crazy chi mix loves this silly monkey. She will 'fetch' it when I tell her to go get her monkey. LOL!,5
"Love these!  I normally spend alot more on larger chews but thought I would give these a try.  The bag is enormous...way bigger than I expected.  I gave one chew to my 45lb Terrier mix and one to a 75lb boxer.  They both loved them!  My terrier goes through chews entirely too fast and I think she finished this one in about 20 or 30 minutes tops, and the boxer took around 30-45.  They both loved them though and they didn't leave any mess behind like they do with some other chews.  I like that these are from free range, grass fed cattle.  Will definitely buy again!",5
"This is an entertaining you for both you and your cat. Your cat will chase it around and, if yours is like mine, will attempt to hold the string down with their paw and attack it (that's the hate part of the title).

Definitely will provide some nightly entertainment for your pet. Usually it isn't easy to get the cats to play but this does the trick.

The toy is essentially just a cylinder shaped piece of hard plastic with a long piece of felt attached to the end.",5
"Once I got my dog, I ordered some poop bags from this brand Pogi.  I was so impressed by their fast shipping and follow-up emails (with coupons and more offers) and the quality of their product, that when I was looking for wipes for my dog, I immediately searched ""Pogi Dog Wipes"" and this package of 100 wipes came up.  I love this brand!  They offer an eco-conscious product that puts the environment and dogs first; that's quality.

These wipes are very easy to use and the package opens and closes without a hitch.  It's easy to use these wipes in between baths.  I have a small Bichon/Poodle mix (approximately 12-14 lbs) and I can use just one of these wipes all over her body to clean up a bit.  As with most wipes, be sure to keep these out of your dog's eyes.  I am careful and use these to agitate some of the tear stains and then follow-up with a warm water washcloth.",5
Recommond by vet,5
"I bought this pack to help tire my high energy Great Pyrenees mix out on our walks. He is only 66 pounds but is very tall, has a very broad chest and a very small waist. I was a little worried about purchasing the large size, however it fits him perfectly with minimal slipping. We put a small amount of weight in it and it helps him to keep focused on walks. The fabric, quality, and build of this item are top notch. This is a great dog pack.",5
Wrong size and wrong collar.  Very disappointed.,1
My cat loves this formula. She switches between a few flavors but this is her favorite by far. She has a bit of digestive problem and can't have dry food. We've tried other wet formulas and and this is the only brand that she's able to consume. Plus we especially like that it's made in the USA.,5
"This gives our older guy something to chew on that lasts longer than the thinner compressed rawhide fragment sticks. The only problem is, we sometimes have to soak it in something tasty for a while, otherwise he may ignore it. Possibly this one doesn't smell appealing.

He hasn't had problems digesting rawhide, so we can't compare whether this one digests faster.",4
Best puppy food out there ! This is the only thing my baby Yorkie will eat & will not upset his tummy . Great price on Amazon better than the other store prices . Will order again ;) Great Value,5
"This is the favorite flavor and pate consistency by far of all of the Fancy Feast canned foods. I take care of 8 rescue cats who have 8 different taste favorites, but the Classic Tender Beef is number one with everyone. I wish the Friskies line would do an economy version of this because I go through so much of it. It's the one flavor that no cat has yet to become tired of, which says a lot in my book. Very consistent moist texture with no foul strong smell.",5
"Excellent collar, very good snap and it was a good match for the ITERY BUNGEE LEASH that I purchased to use with it, plenty of adjustment, bought it for our Gordon setter when he was 4 months old and its will still fit when he is full grown",5
My cats love the Blue Buffalo dry food but do NOT like the duck flavor.  They leave it in the bowl. I have 4 s& none of them like it.,4
"Cute, soft and perfect aside from the fact that there is no little buttonhole for connecting the leash to the harness of my hairless Chinese Crested. I can still use it, however. It is VERY adorable, and my little guy looks official in the black one.",4
Works  great for hotspots,5
At first this filter worked great until the time came to change the carbon right after it started to leak and has never stopped a total waste,1
"Well, this REALLY surprised me. I've used a lot of carpet and rug cleaners designed specifically for pet stains and spots, and this one out did pretty much all of them. Well, at least on what I've tried it on so far. Specifically, dog vomit. I have a whole cabinet filled with name brand carpet cleaners, all of which work pretty much the same and about as well as one another. The biggest difference is usually whether it's a foam or a spray, and what it smells like.

So when I found a hidden, already soaked in and dried spot on the carpet where on of my dogs had gotten sick in the night, I didn't think a lot about which cleaner I was going to grab. I've had a home full of pets for years, so spots happen. But I had just gotten this cleaner by OmegaPet and figured this was my chance to see how, or even if it would work.

My first reaction was a bit of shock. It cleaned up the unpleasant yellow pet spot perfectly. Better than perfectly. It appeared to not just clean up the stuff off the carpet, but then also clean the carpet fibers too. The cleaner didn't just release the dog vomit from the carpet so it could be wiped away, but also completely cleaned all the carpeting deeply. It didn't just make the carpet look like that around it. It made it look better.

I'm wondering if I could somehow put some of this into my big carpet shampooer and clean all my carpets entirely with it. The cleaner has a pretty strong (clean) smell to it, so I could see where doing an entire room with this would probably have too overwhelming of a fragrance, even if it was diluted in some water. But if they come out with (or already have) a cleaner made for use in carpet shampooers, I'll be all over it. This stuff is awesome!

Perfect size and my dog loves it!,5
"Works great, clumps well, happy overall.",5
"Our dog lost 3 pounds in 1 month.  We have a border collie that weighed 32 pounds.  She is now down to 29 pounds, so we decided to switch to our old brand.  I wonder if anyone else has had this problem?",1
I bought this for my 8 week old border collie. We've had it for 2 months now and he loves it. It has some teeth marks in it but it still works great.,5
"Just received this harness. Put it on my little dog, adjusted the side straps a bit and it is a perfect fit. The quality is very nice. I just hope the mesh fabric doesn't start to rip away from the suede trim as some other reviewers have mentioned. Perhaps the ripping issue is with ""stronger"" and bigger dogs who really pull at the leash. Time will tell.

As a friendly warning to others, I will mention that I bought a Gooby padded vest on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0142Q1NQW/ref=twister_B00DCPXJ2Q?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) that fits my dog perfectly but it's an X-Small. This harness is a Small.

So, I definitely suggest you pay attention to the sizing chart for each Gooby product and not assume that the size you may have ordered for another Gooby item will be sized the same as another item.

I am VERY pleased with the 2 Gooby items I've purchased so far and would have no hesitations to order something else from them in the future.",5
These are a great buy. Just like at the stores but more cartridges for a lot less money. Love It!!,5
Our doxie prefers this dry food over all others we have tried.  This is a keeper and I do reorder it.,5
Very well made & durable. I used this for my puppy & my mom's puppy and had no problems. I like how it has 2 doors.,5
"our dog just loves this toy and it has held up to his strong chewing, we had one before that lasted for many years. A good quiet toy",5
This is a terrible product! A washer and screw fell out the first time I unfolded it. It is heavy and has dangerous sharp edges not to mention the supposed safety latch is difficult to maneuver . Its going back,1
"My dog enjoys wearing this soft harness.  The size medium was way too small for her 32 pound size.  The size large was way too big in the neck.  I ended up keeping both but sewing a dart at the front of the size large - not difficult with a sewing machine (where the label is) and now it fits her perfectly.  I can clip the neck part first and then take each leg and fit her into the harness before I fasten the Velcro, and we're good to go.  Once she has it on, I believe she really likes it. She will even nap with it on.  The Velcro is a bit scary to her when I have to rip it to get it off.  But other than that - a good harness.",3
My dog loves it!,5
"Not for strong chewers.  We were recommended this brand at the store for our tough dog.  She had ripped a hole and had most of one fin off within 10 minutes.  We cut both off to try to keep her from destructing it further, to no avail.  The 7 pound puppy is good with it. Not the 70 pound pittie though, unfortunately.",3
Great dogs love them,5
It took my mini snoodle less then 5 minutes to figure it out. He only chooses the ones with the good treats and ignores any with his regular food in it. I am Still using it but it's not a challenge.,3
Very good product,5
"Received 2 giant healthy moss balls! Both are thriving in my tanks, no browning and the product was clean and free of snails and other critters.",5
Our Great Dane and German Shepherd loves these.,5
1.5 y/o Pitbull ripped it in 1hr 46 mins.,1
"I purchased the large size for my ~80lbs American Staffordshire Terrier (Pitbiull). The sizing measurements were true to fit, but because of her taper it is a little tight in the neck and loose in the caboose. Length is perfect, so I can't go up to an XL. I am considering picking up the same size Climate Changer.",5
So we have a a 125lbs high energy Bouvier Des flounders and he loves the stick toy.  He will play all evening chasing the rope back and forth.  We have had it for at least 6months and it has held up well. The one that wraps around the tree he doesn't pay attention to though..,5
Still had flees on my dogs after 3 weeks.,3
So far this toy has been wonderful for my puppy! I use it to keep my puppy from getting to the last 1.5 of his bully sticks to make sure he doesn't choke on the small piece while I'm not supervising him.,5
"Ball is well built I drilled out the plug  hole to allow for some BB shot to be put in there for noise! Heeler pup goes crazy for it!  Snow is outside, so she can't take it outside yet. She runs by and jumps off it to get it moving and she is only 4 months old! She herds it all around the house.

Update:
We have lost all our puppy teeth, and she can scratch into the side of the ball as she is biting and chasing it. She will actually stand on top of the ball, and bite down on it and it will move out from under her.  I just use a razor blade and cut off the longer pieces, but I didn't think this would happen!!!! She will have this for years no doubt, but I was truly shocked when she started biting into it and scoring slivers off like cheese in a cheese grater. It is funny how she knows that the bathroom is a dead end street, the kitchen tile moves a lot faster than the carpet, and how the coffee table is something that she can lap over and over again. She will chase the ball into a pine cabinet I made in junior high school, and I am afraid that she is going to split one of the doors in half. It is made out of 1"" pine, but one door doesn't make noise when the ball hits it, so she has perfect the technique to have it hit the one that does! I would also imagine come spring/summertime that the ball would be a bit difficult to clean beings I have all these deep scratches in it, if it was not cleaned up right after playtime.",5
So far this food seems to be healthy and my cats enjoy it.,5
its alright,3
Great toys for our new puppy!  Very happy.  Well made.,5
My finches love the food and it's a great price on Amazon,5
"Going to buy a 4th harness, despite the change in webbing.  Since Puppia doesn't fit him through the body as well as this, I plan to repurchase and get a seamstress to modify the length of the webbing.  He is more comfortable and looks better in this harness than any other.
UPDATE ON PURCHASE OF THIRD HARNESS:  I am disappointed to discover that the manufacturer has modified the webbing on the harness. The length of the web strap behind the metal loop used to be about 1 1/2"" and now it is nearly triple that in length. Needless to say it is too long and twists around his body.  I ordered a replacement from Amazon in case it was a fluke.  The new one also has the too-long strap.  I am reducing my five star rating to a three star rating.
---------------------
Previous review:

I am glad I ordered this, but don't expect Puppia level of quality.  I just washed it, and it came out very well.

UPDATE: It has been eight months now, and I am re-ordering for my 27 pound small Standard Poodle.  I did finally break down and purchase a Puppia, but was surprised to discover that it doesn't fit as well as this Casual Canine harness.

I have restitched the edge trimming around the neck several times, but otherwise it has held up well.  This old one will be saved for dog park trips, since he gets it grimy from hard play.  Definitely worth the price, even though it went up a little since my last purchase (but so has everything else!)

Also, my previous one was a lovely aqua color- great contrast to his chocolate fur.  I will be interested to see if the new one is the same.",3
I have a 100lb muscular dog who likes to pull and I am a small frame female and he has actually pulled me through mud before just dragging me on my back when I had him on just a regular neck collar. I was scared to walk him. This head collar has been an absolute life saver and it is like night and day! It does not allow him to pull at all and has trained him not to. I can confidently walk him now and he is much happier! Wish I found it sooner!! His head and neck is huge and the collar is very durable and comfortable for him. The safety attachment is much needed for him as well. Highly recommend this if you have a big dog who is stronger than you:),5
Ridiculous product. My german shepherd dog threw up after eating this.,1
"In anticipation of receiving the item I set up a jar for display. I was so excited because when I received the item it came with one large Marimo Moss ball, and two smaller ones. Instantly I plopped one of the small ones in the water, and gifted the other two with a friend with an aquarium. Now a few days later the ball has sunk to the bottom of my jar, and my buddys tank has both the balls on the bottom. I think the Marimo ball is absolutely beautiful and its simple enough that its not too much, but its elegance attracts so much attention by company. I'm so excited to have it. My friend also couldn't be happier for the live plant addition to their aquarium. Because of the low maintenance, and overall beauty I hope to have my moss ball a part of my table centerpiece for a while. The quality of health provided by this seller is superb because none of these balls had any health issues, they stayed clumped together and were a vibrant green color from the container, and only continued to get more gorgeous as they sank to the bottom. The Marimo Moss Ball has by far been the coolest product I've been able to review for a discount for my unbiased opinion. But honestly even without the discount I am by far impressed with the quality and overall genuineness of Aquatic Arts.",5
Just (barely) big enough to pick up after my 70# dog and get it reversed back over my hand. Just thick enough to prevent getting that unpleasant surprise because of an unnoticed hole in the bag. Just a little wider and these would be perfect.,4
"My dog loves this food!  He thinks it is a treat.  The ingredients  are just what he needed due to his grain allergy,  Purina has really improved their image with me!.",5
"I have a new puppy in training classes now, and this vest is working out great. Easy to put on, light weight, and easy for people around to see. As she grows I will definitely be purchasing larger sizes.",5
really nice bed for the price.,5
This carrier made Bears 1st cross country plane trip a breeze. Whether I chose to give her privacy or l her look around she clearly felt very secure. It was very easy to unzip just enough to pet/cuddle. I don't think you're companion could readily escape (unless you have a Houdini  HIGHLY recommend! ,5
I bought this for our newly adopted kitty who hasn't adapted to eating from the feeder with our other two cats. I also bought the matching placemat. It makes a beautiful set and I'm impressed with the quality.,5
My 72 lbs. GSD loves these. Good fresh product,5
"It's good quality, and soft enough but my beagle puppy, who is teething doesn't care much about this toy :( I hope companies will invent some toy that dog will love and pet parents won't waste money anymore.",4
"We REALLY like this product as our very finicky Yorkie will actually use it for BOTH functions & not do it to our Persian rugs for the most part!

The gel action is very pronounced. No liquid pools, but the gel does get cold. It makes for a Rude awakening when you plant your foot on one in the dark, but, it's only cold & not  ""wet"".

We have his on our subscribe & save monthly when we don't have tenents & drop it down to one every two months when our rental has tenants since a week's worth is now SIX pads in our main house & 4 pads in the rental.

One ends up playing hopscotch thru the peepads & putting words to an old song; ""Tip toe thru the pee pads, past the gel spots, to the com-pu-ter, OH, tip toe thru the pee pads with me...!""

The edges stick a bit, and he act of walking over one to five can cause some overflap so u significant actually STAPLES them to our carpet.

This works perfectly to keep all corners firmly down & our little Peecasso cannot wait to ank up on water to w art marking them, one the signifcant finishes.",5
"From my title you can see that no where on the packaging does it state what constitutes Ocean Fish.  That is a bit upsetting considering that Iams Sensitive Naturals is very expensive, even for a 25 lb bag!

Our doggie:  Furbie is a 15lb Cock-a-poo mix that struggles with big hard chunks of dog foods.  He prefers little bites and would even steal the cat's Science Diet because of the pellet size.  We never realized why it took him so long to finish a bowl of dry food.  It was the size of the kibble.  The second thing is that he hates cheap food.  I am not sure why this dog has such a discerning palate because he is the same guy that will eat trash and spoiled food.  Yes... he is a trash bag and we have learned the tough lesson of never leaving any bags within his reach.  Dining room table is also within his reach.  At the end of the day, if you buy him some cheap market Alpo/Pedigree (fill in the blank) he will just about scoff at it and give you the look that he will surely be dumpster diving.  Yes, he is unruly but we still love him!

Now onto this food... right before this he was eating a very expensive Sun Naturals brand only available at the pet store.  He was enjoying it throroughly.  When we placed this kibble he seemed to enjoy it as well and will empty his bowl quicker than usual.  I have found that he has not had any new growths on his body.  Before he had to have a growth removed from his face that quickly grew.  We have not found any news ones for the past two months.  I am not sure if the food has anything to do with it though.  He is not scratching his ears or chewing his legs as he did before, even though he has grown out his winter coat.

One thing that bothers me a bit is that his stools are so very hard, dry and a yellow/wheatish color.  It seems as if he is dehydrated, even though there is plenty of fresh clean water in his bowl daily.  The upside is that the stools also do not have an odor.  Not sure what that means.  I am debating if he will be going back to his previous food just because of the dehydrated stools and the price of this food considering they never disclose what Ocean Fish consists of.

Recommend if you understand that this is not a miracle diet and if you are willing to spend more.  Would have been 4 stars if it hadn't been for the bowel movement issue.",3
"fits perfectly, love it",5
"Easy on the dogs skin and smells good, in addition we've had no flea problems since ordering this.",5
"I opened the first can to feed my 3 dogs, as a mix-in with their dry dog food. Every one of them became ill.
I poured the rest of this pedigree food into a bowl and found a big oval-ish (think baby mouse or small dog poo size) lump of 'yuck' that had green and black running through it, and smelled like mold/mildew. Disgusting.
I was well aware that this food was pretty bad quality to begin with, but my plan was just to use a small amount as a mix-in with their regular premium food to make it a little more fun for them at meal time.
After researching I found that there are many people recently who have had dogs become ill, or even dying after eating this particular variety of Pedigree 'food'.
I imagine there may be a recall in the Pedigree foods future.
Either way, I will never use this stuff again...ever!
Back to the Newman's Own beef and liver. They love it, and we have had zero problems with it, in over a year of feeding 1 can every 2 days or so, mixed with their dry food.",1
"My puppies hated the car and even short trips were filled with anxiety and angst. This seat fits both of my yorkies and they are able to see out of the Windows without obstruction. It was easy to secure in the back seat and came with 2 seatbelt attachments to hook onto their harnesses which can be stored in the drawer in front. My puppies were much calmer and secured well when their harnesses were attached. Nice material, although a bit pricey.",4
I've used this toothpaste for years. it's effective and I haven't had a dog yet that didn't like it. the price from Amazon is a big bonus! best price I've found  anywhere.,5
"vet prescribed these for liver failure for my cat, and they either fixed the problem or it was a coincidence, but i lean towards these fixing the problem. cat tolerated them well.",5
"My 90 pound dog is obsessed with these. It is impossible for me to forget to give this to him each morning, because he begs for it each morning. If I somehow forget to give it to him and try leaving the kitchen, my dog jumps on me to remind me that I didn't give him his morning Dentastix. He has had this every single morning for the last 5 years and is a must have in my home.",5
"Our two 4 month old kittens absolutely LOVE this food. We tried Wellness kitten dry food, and they weren't too crazy about it, but they immediately took to this stuff! Not only do they love it, but we love it because it has extremely high quality ingredients and is healthy for them. We also love it because it is very reasonably priced for a premium quality food. We feed our kittens both this dry food and Wellness and Merrick Before Grain wet foods. When they're older, we'll definitely be moving on to Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul, because we couldn't be happier with this food!",5
"After only two weeks, my Labs coat is softer and smoother and I believe he scratches far less than peior to using this product.  So I'm happy with it.",4
Tiny opening for the cat's neck. My cat weighs 10 lbs and this wasn't even close to the right size. Immediately returned.,1
"Helped my orphan kitten gain weight and transition from formula to hard food. The kitten loved the taste, very pleased.",5
Assorted sizes. Would be better if they were more uniform.,4
looks like it should work. Have not gotten my dog to like it yet.,5
One good product,5
I'm terrible with measurements. Lol  I bought this to try train my rats. But I'm going to have to by a  bigger one because there still growing.  I did put this one in the cage and they are enjoying sleeping in it lol. This would be perfect for mice.,5
"To me this is the best product on the market for frisbees.  I have power chewers who love to fetch.  I try to keep them from chewing on them, but sometimes they play tug of war on the way back with the frisbee.  This holds up sooooo well.  Wonderful durable product.  You certainly get your money's worth.",5
dog enjoying these.,4
I love the product!,5
"These silicone bowls come in assorted bright colors and have a low-relief profile of a dog on the bottom.  They easily pop up and stay up until flattened because of the sturdy plastic rim.

They are marketed for pets, but would work well for humans, too, especially when space is limited, such as when travelling or in a boat or recreational vehicle.  The pleated sides and matte silicone make them easy to grip.

They hold 12 oz. to the bottom of rim.  They weigh between 60 and 67 g or about 2.2 oz. each.  The outside diameter is 5 1/16 in. at the rim, tapering down to a 3 1/2 in. base, and the height is 2 in. The little tab adds 5/8 in. to the diameter.  When collapsed, they are 5/8 in. tall and the set of four stacked together is 2 in. tall.

iVivo provided bowls for evaluation and review.",5
"Have used this product for years.  I have a Labrador with allergies and plenty of itching to the point that she will sometimes scratch herself raw.  She's on thyroid med and Benadryl, both which help.  But I can *definitely* tell a difference when she doesn't get her Grizzly Salmon Oil (i.e. when we go on a trip and it's a pain to take smelly fish oil).  Her scratching ramps up to about twice what it usually is.  Within a day or two of starting her GSO again it resumes it's normal (not too bad) level.  I'm definitely a fan of this stuff.",5
My boy loves it.,5
"This is truly a great product. The kibble shape is rather large and great as a snack for my dogs who love this! Not sure about the digestion as of yet, I'm sure they will have to get used to it more, but def. impressed with the quality! Use also Fromm, Horizon, Victor and Annaemat with success as well.",5
need more sunflower seeds in the mix,4
"Even though I think this is a little overpriced for what it is, my cats love it and it saves my hands from being clawed. They chase it all around and even drag it around the house, so I am happy.",5
"Well made lead, except for the clasp. The clasp connects easily, but can be and usually is a real pain to get off. I much prefer the standard thumb actuated on/off clasp. Got it in Blaze Orange and along with a couple of Nite Ize SpotLit Clip-On LED Lights it shows up great on night walks. I only use it for night walks because Blaze Orange is just too intense for day use.",3
The best food.,5
"I love these! The lids form a good seal and keep treats fresh. The lids do take a little pressure to ""snap"" into place but that's no big deal. They are easy to wash. The paw prints are super cute and go with almost anything in my kitchen. My set is a very dark mocha color, not the black that is pictured in the advertisement, but that's ok and they look great.",5
"I bought this ball for my German shepherd, I didn't read the size of it before purchase but my dog loves it. Really study, durable little ball, good for throwing around the yard.",5
"These extra wide gates work well for our hallway. Very helpful with the dogs who never even try to jump against them.
  The door feature however is much easier to go through for even a dog you would not thiink could fit. Our 25 lb. dog easily gets through which was a surprise. But since the gate was purchased for the width the hallway the door is not a nessassary feature. The gate works very well pressure mounted and  humans can go in and out, it's easy to get used to the open/ close mechanism.",5
Some of my cats love climbing into and relaxing on this plush hammock.  Easy to install and washable.,4
Love this light!,5
"It is almost like this monkey has been rolled in bacon - our dog just loves it.  I have really no idea why he loves it so much but he does.  He is a rat terrier and only 6 lbs but he just loves it.  He grabs the arms and swings it around and it seems to be pretty nice quality.  It is not small - like I had thought it would be - it is as big as he is, but he seems to really like that part.  I recommend it!",5
"High quality food that gives my Crested geckos an alternate flavor choice.  I have three geckos and they all seem to enjoy this food.  Banana/Apricot is their number two choice after the Rapashy brand followed quickly by Pangea Watermelon/Mango.  All the Pangea flavors give great balanced diet for my geckos, and they breed readily using these foods.  A small amount of food is mixed with water for each feeding so the pouches last me a while.",4
This works really well. I have no problems with it at all!!,4
one dog love it and the other got sick,4
"My vet recommended this for my cat during his antibiotic treatment. She also recommended&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Source-Naturals-FOS-Fructooligosaccharides-Powder-200g/dp/B00020I7LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Source Naturals FOS Fructooligosaccharides Powder, 200g</a>&nbsp;to use with this probiotic. My cat gets regular urinary tract infections. She says daily supplementation with both the prebiotic and probiotic will do 2 things:

1.  create an environment hostile to bad bacteria
2.  Coat the lining of the bladder to help prevent UTI

Great price on this product. It's a little bit of powder I mix with the gravy portion of canned food, and the cats don't seem to notice it. I have 2 picky eaters that gobbled this up for 2 weeks straight.

Oct 18th 2014 UPDATE

I stopped FortiFlora after I ran out. To help prevent UTIs I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pala-Tech-Cranberry-Plus-for-Dogs-and-Cats-60-Chewables/dp/B0021WXH8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pala-Tech Cranberry Plus for Dogs and Cats-60 Chewables</a>. I used the recommended dosage of the cranberry tablets for 8 weeks in my cat Jasper. It lowered the Ph (helps dissolve struvite crystals in urine), but he did develop a very minor UTI. I doubled the dosage of the cranberry supplements. The vet didn't feel antibiotics were necessary so we did the following treatment:

FortiFlora probiotic once a day
FOS Prebiotic to enhance the probiotic:

I checked his urine a month later and the infection cleared. I can't afford to keep him on fortiflora, but he is on the cranberry and FOS supplements. I will update in 6 months when I recheck for UTI.",5
"My dogs enjoy these treats because they are soft! Perfect size for a little snack but not big enough to add significant calories to pups diet.
I have 3 big dogs and these boxes don't last very long, but that doesn't stop me from buying them.
The all natural ingredients makes these a winner!",4
I strongly advise against feeding this food to your rabbit. Domestic pet rabbits do not eat seeds and they are detrimental to their health. They should not ingest them.  Rabbit pellets and hay is the preferred feed for domestic pet rabbits. This feed could cause intestinal distress in your pet.,1
"The dog loves it.  But then again, he'll eat almost anything foul smelling.  Will see in a few weeks/months how/if it helps his teeth.",4
Dog loves it,5
Fits the crate perfect. I have a German Shepherd who is 8 months old. I use to use a large blanket to cover the crate until I purchased this cover. He loves it keeps it dark at night.,5
"My Irish Setter loves these for her anti itch pill before each meal.  She used to spit out a pill when put in cheese, but gobbles these down.",5
This is really good stuff,5
way too small and the ball on the back of the head there is way too big it's huge and there's no way to take it off cuz its put on with some kind of glue so if you try to take it off you're going to make a hole in the material,2
"Our Portuguese Water Dog pup - now a year old - is the chewing-est dog either of us has ever had. Very bright, easily bored, as happy to chew on a chair leg when we're not looking as she is a stuffy. Which is what makes this ""toy"" so great. She absolutely loves it, and can happily spend an hour chewing on the bone and pulling at the cloth. In fact, I'd give it five stars, except I wish the cloth strands were a bit thicker - she manages to pull them out regularly, and sometimes eat them before we can intervene!",4
This work well and I hope it is as successful teaching my puppy. I think it's a great method,5
"we have one and it has lasted a long time - very long life for a cat toy.  One thing you have to watch is that as I wiggle the fish around to entice the cat, the stick part unscrews.  The stick is in 3 sections which is handy for carrying around and storage.  The cat grabs and kicks and bites at the fish, and it still has all of its parts -- fins and eyes -- which is surprising to me.",5
"I have been using this for a while in all my dogs food.  In the beginning it seemed to work for a short while but then they decided to go back to eating poop again. YUCK!! Oh well, just have to keep looking.  Maybe I will try pinapple.",3
"I received my leash yesterday and love it!  It is of the highest quality!  I walk my dog daily after dark and it is amazing!  Last evening when I walked Dolly, the cars immediately slowed down and drove way around me and my dog!  Someone came out of their house as I was walking past and commented on what a great leash!!  I have had several lighted leashes of lesser quality and this one outshines them all!!",5
The idea was nice but maybe its best to go to lfs to pick and choose what you like. I got three pieces which could only use one since the others were too big.,1
"I put this in the cat's litter box and it smells so good.  I wish it worked better than it does, but of course, I would like for it to take away ALL the smell, but I am convinced that nothing will do that, other then emptying the box every time it is used, then scrub the box and replace the litter.",4
Works well for our dog with acne.,5
"This things is great value.  Sturdy, easy to put together, and the cats love it.",5
I'm giving it a 5 star but my cat does not like it... Maybe yours will,5
Love this,5
Very flexible plastic.  Tips over and spills water and food everywhere.,3
"We have 4 dogs of all shapes and sizes from 9 pounds to 40 pounds! They all love the Pedigree Adult roasted chicken, rice and vegetables. They don't leave not one morsel in their bowls and they don't have gas! Whew! That's a wonderful thing. Plus, we like the zip lock feature of the food bag. It smells so fresh when you open it and seals back easily. Thank you Pedigree!",5
Bought this for my auto top off system in my reef tank. Works well but kinks easily. Not that big of an issue of you ruin the hose correctly.,4
"My dog was new to having his teeth brushed when I got this. I got the three sided brush (I should have just tried the simple one instead) and it's too big to actually use. Mind you, my dog is 80+lbs so he's not small by any means.

I purchased a two pack of children's toothbrushes from the store for about $2 and they work so much better than this toothbrush. My dog does love the toothpaste though so it wasn't a total loss.",2
"I first bought this at a vet's office when my dog got skunked.  After he got skunked the second time I decided that I better stock up, so I saved a lot of money by buying it on Amazon.  I also recommend that anyone in a skunk area also consider buying the large spray bottle, because you'll probably need to use it in the washer to de-stink anything that your pet touches.",5
"Second order of Rescue Remedy for pets.  Love that this is all natural, my pet doesn't mind the taste.  Sometimes I put a tiny bit on his head and it works like that too.  I originally purchased this for travel, but it doesn't seem to calm my dog for travel anymore (it did originally when he was a puppy).  I still use this for trips to the vet and to the groomer, and I can tell that he is much more calm and manageable in those situations.  Will purchaser again when I run out.",4
"Something changed and I received giant chunks of dried chicken.  My dogs were chocking on a bone twice before I had to toss this out.  It's like a different product, impossible to break apart and when your treat risks your best friend, I say no thank you.",1
"I bought these thinking they would fit better than plastic grocery bags. The answer is no. The first one I used tore 3 times. After figuring out how to use the very thin bags to keep them from tearing, I found out they tear even easier when you remove them full of cat waste. After they are gone, I will go back to the expensive waste bins. At least they don't tear, and the cat doesn't find them fascinating to tear up-they stick out of the bottom of the cat litter box.",3
"This is a well made, lovely collar for my boy! We were using nylon collars, but I wanted something a little easier to clean and more comfortable for him. Highly recommend this. I love it and he seems to love it, too!",5
Fit exactly. Last a year,5
I am happy with my purchase. Thank you.,5
"What I like about this food is that it is akin to Blue Buffalo Wilderness, but without the ridiculous mark up (to pay for all the advertising BB does).
It's a grain free food with the perfect calorie content and protein/fat content as well.

We have a 4 month old Rottweiler puppy and she is doing great on this food! Her fur is super thick and shiny, and she barely sheds.

I would always recommend putting a spoonful of canned pumpkin in the bowl whenever you are transitioning foods. This really helps soothe dogs stomachs and makes them ""regular"" during the transition. Different dog foods have different probiotics, which is often why we see the irregular poop when switching foods. This greatly helps with this!",5
"I got this because it was a sale, with my order, so I am trying it now, it seems to work good with my pup, it is not to loud like some other people said",4
"I really liked it, however, I needed one with wheels and the zipper arrived broken so I returned it.",3
Good product!,5
"love love this cute little bed, bought this for my moms cat, and she love it, so cute, fast service as usual",5
It works as advertised. The reason I had to purchase it is because the original vale broke. The lesson I learned from that is that it is important to treat the vale gently and never overtighten. I always disconnect it from the tubing and store it separately so that it doesn't get tweaked or dropped.,4
"Good quality rolled leather collar.  Looks good, well made and generous sizing.

My dog looks good in it, and, it doesn't mat the ruff around his neck like flat collars.

I am quite satisfied with this collar and its quality, after buying another cheaper similar collar and being disappointed. It is worth the extra cost for this one.",5
Great,5
"My litter box doesn't have the vicious smell anymore.  I love this.  I know these pads may seem expensive.  I never liked scooping litter.  I hated it.  I would buy plastic liners and toss the whole bag.

Now I just swap the pad.  Sure, these are pricey, but so is nice cat litter.  Cheap cat litter doesn't mask the smell.  I think this is a must have for indoor cats.",5
"Update on the door, like I said before for an EXTRA LARGE door it is barely large enough for my 80 pound Labrador to go through. It hasn't been a year yet and the flaps are starting to tear already. The customer service guy was nice, but when he said they had to approve the warranty, well that threw up all sorts of red flags to me. Usually that means good luck!  So I will see if they honor the warranty, It sucks that it didn't even last a year..",2

"My beautiful Maine Coon developed what I am calling a stress induced URI that was treated unsuccessfully, multiple times, with antibiotics over the course of one year!!!! I had her tested for all the major URI viruses and nothing was detected!! After about one week on the combo regime, her nasal congestion started to break up and her energy increased. At this point, she is still recovering and she is not out of the woods yet, however, I am thrilled she is improving. I crush the pill up and put in her canned food. Or you could place the pill in a pill pocket that works too! It's tiny. She does not detect the pill whatsoever, and no other feline is more finicky that her! One day at a time!",5
"Initially, I thought it was awesome.
This is a perfect item for someone with a small car and medium or small dogs. I wish I could find this exact item in a larger size!!
PROS: Cute, love all the zippers so the dog can climb in without damaging the door seal, and then you can zip them in. has strap to clip onto dog collar for restraint. My big dogs love it. It does keep the fur and slobber and mud off my seats.
CONS: Too small for my car (fits economy size) about 18 inches too short (door to door), not strong enough, my large dogs'claws poked through in a couple spots. After first ride (about 45 min) one of the zippers broke. When I had the windows open, the next day, 2 more of the zippers broke and one of the side straps broke off.",2
"WOULD OF GIVEN IT 5 STARS, BUT THE SQUEEKER DIDN'T WORK. MY CAT STILL LOVED THE FEATHERS.",4
cat will jump on these my cats are kig here thx deb,5
Love this brand of flea and tick med. Only kind I use.  Definitely need to check return policy with this company first before buying as they don't do refunds and got snotty with me. Customer service not good at all.,5
"Good quality, very soft not hurt my dog's neck is very sturdy and supports very well,this collar as it helps control my dog",5

"My dog loves this bone. Despite being a 17lb whippet mix, he tears through toys. He loves chewing nylabones and hooves, but sometimes looks for something softer - before these, he would start gnawing on his soft toys and we would find random ears and legs removed... Now he has this, which is softer on his teeth than the other toys, but steers him away from soft toy destruction.

My dog is also a shredder, and definitely is able to do that with this toy, but since he does not eat the pieces, we let him do it when supervised, because he just loves it so much. We end up with little piles of pieces (see photo), so if your dog is a shredder and may eat the pieces, this may not work for you.",4
"Our dogie seem to be doing better. Only used for about a week, will update later! If needed will buy again!
UPDATE! very happy with this(Tri Relief) cream. Have now used for three weeks and there is big improvement in her leg! She stopped limping a few days ago but i'm going to continue using the cream for awhile.",4
My cats usually aren't picky at all but I've only been able to convince them to eat these a few times. They also seem to be too chewy,2

Good looking & smelling and my cats love it.,5
excellent service to them are very responsible recommend shipments arrive just in time and some prior to recommend them 100%,5
Good,5
"Nice bed, my German Shepherds are loving it.",4
A must for small dogs or new pups! I could not find a collar that was small enough for new pups and came across this and glad I did. They did not mind it on them and it made it convenient to hook on their leash and walk without worry that they would slip out of it and get away. It comes with a leash which is a bit short but is good for vet appointments. Great product and price!,5
"My Bichon loves this toy :)  Look how he smiles! lol
The squeaky sound is different from his other toys. So this donuts is his favorite!",4
Works perfectly.,5
didn't fit,1
"I just received this surface skimmer in the mail and right off the bat it looks very well packaged, but one of the teeth was already broken straight out of the box. This is a bummer, but it doesn't make that big a difference. I have had the skimmer set up and running for about 6 hours now and it does a great job! Don't expect it to all pull of the water from the top into a canister without getting air into the filter. You can set up the skimmer to do this, but it doesn't work well with my canister filter. Setup was very easy. The hardest thing to do is to properly level it so that water will flow in from all sides of the skimmer. Overall, I really like this skimmer. My water is crystal clear and I can see clearly to the bottom of my tank from the top. Missing he 5th star because it arrived with a broken tooth, but it still runs beautifully.

EDIT: I have had this product for a few months now and it is working even better than when I first put it into my tank. Eventually the flow through the skimmer becomes very even. During a water change I left my heater on and burned a piece of the skimmer and the flow control valve. I emailed KollerCraft customer service asking if it were possible for me to buy just the parts I needed and they sent me a whole new skimmer in the mail a week later! This customer service is unmatched in the industry and I highly recommend this skimmer as well as any KollerCraft products.",5
Great BUY,4
Our kitten loves this food!,5
"As I have 4 Afghans and 4 dog beds, they all rush to this bed, I think it's because they can stretch out rather than curl. It is a sturdy bed and sewn well.",5
"I wish it had a little more ""spring"" to the retractable, but other than that it is fine and food quality.",4
"My dogs love these, but they don't really last as long as a bone would. In fact, my dogs can take one of these down completely in under a minute.",4
A little too small but works well for those 2 steps my dog has to climb to get on the bed,5
Really like this product.  Use it daily in my dog's water.,5
"My dogs love these. They always get at least a small treat when I come inside. I keep the small treats on the counter, and I keep these in the cabinet above the counter. If I open the cabinet door they know they are getting these instead of their regular little treats, and they go crazy with excitement.",5
"Just got this & love it already! It lifts the pet dander up & is very effective for long haired German shepherd. He hates the vacuum so I was worried about it, but he let me brush him for a long time with this. Only hang up is its a little hard to squeeze in into the vacuum cleaner.  Overall love it!",5
Works well.,4
my basenji/dingo mix loves these!,5
"I like that I am giving my pup a healthy oil. She is a terrier that has rough fur, but people are constantly commenting on how soft her fur is - unexpected. I owe it to the salmon oil. My dog is not a big water drinker which means kind of dry poo. The oil helps with this as well. I recommend this product.",5
"I'm really happy with this brush! I have one long hair cat, three short hair cats, and a long hair kitten and they ALL liked it! At first my oldest cat didn't like it but it turns out she just wanted to sit in my lap and get pets AND be brushed at the same time which is good because she needed it the most. I really like the feature where you can push the fur off the bristles because I always hated dragging my hand across the wires of the brush to push it off since the sound was awful. Definitely recommend if you have multiple animals/a pet with a long coat. All animals have their preferences, but for this price and quality, it doesn't hurt to try this brush out!",5

Best I've found and my old dog is glad I found a good replacement.,4
"These Resistance Bands are very portable and can be used anywhere.  I use them to workout in my bedroom.  The different colored bands provide MULTIPLE LEVELS OF RESISTANCE.  The bands even come with a ""No Questions Asked"" 90 Day Warranty.  I am very impressed with this product and would definitely recommend it to others.

Thank you for reading my review.

I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.",5
Nice quality and very cute.  Perfect size for kittens. I'm not sure if it will be big enough when my ragdolls are full grown at 3 years but I will have time to decide.,5
My cat loves this tree! It is very easy to setup. The instructions are very well written. Worth the money!,5
"Adorable! Surprisingly good quality, good material, thick and warm. Definitely going to buy in some other colors.",5
"As pictured.  My cat doesn't find this fun, so we gave it as a gift.",5
"for the  price, not bad.... but if your looking for durability to wear around your neck, look somewhere else. The hanging cross has already left dents on the side of the alum mental tub.",3
"Good product, fresh and flavorful. 4 stars because it came in a bag with a twist tie.",4
"I needed something to make walks easier with my 30 lb Australian Shepherd mix and my new 15 lb Pomeranian. This does the trick! They both wear step-in harnesses, and it works great with them. The Pom doesn't have very good leash manners yet, and I like that this redirects much of his pulling between the two dogs rather than constantly pulling against my arm. And of course, it's great only having to keep track of one leash and not have to worry as much about twists or tangles.

It is more heavy duty than I really need. Not too heavy for my two, but for a dog much smaller than my oversized Pom, I would probably opt for the smaller version of this coupler. I would be very comfortable using this on big dogs if the need ever arises, it is very sturdy and well made.

A word of caution/common sense: If the dogs get behind you, you do have to be careful when using the coupler that they pass you on the same side. If you're not paying attention, it could be quite easy to end up, at best, tightly wrapped up in the coupler... or at worst, flat on your back. Not that I'm speaking from personal experience or anything. ;)

Overall I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone looking for a product like this.",5
great,5
"I purchased this gallon jug thinking I could save some money instead of the 16 ounce I had been buying for my two Aussies.  The other Linatone formula...their plates are licked cleaned.  This one I had to bribe them to eat a little of the food I gave them.  It smells and looks different to me and them.  Thankfully, Amazon is letting me return as I only used 4 tablespoons from the bottle.  Told my husband if something happens to me....he has to buy the 10 ounce bottle with the lady in the purple sweater.  I received my two bottles of the other Linatone, and last night....clean plates again.  Fantastic stuff as long as I get the correct formula.  Their coats are much better since using the Linatone.",2
"Feels like quality material but color is WAY off. I ordered a pink on outside, light pink on inside of collar but it looks more like people on the outside. Very different color than the picture they included",3
"Catch me outside, how bout dah",5
"My dog makes the cutest batman. He wasn't a huge fan of the arm holes, but we've gotten over that. The cape is kind of flimsy, but it is what it is",4
Fish love it.,5
"I was skeptical about the claims, but after six months, these cats remain free of fleas which makes the price worth it.",5
We have a hefty cocker spaniel and I measured her prior to purchase and followed the sizing guide and it fits perfect! Love it!,5
"Got the wrong flavor!
My cat's gotta eat tonight so I have no choice but to use it.",1
They aren't made as good as they once were. My YORKIE had the squeker out in 1 hour. I have had the gila monster for over a year and it has lasted but the material on the new ones are definitely different. Don't waste your money,2
Little awkward to maneuver but all in all my pups love it,5
I love this collar. The citrus spray isn't overwhelming. It quiets my barks-at-anything-at-night-obsessively-for-hours dog right away. My neighbors are no longer upset with me. A humane alternative to the shock collars (DON'T BUY THOSE!).,5
"Only two ingredients! Can't get better than that. My dogs went crazy for them. Big dogs snatched them up and easy enough to break for my smaller dogs too. I have to say, they did look a little temping to me, but I refrained hahaha. Great treat and would definitely recommend to others.",5
"The cover has the perfect design,  and does afford the pet privacy and restful sleeping conditions. But the material seems flimsy...My puppy has pulled in a corner of the corner and was quickly able to puncture it with his sharp little teeth.",3
Is a good product and well worth the cost.,5
"What an amazing idea!  My little heeler, Kiah, is a food woofer and I decided to get this to slow her down a bit. It works!
She now finishes about the same time as our Shepherd, Pepper, who is a very slow eater.  Love this product and will recommend it to anyone who has a dog who eats too fast.",5
I had a previous larger one that died after 1yr so not too happy although it worked well when it worked. So I orders this and currently working nice and QUIET!! Woohoo!!,5
"This product is definitely great.  It is inexpensive.  The ball is indestructible, and it travels a long, long way so a large dog gets a really good and enjoyable workout.  With the chuck-it spoon, throwing is much easier and it does not wear out your arms.",5
dove loves it,5
"I hate cranberry juice, so when I found out they made something that works just as well for urinary health, and it tastes like chicken, I was all in! I'm not so fond of the consistency or smell, but by gosh it tastes much better than cranberries!  Thank you Purina for giving me a better option that I can even eat without my dentures.",5
"This does not work.  Yes, the dogs hear it, and continue to bark.  You can hear it, it's a high pitched sound.  Music even sets it off.....so no, don't waste your money.",1
"If you don't want a smelly cat box buy this litter; it's the best. Sure, it says ""unscented"" and it's really not 100% scent-free, but that's probably because it's made in the same equipment as the fragranced stuff. However, the scent goes away pretty quickly so you won't smell poop and flowers, ok. Anyway, it's great stuff because it clumps well and it's easy to clean out. I declump several times a day; in fact, every time I pass the box and notice it's been used. No one knows I have a cat until I tell them; they never smell the litter boxes, that should tell you something. Great stuff, wouldn't buy anything else. Here's a tip: after you declump, rake the litter smooth and flat. That way you'll be able to tell on sight when it's been used so you don't have to take through to find out! You're welcome ;-)",5
Kept ticks off of head and out of ears but still found ticks on the body. Frontline oil drops have not worked at all and we've tried several rounds.  Still searching for something that will work for their whole entire bodies.,3
"It's been keeping my 5 gallon tank at a betta freezing 65 degrees.

I very much like Wellness Brand for anything but my JRT just does not like these.  One sniff and she turned her head away.  We've tried over and over but she does not care for this specific treat.  We will continue to try but it is not looking good.  Wellness makes healthy and tasty treats but missed the mark for Daisy on this one.  LOL,3
Really nicely made.,5
"We buy mostly dog toys for our ""cat-dog"" since majority of cat toys are catnip infused and that's the last thing our super hyper kitten needs. He loves to chomp, bat and swat stuffed animal toys and decided to get this duck dog toy as it reminds me of him when he flops about on the floor. This toy is well made and our kitten is not scared of it. He hasn't chewed on it yet, but he does bat it around and carries it randomly in his mouth. It's one of his many new best friends in his play area.",5
"I have a fairly large male cat and he loves this cat scratcher. But it did not last very long maybe a couple of weeks. He tore it up, Even the design came off. Have to find something more durable.",3
"These compressed chews are so much better for you dog, especially smaller dogs or puppies. My trainer recommended to me and they were a life saver. They last much longer than the regular rawhide bones",5
Works great. Simple . Worth it,5
Worked perfectly for my needs.,4
"I bought this brush to use with my regular 'furminator' rake brush. I have two very squirmy shibas, one is 34 lbs and the smaller shiba is 20 lbs. Both really dislike the furminator because it pulls on their fur. But let me just say with this bristle brush it's like a spa day for them. No squirming, and no nipping at the brush or my hand ! They sit perfectly still and I can literally hear their ooohs and ahhhs as I brush them. As any shiba owner can attest to, this is like a miracle brush because there's no shiba-drama during brush time now!",5
These Bowls are adorable and my puppy likes it too. I Purchased Three Different styles for her.,5
My cats love this food much better then the old BB brand which was more expensive. Like that the bag is paper and can be recycled and the food is high quality.,5
Our black lab comes to us every night at 9 pm wanting a VeggieDent Chew.,5
"Its ok, I had no choice but to place this on the side of the tank due to no possible ventilation on the bottom without creating a hazard. Luckily this IS an option so I did it, it sticks well, so far definitely no issues but at the same token I do however still need to create other ways to keep my bearded baby warm. I guess the only reason I say its ok was in hopes upon purchasing that it would be enough but it isn't, Just call me a worried Momma. I love my Beardie & think if you're looking for something safe to warm them up, Go for it, The size & price I feel compared to in stores is unbeatable by far so given the delivery speed, usage, price...Get one!",4
Really the best cat toy. That it's not flashy or feathered or colorful just makes it that much more impressive. Spend the meager couple bucks and watch your cat dance!,5
"I can't give this a fair review because my cat, Annie, won't touch these.  I'm still working with her one that and if she continues snubbing these treats for a few days, I'll try these on my son's older cat and will update this, hopefully to be able to give it a higher rating.",3
"I have a giant-breed dog who's gone into a serious chewing phase in the last few months and I've been trying desperately to find something that will really stand up to her constant sawing. Bones last no time, neither do rawhides or Kong toys.. I remembered one of these from a pet store getting her attention a long time ago so decided a box full at a low price couldn't hurt. Throw one out here and there.. ONE has lasted over a week and a half and still isn't totally worn down. And it's really kept her attention, she hasn't been bored with it. I know every dog is different and others may not like them as much.. but for now this has worked fantastically for me.

Not to be total advertiser: They stink horribly. They make my dog's breath smell god-awful. There is that factor and I do worry some about her biting off pieces and swallowing them.. and like all bone-type things.. there are bits that get left behind on the floor that I miss when picking up that sound like vacuum assassins.. so watch out for that (obviously you don't want these if you have small children in the same area, not so much for the size, but sheer nastiness- yes they're gross). But I find it all worth it. I recently bought the biggest femur bones I could find, thinking they'd outlast these things and leave them forgotten.. she turned one into dust in less than an hour. So.. back to these.",5
Outstanding,5
My dogs LOVE the Jolly Soccer Ball! It is holding up well to 2 giant breed dogs and they play with it daily. Will be getting more for outdoors.,5
My dog is not limping like she did before consequent.,5
"You have to have a plug in that is high enough of the floor to keep the dogs tail from knocking the glass off. (That's if you have a dog like I do) Otherwise, it's awesome, pretty bright though, can almost be used as a lamp to light up a whole room. You sure this is on a 30W? It lights up my laundry room like a 50 watt bulb would.",4
My parrot loves this food.,5
"I bought this as an alternate bed for the window seat where she naps...however, it was sitting on the floor in front of tv near me and she has come to use it at all times of the day.....with its higher edges and soft interior she loves to curl up, to knead....highly recommend this bed.",5
This litter box is so convenient and easy to use.  My cat loves it and there was no trouble in her transitioning to this new box.,5
The poo machine loves to chew on these all day.,5
Worked perfectly!,5
"Every cat owner can relate to their cats tracking litter all over the house. I have yet to find a litter mat that can really get the job done. Our old mat was like a plastic ""grass"" mat that did a good job, but was awful to clean. And after one cat's diarrhea on it, we decided to just junk the old thing. Unfortunately we could find anything similar, so I say this one and decided to try it out. Its a rubber mat with small circular indentations to catch the litter. The mat works ok, but litter get tracked more now then it did with our old mat. The litter catching holes are a little too shallow and wide to really do heavy litter catching work. You also will have to shake out the mat every 3-5 days depending on the about your cat or cats track. One thing I do like though, its really easy to clean, and because it rubber, it will grip on your floor so your cats won't be able to move it around.",3
my pup love these,5
My dogs love this. Its held up real nice.,5
"The main memory foam cushion did not inflate, it is a wrinkled mess certainly not worth $99.00 the entire sofa is cheaply made. I am disgusted I made this purchase. It is too late to return or I would.",1
"Pretty nice. I have a six month old lab mix who goes everywhere with me. It works pretty well at keeping her from falling off the seat. I have a four door GMC pickup. I think it could be designed just a little better by having some kind of anchors at the crease where the back and bottom meet something like what a car seat has, but it is a well made product. It is a little narrow for a full size pickup.",4
"My dogs love them, no odor. Last about 20 -25 minutes for my 40 and 50 lb boys who are aggressive chewers. Will definitely order as a special treat but the price will limit how frequently I  order.",4
fits my puppy great and he seems comfortable too,5
"Love this collar, soft material.",5
"we have three of these, one for each dog! we stuff them with milkbone cookie treats and duck jerky and they stay busy for a while, especially when we are eating, stops them from begging. hehehe",5
"I usually love everything that I get off amazon but this was the not great. First it took a month and a half for it to arrive. Once I unpacked it there was a brown 5 inch strand of hair tangled all up in the tentacles, I know it wasn't my food kinda gross but it was gross untangling it from the rubber material. To me it looked like someone decorated the jellyfish by hand while drunk. The picture made me want one but now I regret the impulse buy.",2
I have two of them and will be getting a third one soon!,5
"First of all, be advised that Small is REALLY small. On the largest setting I was afraid my cat was going to be strangled. I'm not sure what the smallest setting is supposed to be for, a hamster maybe? Then the cone doesn't extend much past the cat's face, which would make it easy for her to eat but may not keep her from getting to where she's not supposed to. Good concept, bad execution.",2
"I loved the look of this aquarium. So much so, that after the first broke, and I was denied a replacement part I decided to purchase another entire unit to get it working again. Not more than 4 months later the same thing happened. No replacement part again.

Pros: (while it lasted)

Waterfall is a nice effect. I love the sound of water and you can customize the sound based on how you place rocks.

Cons:

Filter is fed from the top. My replacement Fluval View is fed from the bottom. This makes a big difference if you're going away for a few days. The open top design leads to rapid evaporation which I thought was great, until I saw how much better the water stayed with the closed view style.

Suggestion: Check out the Fluval View. So far it has held up a lot better. Bottom feeding filter makes going on vacation that much easier. I recommend that you check out my review of it as I go into the pro's and con's of the View Vs the Chi.",1
"This is a fun well made pull toy. My dogs generally destroy most toys and they HAVE tore the pull handle on this a little but not all they way thought and it is still in tact to play with. This is a great toy for two dogs that like to pull together. Two of mine have been pulling this back and forth for a few weeks! They go back to this one often and seem to like it a lot.
I review products as a hobby and service to others and I personally rely heavily on product reviews to determine which products I buy. Because I know the importance of honest reviews, I give my opinion based solely on my personal experiences with the product. If you take a look at my review history, you will see that I tell it all - the good & the bad, regardless of discounts received. I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and sincerely hope it has helped you make a better informed decision.",4
"I got this for my 78 lb German Shepherd. It is working wonderfully and it is the perfect height for her. The legs are a little flimsy, but, I don't have a problem with it. I placed it against a wall so if shes too rough it won't come apart. I've noticed that feeding times are much easier for her now and she doesn't eat as fast. I also noticed she is also drinking more water because it is easier for her. I highly recommend this! I was stressing about getting a raised feeder because the ones at the pet store cost so much, but, this is a great value!",5
Needed to figure out a way to entice my male cat to drink more water due to bladder issues. It took him a few days to gain the courage to drink from it and now he loves it. I catch him drinking water all the time now. No more bladder problems!!,5
A little bit too small for my needs but great for grass and resting places for fish. I have yet to try it out but will soon.,3
Nice light and adjustable with two colors,5
"They were ok, I didn't notice a difference other than giving my dog  diarrhea.",3
great product well made wish it was a little bigger to fit the whole roll of bags,4
My Aussie loves this toy!,5
"Very disappointed with this product! My small 8 month Yorkie mixed puppy had ripped open the toy just short of 25 minutes! This is one of the worst toys as far as advertising goes. Totally misleading the consumer. It looked like it was real tough but was poorly made. The seams that cover the balls inside were poorly made. Seems like they didn't consider that aspect. Kong has a good reputation for the most part, but they sure missed it here. Hopefully they will look at some of these replies and make the appropriate correction in the design and come up with a good product! Until they do, and notify us that a real honest improvement has been made, BUYER BEWARE!!!!",1
"I had order the chicken flavor before and my little dog loved them. So I decided to try other flavors as well (Lamb, Salmon and chicken) and she won't touch them. She won't eat the chicken either and she loved them before. She will eat other treats but not these. I don't know if they are old and lost their flavor or what but she will not eat any of the 3 flavors now.",2
Works great and the color helps hide the dirt.,5
"So far I really like it.  I recently started doing rally competitions with my pup.  We are beginners and new to it.  Your dog isn't allowed in the ring when you do the walk thru of the course, even if they are small enough to carry.  My pup is a 10lb poodle bichon mix, but doesn't like crates that are too small.  She also suffers from massive separation anxiety.  She freaks out if I leave her with someone.  This helps contain her when I have to move away from her for a little bit and keeps her calm enough until I get back.  She also likes to rest and play in it with the door open.  It folds flat and is very light so it is easy to transport.  It is a bit wide when it folds so unfortunately, it's not really portable if you have to fly, however it is perfect to leave in the car in case you go anywhere and need a place for your pup to be able to rest, relax and have their own space whether it is indoors or outdoors.",5
"I thought this might be the answer to our litter box dilemmas but, no. I have two large American short hair cats and one small fluffy one. I thought perhaps one of them might claim this but for the most part it stayed untouched.  They did get up on it, peer into it, and a couple of times use it. But more often they just went on the lid, which was about as much fun to clean as you can imagine.  So it is going to the garage sale along with a couple of others I have tried.",1
My kitten LOVES this scratcher. It is by far his favorite. He loves to play with the hanging ball on the inside. He ends up ripping it out pretty quickly but it still works as a ball on it's own. This is definitely worth the price.,5
"My senior citizen kitty has been on this for about fifteen years. She was having urinary issues and the vet suggested this. She is now 20 years old and has outlived her brothers and sisters. (They lived elsewhere and ate canned food)  The price is competitive with local stores, plus post surgery I needed it delivered to the house! I don't know what I'd do without Amazon!",5
"This is better for larger dogs.  The air bag inside the cover seemed to be a universal size that would fit a larger collar. Was a real hassle to get the airbag inside the tips of the collar. The collar material was pretty thick and coarse, and way to ""fat"" for a kitty cat when the airbag was 3/4 inflated. Guess I could deflate it and make is smaller, but the blue cover was stiff and uncomfortable. Try the Boobooloon, or better yet, get a cheap blue paper collar and put it backwards so the head is clear, but the collar prevents kitty from licking tummy, back, and rear. My kitty's morale climbed after we reversed the hood and he was free to look around and eat without problems.",2
"I've been using this for years, great product",5
Well made and cute!,5
"I have a golden retriever who is 9 months old and destroys every toy I get for her. I have tried all of the chew guard toys, which are the best for chewers, and can typically get about 2-3 weeks out of them. I have purchased 3 of these wishbones now, which tend to last about 1 month. She chews on them for hours every day until they are worn down to just a nub. I then throw it away and get another one. I highly recommend!",5
"Great product, I have two older dogs that are very picky, they love it",5
My dog loves these bones.  I like that they are easily digestible.  I've bought them several times!,5
"For a medium size dog ... not the soft puppy bones.

OK",3
great dog food....grain free...would suggest it for any dog...,5
I don't know what it is about this thing but my 5 month old kitties go crazy over this.,5
Very Good Product and Good Value.,5
I've used this pump several times now and for the money you can't really go wrong. I orignally made the purchase so I could transport some fish. I attached this to a 5gal bucket with a tube and bubblewand and it did the trick. I know use this as a primary aeirator for my bait bucket when I go fishing. It gets the job done!,4
"Whether caring for your own dogs and cats, fostering for a rescue group, or choosing equipment for your grooming business, this is an affordable choice that gets the job done.
With an ergonomically shaped and comfortable handle that has rubber gripper nubs on both sides, this groomer won't slip out of your hand.  Wider at the bottom and narrow at the neck, it feels solid yet not so heavy your hand and wrist will tire after hours of deshedding and detangling a pet's fur or hair.
The teeth are short and blunted enough that they penetrate just enough to tease out and retain loose hair until you push on the ejector, which slides a black plastic strip forward along the teeth to push the fur or hair forward and off into your hand.  Just go slowly and gently with a little pressure so it goes just beyond the surface of the fur or hair, which is enough to catch onto and remove loose hair in the top coat.  We found it to be a useful smoothing tool after a round of deshedding.
If you have a dog that has both an undercoat and a top coat, I suggest you first use a longer tooth tool to slowly and carefully work out the loose hair/fur in the undercoat.  Most of it will stay in the longer tooth tool so you can discard it, but some will remain in the top coat as it passes through it from the undercoat.  Use this tool to tease out and discard the loose hairs in the top coat, and then use it for a final smoothing down of the top coat.
Since we have 3 dogs, each with very different coats, this tool and the small grooming tool we bought from the same seller got a workout.  Princess is a smooth coat fox terrier who leaves quite a bit of her white hair around the house.  You would not think she sheds, but most dogs do, some more noticeably than others.  Princess is one of those you don't notice all the shed hair until you start sweeping or vacuuming or shaking out her dog bed.  Brownie in the photo is a wirehair dachshund who doesn't shed much but still needs grooming, especially after she has been out running in the overgrown part of the fenced back yard.  Victoria is a 6-1/2 lb mixed breed with long fluffy fur that needs regular trimming and grooming to keep it from getting matted and which catches twigs, plant seeds, bits of dry leaves and other debris because she is so close to the ground.  Add one long-hair cat who feels this is her house and we are here solely for her pleasure.  The deshedder helps remove her loose hair before she licks it into her mouth and swallows it while grooming herself, resulting in considerably fewer coughed-up furballs.  I recommend this as a good all-around grooming tool.",5
Love it,5
Fit my 8 week old German Shepherd very well.  We've been extending it slightly every couple of days. He'll outgrow it eventually but it's perfect for now!,5
This is the second time I am buying the same door. The other one lasted 14 years. The only reason why I had to get a new one is that my dog does not seem to understand the meaning when I lock the door. She will run right through.,5
He loved this toy and had fun removing the squeaker and filling. It kept him entertained for a while and now he just runs around with whats left of it.,5
"Great cat food with quality ingredients and it is lo-cal for cats that are ""too fluffy"".",5
"Be very CAREFUL with this product.  The yellow part (representing fins, I guess) came off right away and my dog choked on it.  Luckily I was able to dislodge the material.",1
"My dogs can't get enough of this stuff, it has made brushing their teeth easier in some aspects (they love the taste so don't run away or turn away) but also harder (they want to eat the tooth brush now because it's so tasty!)",5
I use it in my 35 gallon tank as I have a really big fish about a foot long and 2 little zebras.  Once every 2 weeks I put in the required amount but I make sure I take the filter out otherwise you defeat the purpose.  I wait about 5 or 6 hours then put in the filter.,4
Really quality construction and materials.,5
"Dog loves them, keeps his teeth very clean! I give them to him every other day when I am not brushing his teeth.",5
"I had a problem with my dog eating my cats nasty bits so I needed something to keep him away from the cat box. This worked perfectly and even provided a good defense against the cat box odor. On first set up, I put it together backwards though, which you will have to be careful about because the door will not work properly if you do this. Its a great little box though, my cat figured it out quickly and no stray litter anywhere! This is a great buy. If you even remotely interested, I am sure it will work out great for you.",5
Serves its purpose.,4
"Although my kitties won't wear this outfit, I loved how it looked on them for the fraction of the minute they had it on. I won't need to sleep with one eye open every night because I won't force them to wear it, but it looked super hilarious and cute on them. I had a nice laugh when they did wear it.",5
"My rabbit seems to find great joy in running through this tunnel.  She's 7 lbs and will lie under it too, but she sticks out the ends...so usually just her front half is under it.  She likes to chew on it too, but only does a little bit each day, so it's still intact.",5

Apparently, she'd rather starve.  After several days of barely touching her food, I switched her to the adult recipe.  Ah, much better.  The morning we gave it to her, she wolfed down the entire bowl, which isn't like her unless she loves it (or hadn't been eating).  Now that she's had her fill, she doesn't finish the bowl, but I can tell she likes the adult formula better than the puppy formula.  Go figure.",4
"We bought this 3 year old tabby we adopted.  He weighs 11 pounds.  He  is not overweight.  We can feel  his ribs.  He does not like the noise plus the bed flips over on him.  The outside, including the bumper is 19 inches.  But the inside is only 13 to 14 inches.",1
"We bought this first at a dog show.  Then we found it on Amazon.  I am not sure how well it works, and we are afraid to take our dogs off it in case it is working.  The dogs' teeth are never clean; but they are also not disgustingly dirty.",4
Quality leash.  Well made.  I have a rowdy pit bull and it really holds her and Ive broken leashes.  I recommend to anyine,5
"This life jacket fits nicely, I have not had my dog out in the water with it yet, but it fits well and I don't see that there will be any issues with it. Training time is needed though, my dog thinks he is being punished when I put it on him, so I would recommend taking some time to put it on your pet several times and praising them while they wear it to get them used to it before heading out on the water!",4
"Very disappointed. I have purchased many bags before. This bag had sharp pointed, shredded sticks. I would not give those to our rescue dogs.",1
Bought these for a long road trip for my Dog. The work well and the top bowl does not leak when the lid is on traveling down the road and th elike.,5
My pug absolutely loves these balls. She plays with them until I have to take them away. They are fun and she loves the interactive noises! I bought 4 of them because she loves them so much.,5
"My dogs LOVE this food, one has allergies and has to have a vegetarian diet, and I can't find it locally.  I was thrilled to find it online.  I've had it delivered five or six times.  The first few times were great, no problems.  Then I got the nasty ""old food/dented cans"" (see below) and was disappointed.  Amazon did a good job making that right, by replacing the bad order,  so hat's off to them.  Because my dogs love this stuff so much, I crossed fingers and ordered it again.  The cans came through new, shiny, with a respectable expiration date, no dents, no problems.  If I felt I could be assured of quality like this all the time I would give this product five stars, as I did when I initially reviewed this product.  I'm leaving the info below, to give people an idea of the crap I went through with that one lousy order, but I'm raising my review up to three stars, from one, because Amazon did take steps to make the problem right.

EDIT (THIS IS THE OLDER REVIEW, after I got the dented cans, which I'm leaving here for historical reasons)--I have to remove my glowing review because I feel as though I've been  BADLY  scammed.  I received this product quite quickly on a repeat order made just a few days ago (13 APR 13), looking ""dandy"" from the outside (all cans looked fine in the package) and when I opened the pack, most of the cans were terribly dented.  Worst of all, they were packed and shrink wrapped in a box with an EXPIRATION DATE OF 2005.

The problem was NOT with the delivery man--in fact, the dog food arrived cushioned between soft items (doggie wee wee pads, e.g.) in a larger box with a few other items that came through without a scratch.  The outer box was unmolested and was plainly handled with care--no breaks, crushed corners or anything of that nature.  There's no way these cans were dented in transit.  They were slapped into a flat box, dented side down, and shrink wrapped,  to conceal the fact that even the ones in the center of the box flat were dented.  What cruel deception!

I took photos of the dented cans and the UPC stating an expiration date of OCT 05, but I do not see a button on this edited review form  to upload these photos.  I will upload this revised review and keep looking for a way to show other customers the images--needless to say, I am very disappointed.  I was really hopeful that this was a solution for me, to avoid my having to lug cans for a dog on a special diet, but unfortunately my trust in this product as delivered by this method has been shattered.  I feel used and abused by Amazon, frankly--and if Amazon has been scammed by the provider of this product, I hope like hell they take action to solve this problem QUICKLY.  This is just ""not cool.""",3
"Bought XXL because my dog is too chubby for XL (90 pound pit) but now it's so long on him it looks more like a dress.
I wish there wasn't such a huge length jump or a size for barrel chested breeds",4
"This is our second gentle leader.  The first one ($$$ at petsmart) worked so well, I had to get another for our second dog.  Walking these two high energy dogs has improved 100%.",5
"My dog loves them and they seem to be working. I changed her diet at the same time, so I'm not sure if it was a combination of things, but she doesn't have anal gland issues any more.",5
This is a great quality tank lid and I love it. I will say that attaching the plastic portion to the back was a struggle but at least I know it's on there snug.,5
"Have a 12 yr old ""weiner"" dog who has aches and pains due to old back injuries. Have been giving him 1/2 scoop morning and night and he seems to be doing good on it. Anything that helps my buddy is alright to me.",5
My dog loves it!,5
works just fine on my 36 gallon...,4
"The kitties love the sound of the crinkle when I put it squeeze it in my hand. They carry em around in their mouth, stand up & throw the balls in air & catch em. (They really do.) Great price, get 4 balls & VERY sturdy. Id def buy from seller again.",5
Our cats love this!! Will purchase again.,5
"Very durable leash and beautiful colors. Feels very sturdy, quality and can tell it will last for a long time. We love having this for our female Pom with her red harness and collar. Definitely worth the price.",5
My Dogs favorite toy,5
Well this pet carrier is large enough to fit both my big ragdoll cats ( 18 & 22 pounds ). So I'm happy about that. It is a little more flimsy than I had hoped. I do have another brand that has thicker plastic and therefore more substantial. This one has many snap closures and appears to be able to contain the kitties okay. I'm just looking to transport them to the vet and back. So it will work well for that purpose.,4
"My dog loves this, it is really good quality material. It appears comfortable to him and it serves its purpose.",5
"AWFUL!! I used it TWICE before it ripped and my puppy went running into a busy NYC street!!
I have never been soo upset and angry!!
My puppy is 7lbs and with a few pulls and tugs, this cheaply made leash, ripped and tore right off my puppy's harness!
Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY and buy a ""heavy duty"" retractable leash that costs a little more, but worth it!!!",1
MY DOGS LOVE THESE TREATS! I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY ILL EFFECTS FROM THEM,5
"my dog hates it, the smell is not very helpful neither.",1
thank you,5
Cheap and accurate.,5
"I have used this twice so far, and it seems to really help with the sensitive skin.  He gets a bath at least once a week, and he doesn't itch like crazy after the bath anymore.  It has also helped to heal some sores that he gets.  He has extremely sensitive skin, and breaks out into hives.  This causes him to go crazy itching, and causes open sores.  This seems to have helped with the hives and such.",4
WORTHLESS ON SMALL PEKINGESE TEETH.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!,2
Love it!  My puppies sleep on it,5
This is the best rope toy I've purchased for my Lab - and she loves it.  It's holding up very well.,5
"LOVE THIS!!! Bought for our baby bearded dragon is it's really neat to have the lamp on a stand, instead of just sitting on top of her lid. Especially since my 2 cats really really want inside that cage - this way, they can't knock over the lamp and burn my house down while I'm away. Thank you for a great product",5
"If you have a multi-cat household, you really need Feliway! The problem is, it's VERY expensive at the pet stores and never seems to last the full 30 days that the package promises. I have a multi-cat household, and trust me, when the Feliway diffuser is empty, I know it before I even see that the diffuser is empty. The cats start acting up and nit-picking at each other.
I started using Feliway a probably 4-5 years ago, when I was having occasional pissing issues with my cats. We used to take our shoes off and set them by the door in this shoe tray so that mud or water wouldn't be tracked into the house. One of my cats was obsessed with sitting on our shoes, like he was some dragon in his lair of shoes. He would even push the shoes over to make a perfect shoe nest for himself, and drag shoes over to boost his lair. I started noticing the strong smell of piss, and the litter boxes were clean. I picked up a shoe, and saw they were in a puddle of old piss. The smell was indescribable. It was the strongest, stinkiest smell of rotting urine, it was gag inducing. We had to throw out half of the shoes, some were able to be saved with Nature's Miracle. And the cleanup was horrible. After the horrifying shoe pissing incident, I decided to buy some Feliway on Amazon. The prices were a fraction of the cost of what it sells for in the pet stores. The night I plugged in the two diffusers (one on each floor), the strangest thing happened. The house was quiet. Nighttime is usually when they roam around causing trouble with each other. The house was eerily quiet. I figured that it had to be coincidence. However, they continued to be much quieter and get along much better.
We tried our best not to keep putting shoes in that corner, but they would end up piling up after a few weeks. However, the shoe pissing stopped. After a while, I decided that the habit had been beaten, and stopped buying feliway for a month or two. Guess what? Shoes were pissed on!

So, now I always keep a diffuser going. I really should have a second going too, but even with the low prices of the refills on Amazon, it does add up. I do put it on my wish list for holidays and birthdays to help offset the cost.  I notice a big difference when I have a second diffuser going upstairs. I've read that using a vacation timer set to go on and off throughout the day can ""stretch"" how long a bottle lasts. This is something I really need to try.

But yes, this stuff really is worth the hype!",5
This is awesome. My husband and others were skeptical when I mentioned I ordered this. They didn't expect it to install so easily and securely or for our little dog to pick it up so fast. My husband also worried it would take too much room out of the door and we would no longer be able to easily go in/out with things. All things worked out very well and we all love this dog door. I definitely recommend this dog door.,5
God sent for the scent.,4
shovel just a bit big for me but good product,4
Nice mat.,5
This is the Only chew one of my dogs will consume.,5
Cat loves it! Now to hunt for more of the scratchers!,5
Works as it should.,4
"fairly well made.  anything coming from china is suspect though.  yes, rubber smell is strong out of box.  they sent me a bar that was bent and had previous scratches on it.  it would not fit in place and i could not complete assembly.  never tested with my dog.  then didn't need it because he was unable to walk at all anyway.  aluminum bars are hollow, but sturdy thickness.  it is appropriately priced compared to other canine wheelchairs.  i had bought the large size.  the wheels were big and sturdy.",4
"I don't get it!! Honestly, I am baffled by dog toys.  I have gone through probably about 30 different types of dog toys in a search for one that my English Shepard could enjoy for longer than an hour.  My search has ended with this snowball!!  Storm Shadow (my dog) has not been able to destroy this even after being left to chew on it after play and fetch!  He plays with it just about every day for at least 15 min (many times longer) and its still fully intact after 3 months.

The reason I am so confused is just like some of the negative reviews stated here I have reviewed a few toys the same negative way that others have found to be indestructible.  I guess you have to find the right match of dog and toy.  I have conquered this life's quest with a snowball!!",5
"Our three cats flopped all over this thing the second it came out of the box. Several days later, it has become the most sought after seat in the house. It is well made and attractive, and I especially like that it is more sturdy and stable than any of the other scratchers we've tried. It doesn't move at all when they claw at it. My only caution would be that you should take the plastic wrap off outdoors. I removed the plastic in my living room and cardboard dust that had settled on the bottom went everywhere! Other than that, a superior product from a great company.",5
"This is a high quality premium dog food that is manufactured and mostly sourced in the US. They don't skimp on quality, listing duck and chicken giblets as the first ingredient. Grain, gluten and potato free, it has a 79 to 29 percent protein to vegetable ratio. The bag has a resealable opening about 1/4 way down from the top of the package. Although it opened and resealed, since it wasn't at the top of the bag, it made it messy to pour and a tad clumsy to insert and extract my scoop. The kibble itself was small, ideal for smaller dogs. It had a mild, toasty aroma.

I have two Chinese Cresteds and a young German Shepherd. All three chowed down with enthusiasm. It was easy for the small dogs to handle. The shepherd inhaled it without choking but I do prefer larger kibble for her.

I like much about this food. The fact that it is made and most sourced in the US inspires confidence and the ingredients are good. It is expensive but their website offers a seven dollar coupon. The dogs enjoyed it but the small kibble and clumsy package design could stand improvement. Still in a recall ridden world, this one provides solid nutritional value and safety for the furred family members. Recommended.",4
THIS REALLY Does help with the crazy shedding of a  german shepherd! And is much cheaper to but it here and DIY than paying  $80+ for the furminator package at the groomer!,5
"Bought the two pack of jumbo size litter boxes. I am leaving a one star review, not because the extremely flimsy and thin walled boxes still had sharp points of plastic where it was injected into the mold during manufacturing, but because of the four large obnoxious stickers that came as part of shipping. Apparently, the seller was so worried about over or under shipping litter boxes, that they secured the two boxes together with FOUR of these stickers that do NOT peel away clean in any way. After 45 minutes of peeling and scrubbing with a hot soapy rag, I had all the paper removed but the adhesive is still there... So that will be fun when it's clinging to litter, dust, cat waste and bacteria. Someone with half a brain needs to look into product packaging.",1
"Even the cat likes this brush! Easy to clean, lightweight, and attractive. Looking forward to using this when our cat's winter coat is ready to be shed. Happy with the purchase.",5
My dog is not spayed and I use this for her when she is in heat. Very adjustable in size. It says this is washable but I would use attachable pads with this thing. My dog is about 9 pounds and I am unable to keep this on her butt all the time. It slides down a lot no matter how I adjust it after a few hours. But other than that it works as intended.,3

"Our puppy loves them, no grain",5
They are squeaky and they are colorful balls.  They shed a bit.  But they fly through the air and the dog runs after them!  Mission accomplished!,4
it works without stooping down to pick up poo!,5
My 100 lb. Shepherd/Hound Rescue loves this and he eats 4 cups a day. He has collitis from a bad case of worms and being a stray. Everything gives him intestinal distress - but this. He is gluten-intolerant so this fits the bill and he loves it.,5
"This is a nice item, but it is for a small, small dog, not up to 25 pounds as stated.  My dog looks very much like the one in the advertised picture and he's just about 25 libs, but it doesn't even come close to fitting him.",3
Use this product every time my dog gets an infection. Works great,4
I'm gong this to my two old cloudy eyed dogs and hope it will help. Don't know if the glaucoma is too far advanced or not.  Honestly I don't know how to measure if it is helping. The powder is fine and mixes well with the food.  On a practical note the scoop is ridiculous. The bowl and the handle are about 2ish inches long. The container is about 4 inches deep.  Because the powder is so fine that the scoop disappears into it so I leave it out to avoid digging for it.  It seems a bad shortcut when using an appropriately sized scoop would be more user friendly. I realize this has nothing to do with the product itself but it would demonstrate some thoughtfulness in terms of the overall product.,4
"This is one of my dogs favorite treats. I like wellness products in general. They remain moist which I like. My dogs are 8 and 10 pounds so I cut the treats in half so they do not fill up on treats. I use them with some others, as rewards and put in treat balls, and their interactive games.",5
"Sizing is off, large is tight around the neck of a pug, who is not fat.",3
"I used this collar 4 or 5 times the rubbers fell off and on some of them the prongs just went right thru the rubbers, and these prongs are not rounded.",1
My cat loves this!!! A must have for cat owners,5
I saw things.  I was expecting the cat issues but just moving into a new place I was not expecting what was on walls.  Hope it was a sneeze.,5
I really like these puppy pads.  The baking soda really helps to keep odors out of the garbage.,5
Great way to remember your fur baby.,4
"My dobermans play ""I got it, it's mine"" between the chicken flavor and bacon flavor.  They have a great time and these bones can handle their jaws whereas most chew toys don't last longer than a few minutes!  Yay!",5
Love this container.  Meets all my needs and is easy to use.,5
love the double set.  works great,5
Works perfect with the original unit. Keeps my door rashers away from the door :),5
I use this water decholrinator everytime I add water to tanks... And have seen the immediate (like in a day or two) healing benifits in the fish find that have tattered from fights.,5
"Bought this for our granddaughter in New Orleans so this review comes from her.  ""Thanks  Grandma. It is PERFECT!! It fits great and it's wonderful not to have to clean the car when we come home with a dirty dog who has been playing with his friends. The cover comes off easily to wash and be ready for the next play session.""  ... I personally like the pockets that show in the photo and is the reason why I sent her this specific one. I have the AKC ones for our cars and they do not have pockets.",5
My bird hated this but the quality of it is really good and totally worth 5 stars,5
"I have two different breeds of dog. They are both adult and I feed them the same food. One dog is over 60 pounds while the other is under 10 pounds. This Kibble is small enough for the small dog and large enough for the big dog. That's a minor point, but important nonetheless.

Since I started blending this food with their normal  - also grain-free - food to see if they liked it - and to avoid their stomachs and bowls not dealing well with a new food - I've seen very good results. Their stools are solid and firm. They also seem to really like the food. Ever since I stopped feeding foods with grain my dogs have never been finicky. They eat their food and they eat less of it so because they get more nutrition, which means the food lasts longer.

UPDATE: After a couple days of feeding them this food they started vomiting it up and having terrible diareaha. When I took them off the food and put them back on their regular food - all was well with them again.

I believe it must be too rich for their systems.

Won't be buying this again.

I'm still feeding the food and I will update further if anything different happens. But right now, I'm a happy camper and so are my dogs.",2
Great bowl for dogs that have trouble getting to the creases of the bowl.,5
very comfortable and a bargain price,5
great!,5
Treats were harder than I expected and were hard for the cats to chew,4
Really good product.  It's sturdy for rambunctious dogs. I like it better then a crate.  Some dogs may jump out though. I have two and love that is adjustable.,5
"Really nice collar! Nicely made, great colors! Can really tell it is quality! Will last for years to come. The medium fits my Border Collie nicely!",5
Had to return. Too small,4

"this is one of our ferrets favorite toys. they run and chase each other, climb over and generaly have a great time with the tube. has advantages over dryer tube, the plastic seems thicker and it is clear so they can see each other run through. Great fun for the ferrets to play in and you to watch. have seen people attach these to the edge of their stairway so it makes a 20' slide for the fuzzbutts.",5
My dog loves them,5
My dog hated this food. I could have switched the food incorrectly but he went on a hunger strike for 2 weeks and would hardly touch this food. Switched back to his old food and he is eating it just fine. Could be the dog but i am not happy with the product.,1
"Comes without the holder box shown and promised in the advertisement.  A rolled piece of sod that had split the cheap plastic bag it was in, leaked through the shipping box, and was falling apart as I carried it up to the house.  It seems like decent grass, not sure yet of the dog will learn to use it, but I got myself filthy trying to lay enough plastic garbage bags under the thing to contain the mess, and it is still leaking into the porch.  Thank goodness I did not plan to put this inside the house!",1
This item does not fit my cage in addition to the fact it does not stay on once clipped. The top portion of the bird bath does not stay on the bottom portion. It pops off. This is dangerous as that allows my birds to escape. Honestly this product is a failure.,1
All of the cats I have owned love this food.,5
Like this but it is not made well. Its already falling apart and I have not been hard on it. Helps keep the box hidden though which I love.,3
Just the perfect gravel with those deep rich earth tones to compliment your aquarium or craft project. I'm super happy with this purchase. I am using it in two 1.8 gallon waterfall aquariums and I had enough for both of them.,5
I'm pretty sure I could teach my dog to walk a tightrope or ride an elephant with these! Lol! I've taken to calling them Dognip because my dog goes crazy for these. I am now a dedicated Customer. :),5

"Fit our 17 LB bichon about perfectly. It's a bit loose on him, but he loves it.",5
"Solid product. Good Price. Fills one medium litter box. I need to buy larger sizes in the future, but no complaints about the product itself.",4
Our dog loves these and they don't make her gain weight.,5
"Nicely made leash but not as soft as I would have liked. It's stiff after quite a while of use. If you need a good working leash this is fine, but if you are a true working dog person, skip this one pay more and get a higher quality.",3
These work well. My vet said this is the best way to transport a large breed puppy and dog. I watched some scary video about crates busting apart and being death traps in the car so we felt even better about this purchase.,5
"the lid/bowl doesn't attach securely to the bottle so it leaks. Also, because the lid's not tight, you can't use the loop that's on it to hook it to anything.",2
Great little mat. Cute paw details...very excited for this purchase!,5
"Gave two of these to my dog last evening, worse gas all night!  she has never had gas before.",1
Easy to put together and sturdy.  I have one cat who is large and fat.  She gets all the way to the top and the cat tree is stable. It is a BIG kat condo.  72 inches tall. You need room for it.,5
"My dog just love these treats.  He's a finicky eater so getting him to eat his food is a challenge.  Whenever I have these around he constantly wants more and can't get enough.  I sometimes cut them into small pieces and put into his food to encourage him to eat and the ploy actually
works.  I'm glad I have these for him and no complaints from me and certainly not from my dog.",5
"I went through six dog foods from store-brands to natural until finding Canidae. This brand was recommended to me on an online German Shepherd Dog forum. Dozens of people loved it. My girl has a sensitive stomach, so I mix a large table spoon of the wet food into 2 cups of dry in the morning and at night. Any more of the wet food and her stomach reacts, but she loves the taste of the canned mixed with the bits. This online price (if you have Amazon Prime) is less expensive than going to the grain store, which is the only place I can find this brand. It equals out considering time spent + gas. For me, one can lasts 2 days, so it's a killer deal. Overall, great natural food for a sensitive breed of dog.",5
"The outer layer was ripped off in moments when my dog got ahold of them. He started to easily tear through the rubber underneath and I had to pick out the little pieces from our carpet and keep him from swallowing them, too. The squeaker inside was great while it lasted. It caught his attention easily to keep him interested in fetch.",1
I love this 2 mat set.  I use the bigger one for under my cats food and water fountain.  The smaller one is perfect for the front of the litter box.  I am so glad I chose these.,5
Cat liked it for about 5 minutes the lost interest and so did I (LOL) Got kinda old going to get it each time I let it go and she just looked at me as to say **seriously** we are not going to do this again.,3
cat loves it,5
"This harness requires adjustment of the front/neck section after it goes over the dog's head, which means it is not easy to take on and off.  It is nice and lightweight, but that, in combination with the need to leave it on the dog, meant that it was a bad combination for a teething puppy.  Our 3 month old puppy easily chewed through the chest strap connecting the neck and abdomen strap.  It was impractical to take this off repeatedly, as we needed to be able to take the dog outside quickly for house training purposes.  Looks like a nice harness for a non-chewer.",3
"I bought this for my rescue puppy who was eating his food in seconds. As a large breed puppy I was concerned with bloat. This is a great feeder, it also gives my other dogs some time to finish their food. it's also a great boredom buster if I am busy & want to keep him occupied for a couple of minutes. I throw a handful in & it keeps him occupied for at least 15-20 mins. I highly recommend it.",5
This collar is excellent.  It's amazing how she responds just by using the vibration and I've only used the shock once.  Would buy again.,5
Keeps my pet business and his teeth clean.,5
NOT HOW IT USED TO BE. THE QUALITY IS SO LOW NOW. NEVER AGAIN MARINE-LAND IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT BUY.,2
Perfect for my dachshund!  She loves it and the leash ring makes it easy.,5
"*** Update***

I finally got the metal taste out of it and it doesnt make her cough anymore. So boosting my rating from 2 to 4 stars. It would be 5 if that hadnt taken so long. 

I love the idea of this product. It was easy to use and I loved having an easy way for my dog to drink water on our walks. The problem is that it makes the water taste like metal. Even after several thorough washes the water still tastes like metal. This makes my dog cough. Every time she drank the water from this bottle she would cough pretty badly. I thought that maybe it was because the water was cold so I tried it with room temperature water and the end result was the same. If that was fixed this would be a great product.",4
"Cute enough, but does not fit well, as it shifts while on the dog. The plastic lock is large and hard to engage.",3
GREAT FOR KITTY,5
"This clipper is very well built (American, not Chinese surprisingly) and cuts very nicely. A very good investment, you'll probably never need to buy another one",5
"My dogs like it and the ingredients sound good, better than many!",5
"might be good but think scent is to strong for my pandabear, she got sick",2
"My lab absolutely loves this toy! She'd chase it all day if I let her and it's soft, so no worries about it bonking her in the face. She has a bad habit of wanting to play tug with it when she brings it back to me, so initially I was afraid it would rip. But it hasn't and so far shows no signs of wear at all. Those Kong folks really do it right for big dogs with big teeth with their extreme items! I won't say they're indestructible but they come pretty darn close.",5
"My geriatric cat stopped using the litter box,  instead going on the floor beside it.  I purchased this box in hopes that it being wide with a low step to get inside would suit him better. He hasn't had a single accident in the months since I purchased this box!  I would highly recommend it.  Very sturdy and perfect for large cats.",5
"I love this system.  I have 11 cats, 4 that stay outside and the others go in and out.  Still, they want to use the litter box inside....cats!  I was leery of this but I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, it has been wonderful.  The urine really does flow through to the pad and only bowel movements are left in the ""litter"" (the stuff that comes with the system).  It is so easy to clean.....just slide out the drawer and replace the pad when needed and no urine smell!  The kit comes with a scoop and it works great to remove the solids on top/inside the box .  I would recommend this to anyone with cats.  Someone with fewer cats than I have, I'm sure, will find it even easier than I have with all of my cats.",5
"Very pretty, great quality!",5
"Three weeks in, doesnt seem to be doing anything good or bad. ill continue for a couple months and re review.",3
Great Product.,5
"This was highly rated and I would totally agree except that it didn't fit my dog, despite the measurements given.  Actually the measurements are accurate, but they just don't make a size for a medium to largish dog that has a large girth.  (He's a Schnocker - mix of Schnauzer and Cocker)  The large was much  too long along his back and big at the neck;  the medium was perfect for the length and neck, but too small girth.  I'm sticking with the medium and trying to sew on another panel for the girth.....

I bought this in order for my dog to better enjoy his water therapy in my hot tub.  Only problem is that it works too well!!  He practically floats along and after realizing that, he quit paddling his rear legs.  Which was the whole point of the therapy....  So - I can definitely recommend this vest for a boat as a safety measure~

And the price is fantastic for the quality.",4
Great bowl holder which comes with chrome insert but my own pottery one fits fine. Cleans easily and has handle area to pick it up off floor.,5
"Ok, so this did reduce the amount of litter kicked out of it, but it has a very silly design flaw. The bottom of it is not flat, but has a lowered rectangle around the edges. This made it more difficult to scoop because my cat's business would get stuck at this extra edge it created. I returned to her regular flat bottomed litter box until I can come up with something better.",2
"This may be a good product. I can only put it in my cats food, they wouldn't drink water that I had put it in though. The pro to using the FortiFlora by purina is they like the taste. I wish this would have worked in the water.",3
"If i was using this as a filter by itself, 3 stars. But as a sponge attachment of a hang on back filter, 5 stars. Videos up soon. YouTube- ReefingWithReefers",5
The taste is ok (My dog thinks) but I definitely see a difference in my dog. She digests it really well and the stool is very healthy looking since she started eating this (sorry about gross details lol),5
Great treats! Pups love them.,5
"It turns out, if you have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PetSafe-Drinkwell-Platinum-Dog-and-Cat-Water-Fountain-168-oz/dp/B000L3XYZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PetSafe Drinkwell Platinum Dog and Cat Water Fountain, 168 oz.</a>&nbsp;and  a cat chased another cat across it and knocked it slightly askew, it will drain out.  All over the floor.  Well, we have three of these fountains, so now we have three of these mats, and they fit PERFECTLY!!  There is a bit of a lip, so if water drains out, it might give you an extra couple of minutes to become aware of what's going on.

The cats don't seem to care.  They don't have to stretch to reach the bowl or the stream of water.  They also haven't knocked the fountain so the cord ended up under the edge, so I can't guarantee that the water won't still slosh out, but since the lip is 1"" high, it should hold a lot of water.",5
Cuteness love it,4
Such a nice concept with the warm pad in the bottom . Nicely made. It did take my kitty awhile to realize that she could not make it fold up like the cubes. Made me laugh to watch her try.,5
My dog loves It. Also received quickly,5
These are great pads for my yorkie!  Since my bathroom has a turquoise decor....they look good too!!!  The bottom liner is a soft turquoise!,5
My Labrador loves these. They bounce high and are quite durable. Not texted at all.  The different colors are great so they don't get confused with other dogs' toys at the park.,5
"I found this litter on clearance at major pet retailer and decided to give it a try. To note, I also bought a clean, never used litter pan. That's important because as scratches come into the plastic, feces and urine will tend to stick more to the bottom, increasing your odor factor. That said, I love this litter! I went down to being a single cat household, and that's a factor is overall odor control too, but this clumps really well for both urine and feces, and does a pretty fair job of keeping the ammonia levels out of the air. You still smell the poo some, but that's more or less to be expected. If you are diligent in scooping, the box remains pretty much odor free. I have had the plastic handle bag size for over a month and there's still litter left to use. If you have more than one cat however, your mileage may vary. I would love to buy this again, but it is I think kind of pricey. I guess not when you weigh the stink factor and that it seems to last quite a long time over cheaper brands that have me emptying the entire box to get rid of the smell.",4
As described! Very strong and safe,5
Thanks!,5
"Very strong. I have a heavy chewer & strong jawed dog. The red Kong is good, this is even better!!!",5
"I have cats that have suddenly refused to eat any dry cat food, they are older cats and seem to like this, at least they are eating it!",5
Our pug is tickled with this toy and loves making it laugh.,5
"Despite having different can size options, it seems to miss the pretty standard size can we use. We can kind of jam it on, but the lid we had before (different brand- can't remember which) was much better.",2
Good Quality!,5
I didn't find this to be any better than regular hydrocortisone that can be purchased over the counter.,3
"My German Shepherds love this treat!  For some reason it's more appealing to them than the straight bully stick.  I don't know why the circular bully puzzle is better, but they love it!",5
Just what I needed!,5
awesome price and bags are pretty good quality as well...I love the color!,5
"After leaving this on the living room floor for two weeks my cat FINALLY decided to use it and now she uses it quiet frequenly.  (could have something to do with the fact I had to shove her in her cat carrier for a vet appointment and the groomers over the past couple of weeks)

The pillow it comes with is super soft and thick and frankly it does look really cozy.  I think my next bed I get for myself will be of similar design.",4
"Wow ---- these are so loved by our dogs!!  I'm giving these 5 stars, but really they deserve double that.  Our dogs go WILD for these.

These are REAL chicken.  They smell good, they look good.  I almost tasted them, they look and smell so good.  But, I didn't.  I trusted what my dogs said about these.  They love, love, love them.  I think they love them just as must as freshly roasted chicken from the oven.

They are jerky, so they are hard and chewy.  I don't worry about the larger dog, he can chew and eat anything.  But, for the little one, I tear up the bigger pieces.  I've even made a special treat and tore up and soaked some of these in very hot water.  I let it sit for a while and then give it to them.  They are so happy with these treats.

I hope I don't offend when I say this - but I call them the Chicken Crack.  Honestly, they go crazy for these treats.  Like no other treats before.",5
I didn't want to use the choker method to leash train my puppies.  This was great.  Doesn't choke them and yet I had control.,5
Only 2 of our 4 dogs would use these.,3
My dog loves these treats and its a great deal. I always buy these for her and it is way cheaper online then in stores. These are great training and reward treats.,5
"Kind of expensive, but nice to have. Very convenient.",4
Just okay. Kind of pricey for not so much product,3
"There's not a lot to say about this product. They're peanuts...and that's it! But they're good quality and fresh (as far as I can tell), and they're shelled as per their description. I've never found any bits of shells or anything aside from peanuts in the bags. The wild birds, including peacocks, love them.",5
"My sister originally bought this toy at a local pet store for her 6 month old French bulldog puppy, my Shepherd mix saw it and took it over so I came on to faithful Amazon to buy another to replace the one my pup stole. I was pleased to find not only the frog I was looking for but others of the same type but different animals(I just wish they had been listen by product name not a random number so I could have found them easier). So far both the original frog and the additional pig I bought are holding up to the play and abuse of two French bulldog puppies and my 60lb Shepherd/Belgian Mal. Mix! The squeakers are still going strong and the addiction of thebsuddle crackle noise seems to be a crowd pleaser with the pups! I bought a few of each animal to replace the toys as they were shredded but so far the spares haven't been needed! I would highly recommend this toy, it has a fun squeak, stands up to dog on dog tugging, great for tossing, and doesnt have stuffing so even if your dog manages to get a hole in it there won't be a mess to clean up!",5
Works perfect just what I was looking for.,5
Exactly like the pic,5
Great harness.  We have been using this brand for three years.  Spots clean up easy in the sink with hand soap. Love the pink!,5
"I really like this product! I thought what do I need this for, I use my grocery bags and run it out the door. Well during those cold months and rainy days... this is super convenient when you don't want to go outside. It really does hold in the odor! If it also better then having the grocery bag sit open for 5 minutes letting the smell fill the room while I finish cleaning the boxes. Now for the cons... why I only give it 4 stars. The hole where you drop the ""droppings"" in, is too small. I have a medium size scooper and I seem to get litter falling everywhere even when I'm being careful. I have 4 adult cats so I am not scooping tiny kitten poops. So I have litter build up on the plastic that angles down. Second con and the main reason I give it 4 stars is the price of refills! Wtf?! Your charging what for plastic bag refills?! I bought this a couple weeks ago so I should have done my research on the refills... but I was blinded by the cheap price of the container itself. Now the bags are pretty heavy duty... they held up when I filled the container and ripped out the very heavy bag, but it's still a plastic bag.",4
"My cats love this wand toy, even the one that hardly ever plays with any kind of cat toy.",5
"This is the only toy my dog hasn't destroyed yet! She's had it for weeks and has just barely broken into the outside seal so there's a bit of the black fabric fraying. This has held up so well with daily rough playing and games of tug o war! I have a 25lb dog that is the ultimate destroyer of toys, the Tuffy ring has been a formidable match for her strong jaw!",5
"I love the way the lid on this spins shut like the door to Cerebro. It really is a vault. This is a high-quality, durable container that completely seals in the food and keeps ants and dogs out. I did find that it holds slightly less than advertised for the brand that we purchase. It nearly holds a 30lb bag of our dog food, which is slightly larger kibble-wise and has chunks of dried meat in it. No biggie because we already keep some extra in a smaller container for travel or emergencies.",4
Splits open easily,2
Perfect for our communication of who fed the dog!,5
"Good, I like it.",4
"My puppy is a very picky eater, but these freeze dried patties break up nicely to use as training treats.  My dog loves them so I love them.",5
Been using this for several years and it seems to help keep my dogs clean. I also brush his teeth with a power toothbrush and paste. No troublesome side effects so far.,4
"I purchased this cooling collar with the intentions of using it on my Bernese Mountain Dog who just turned a year old.  I know she is very susceptible to the heat with her 4 of black hair.  It hasn't been very warm so I haven't really had a chance to use it in the heat to see if it actually helps cool her down.  However, I can speak to the physical aspects of the cooling collar for now.

I ordered the Large/X-Large and am very happy with the size.  It fits my girl perfectly, and it looks like it would stretch well to accommodate a larger dog than her.  The material is a very lightweight, stretchy fabric.  The cooling collar kind of feels like a lighter version of the material that is used for gym clothes.

The instructions on the box say to wet the cooling collar with cool water and place on the dog.  The fabric stays moist and cool.  I placed the damp cooling collar in a Ziploc bag and decided to keep it in the fridge.  So far its working great and I haven't noticed any musty/moldy smell from the collar being constantly wet.

I was a little worried that my dog would try to take the cooling collar off, and she did if it was pulled up over her ears.  However, if the collar is more around her neck and behind her ears, shes quite happy to leave it in place.  I love that theres a little spot for a collar D-ring to fit through so this can be worn while the dog is being walked.  I walk my dogs 4 miles or so almost every day so this is a huge benefit for us and I know it will help keep my girl cool on our walks this summer.

Great product, love the idea, and Im confident it will help keep my dog comfortable in our summer heat

This product was received either at no or low cost in exchange for my honest review. No compensation was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and are unbiased.",5
"Works well, I use two for my system just to make sure I get a stable and accurate temp reading. This is the better brand, used to order a different brand and turned out to be defective and not working properly.
I guess AODE brand sort their products to make sure they are working properly, I highly recommend this brand",5
Does the job! This beats paying $15 for pet shop to do it.,5
"This has been a great portable water dish for my dog. One thing to note, 3-cup is one three cup bowl not three bowls....not sure why I was so confused about that.",4
works,5
I wish they had this when we had the baby.  These are much thicker than the Diaper Genie.  It contains the smell much better.  The scoop that comes with it is the same size as the opening.  Perfect!  I highly recommend the Litter Genie.,5
very nice!,5
"Dimensions seemed fine online, but when it came in the mail, the cave is very small.

Cave is very solid in construction, but the biggest downfall is that it will only house a baby/juvenile Leopard Gecko; it is way too small for my adult.

Any reptile/animal smaller than 5"" in length will be fine.  Anything larger might have problems.",3
"This product says it is for transporting up to a 22 pound animal.  I would not put more than a 5 pound dog in it.  It has no support on either side so it collapses in upon itself.  So the animal has no room to move, has sides collapsing at it and no protection from anything that might bump it.  Other carriers I have had provide a metal support inside to hold the carrier in place, making it secure.
 It does have several pockets.  It might be good for transporting your swimming stuff because air can get in to dry it off.",2
I had a Hoover. This bowl has slowed his eating down considerably. My only complaint is that the bottom doesn't seem to be non-skid so my poor dog is chasing it all over the kitchen. I will probably figure out a way to make it non skid.,4
Excellent product but too expensive.,5
"We have a problem with our cats marking. All. over. the. house. After bringing them to the vet to make sure there wasn't a physical issue, we decided to try this. At first  it seemed to help, but lately they're back to bad habits. Kind of feel this was a waste of money for us.",2
This is super cute.  I bought a small for my 12.6 lb Silky terrier and it fit but was way to tight around her chest and fit more like a shirt.  The size chart showed she should wear a small on her measurements but there is no give or much stretch.  I will be ordering a medium for her.  Great quality and very cute dress!  I ordered 3 others from this company that I have to exchange as well.  All top notch.  I will continue to order from fitwarm.,5
"All 3 of my dogs  25-lbs beagle, 50-lbs golden retriever and 90-lbs lab  LOVE these little ducks! I buy them so many different kinds of toys, but this is their favorite. Its so cute.",5
I bought one of these on clearance at Target for around $3. I'm glad I didn't pay very much for it. Our dog liked it more than the cat did which was very amusing but it broke after about 15 minutes. We tried replacing the batteries but it still doesn't work.,2
"Great bags, they do what they're supposed to and this purchase will probably last me the better part of a year.  I'd rather buy these in bulk for a decent price than to have to pick up doggie clean-up bags once a month or so.",5
"My little boxer puppy loves Nylabones and this one is her favorite.  She is six months old and still cutting her back teeth, this helps.",5
My cat loves this food! This is the only brand he'll eat!,5
"I love this leash  it's very sturdy without being heavy and the handle is very comfortable and soft. I use it while running my dog with my bike, twice a day for about an hour each time. He drools quite a bit and I have had to wash the leash. It dries quickly and cleans beautifully. I am very happy with this purchase.",5
"Trustworthy product, Trustworthy seller!",4
"My picky dog loves it, but his bowel movements haven't been that firm even after slowly transitioning him over two weeks to Wellness. He seems healthy and happy though.",4
EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,5
My senior little dog loves these,5
"Bunny goes potty in his litter pan, no problems! Super easy to clean. Sturdy enough that you don't need to hook it on the cage. I was very surprised how fast he learned to use this pan.",5
"I have a five gallon tank with three African dwarf frogs and one tiger snail. I bought frozen blood worms when I purchased them and they never ate the bloodworms. Waste of money! I don't know if maybe they weren't raised on raw foods or they just couldn't find them in the tank, but they didn't eat them. They love these pellets though. As soon as they drop in thit water they all come out of hiding. I've even seen the snail eating the them before they could be considered leftovers.",5
somedays they like it,4
"Good but not puuurfect. Cat can easily back out of harness since not very secure around neck, however to be fair, I don't think there is any design that can prevent this. Also neck flaps a little too long - not good if your cat has a short neck.",4
Rabbit loved anything willow.,5
"I love these.  Ordered two -- then ordered 3 more once I saw how much my puppy loves them.  I have 3 outside on my patio (cement), one in my house, and one in the office.  She loves to play in the grass, and will use like a litter box (much better than the litter box I had before).  I highly recommend for a new puppy who is begin housebroken.",5
"Plain and simple they are air stones. Pump the air to them and they work, and they work well. Solid and good disbursement.",4
"The black collar works fine. The orange collar works from five feet away or closer, however is completely dysfunctional at anything further than five feet away. I hate the fact that you have to pair the units every time you charge them. Don't waste your money.",1
I use this in conjunction with Zymox Enzymatic Ear Solution with Hydrocortisone and it works wonderfully with my dog that has chronic ear infections. No more vet trips and expensive antibiotics. Weekly application of both products and I have a happy dog!! Can't recommend these products enough,5
"Nice size crate , easy set-up",4
Worked great.  Smells wonderful (I don't thing the dog cares about that part).  Went on smoothly.,5
"Works great, dog loves it",5
"my dogs didn't love this... ended up dumping in the kibble bucket and mixing up, but still have to add something to their food.  Wouldn't buy this again.",3
I use it to fill a Kong toy and then put in the freezer,5
I'm happy with Tidy Cats litter. I buy the type with Glade air freshener in it.,5
Avoderm  is great for my dogs skin dander and coat.,5
"This cage has been wonderful. We get compliments wherever we go. Our eclectus is happy and feels secure in it.  My only 3 suggestions for improvements.... 1) the locking mechanism is a bit wonky and I worry over time it will wear out and not be as secure 2) the perch was cheap, we replaced it the first time we took the bird out because his nails still slid off and 3) coop cups don't fit effectively for a day trip.  But, I love the cage.",4
Our dog loves his Kong toys. They are the best made pet toys I have bought and last a long time. The quality can not be beat. Kong has it down to a science. Even through all his tug-a-war games they have all lasted.,5
We are so happy that they make Lamp products! We found out that chicken and other poultry food upset our dog's digestive system. Switching him over from chicken to lamb was very easy.,5
"My dog gets loose stool whenever I give him one full treat. He's 16 lbs, so I'm supposed to give him just half of one treat per day, but I don't think he should get loose poop from eating the other half. The good thing is that I cut up all the treats in half, so I have enough to last me a very looong time since I can only give him one-half per day. But I will likely not order these again.",3
"These pet bowls are more durable, and easier to extend and collapse, for either shallow or deep bowl use.  After buying a competitor's travel bowl and having it come apart within a week; I wish I had gone with a Buster Bowl to beginning with.",5
Works as stated,5
"My fish love it as a nice treat, plus the babies have something to eat too",5
"It seems to be working! It is so difficult to find anything that works perfectly but this works very well. I like that I can use my broom vacuum to vacuum up those wayward litter pellets. I had some small rugs down but they were impossible to vacuum - could only shake them out - and that tended to scatter the litter other than where it was supposed to go.

It has a fairly thin 'pile' and although not heavy it is stiff enough to lay flat - no buckling or shifting. It has a subdued attractive 'swirl' design on it.

I like that it is big enough that a section of it fits under my Cat Genie litter box. If one of the cats chooses to tear out of the litter box for the fun of it, it stays put. Before such antics by the cats would scatter litter and the mats. This stays down and flat so it is there to 'catch' most of the litter off the cat's paws as she jumps out. I don't have to constantly re-adjust or arrange it as the other mats required.

I would definitely recommend it!",5
My dog loved these and it took a few minutes to chew up.  Nice treat.,5
as described,5
The dogs seems to like it a lot.  Very durable.  Well made.,5
"This was fun for my puppy, though as she has lost interest in kibble, the interest in the toy has waned.

I would imagine it would be great to slow down a food driven dog who eats too quickly.",4
"If you have a cat you know they are insane and that if it works for mine it means nothing for you hehe

my 12lb cats that are picky about how they are brushed like this more that a few other models I have tried (both mitten and fingered mitts).

while the furminator does the best job if your cat says ""no thanks""...what can you do but look for another solution?",5
"This was our second box ordered as we really like the first time. Among 1,000 bags we have used from the first box, there are amazingly ZERO defective bags!  We really like them. Thanks",5
"It's been such a helpful thing and is fave of my 10 mo kitten. We tired it to Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy and it's a perfect match. It's light, my kitten goes crazy and I'll be buying a new one soon because it's almost ripped apart.
Had to throw away cat nip - it didn't work and I think it's better for cats not to sniff any suspicious grass.
Please, buy together with Cat dancer. It's an awesome entertainment for your cat and yourself.
PS: The little squirrel is of a size of a mouse and actually looks like a real red haired mouse.
Could have played with it myself, if I were a cat.",5
"I just got a male kitty from a local shelter, He is 10 months old and polydactyl, I basically put this in my bedroom (not knowing if/when he would scratch). I simply emulated scratching and he was immediately intrigued and followed my lead. It's too early to know if he will limit his scratching to this (I have caught him on other things), but it's a great start. I gave it a 4 because there is a strong chemical smell that has not abated as of yet (3 days). Price was great and shipping flawless w Prime. I love Amazon!",4
So strange - my cat hated it also.. Big Frank loves everything and we would walk away from this. No idea why.,3
"Had this about 3 months and it has worked well to circulate the water at the surface of my tank, but it does seem to catch a lot of crap in it that I can not see in the tank.",4
This is always the first thing they eat,5
dogs tip them over easily.,2
"I gave my puppy some of this food in the evening and after a few hours, he had really bad diaherra. Eventually he throw up and refused to touch the food afterwards.",1
"Great food for the dogs. No gas, good output. They hoover it up.",5
Easiest system ever. Don't ever go back to buying pre-made bags.,5
"I've ordered three of these dresses one came medium and it fit, the second one came xxl and it was too big the last one was too small I'm going to try to put them together and get one dress because it's so pretty",5
I love this product and your birds will too. All my birds are happy.,5
"Great little product, my chinchilla started using this as his potty for tinkles right away.",5
My dog loves this when mixed with his dry dog food,5
"4 cats, 2 are high and 1 has the munchies and one walked away :-)

For the 1 who thought it was ok and the 1 who could care less, I mixed a smidgen  with their fav catnip and they went crazy.

The 2 that love it actually fight a lot,  once I gave each their own little bag of this awesome nip, they played together!  While rolling and rubbing on it.

Cat approval!",5
Do not buy another tennis ball again! These balls last. My dog is a chewer and has not destroyed a ball since we bought them 8 months ago. They are great for playing fetch and they wash easily.,5
"I live in an apartment in Los Angeles. I don't have a yard with a hose and space to leave a litter box out to dry in the sunlight, and I will NEVER scrub a filthy cat toilet out inside my bathtub. Solution? THESE BABIES. I have 1 cat and I change the box every 3 months. I'm happy to pay less than $20/year to never have to scrub a litter box! Just throw this box in the dumpster when it starts to look/smell icky, and start fresh. So easy. They're extremely thick, sturdy and don't leak!",5
needs cover,4
Once again- these are the best quality treats out there. My frenchie goes CRAZY for them and I mean he will just sit and stare up at them wherever they are and beg for more... I wouldn't feed my dog anything else.,5
"The product is very well made for dogs. My dog loves it, keeps him interested all the time and its three squirrels plus the stump.",5
Good,5
perfect,5
Have yet to have a problem with aqueon.  Aqueon makes good tank equipment that is well regulated and is accurate with keeping temperature.,5
"It's cute and cats like it, but the feathers come off very easily. It's very cute and fun for the cats.",3
"I just got a tiny little dog, and need the teenie treats for her.",5
"I love the idea of this. but our puppy knocked it over within minutes of it being in her kennel. They need to figure out a way for this to be more secure, or find a different option for an energetic puppy. Not returning, in case she can work with it when she is older, but not worth what I spent for it.",2
"Has lasted me 2 weeks so far, the longest lasting toy I have every bought my pup. This was the best $6 I have ever spent!",5
"Overall its a good dog food with quality ingredients but not for picky eaters. The food doesnt have a nice smell like other brands.  Because of this, it might be lacking flavor too. One of my dogs like it but the other hates it",4
I never buy these filters anywhere else; Amazon offers the best deal for them. There isn't much to say about them except that they do exactly what they're supposed to do.,5
Love these for my dog,5
My 9 year old has been on Glycoflex 3 since she was about 2.  Absolutely loves them (though to me they kind of stink).  Good quality zipper closure keeps them fresh & 'smell free' between feedings.  I add 2 to her breakfast each morning; she eats them 1st.  If I tease her & put her breakfast down without them she waits until I add them.  Don't run out if you start your dog on them.  She's a mix breed but both breeds prone to joint problems - she's doing great.  Hoping part of that is due to her supplements.,5
works  very well,5
Cats love this. Especially at 5am!,5
"My cat's will only eat the Classic texture when they are starving. All three of them prefer the Grilled texture better. However, I can only feed the seafood variety as the beef flavor causes my cats to be sick and they will only eat the turkey and chicken if forced to.",1
"My longhair Maine Coon mix has always despised brushes. Like her owner she has extremely sensitive skin, so any sort of pulling or brushing is uncomfortable if not downright painful for her. I had been using a Furminator, but since I was worried about pulling out all her fur I looked at the ZoomGroom.

Now, keep in mind that this cat will and has bitten me in the past for rubbing her fur the wrong way, literally. But using the ZoomGroom as directed, she purrs, comes back for more, and seems to ask me to get certain spots. It is extremely gentle on her coat and skin. As a bonus, it doesn't seem to 'catch' or pull on her long hair.

After using it for a week or two I'm seeing a dramatic decrease in the number of little hair clumps left around my apartment, and her coat is slowly but surely getting smoother and softer. One caution I do have is that her fur can feel 'tangled' if I'm not careful and brush it back to normalcy. All in all this is a great product, so don't hesitate!",5
Great gift for a friend who has lost he best buddy.,5
"Honestly, everyone with a cat should buy this. Both my cats love it, & it's so cheap! They liked it so much that I bought a second one.",5
"Glad I bought these, I keep the cat and dog treats on my desk, and these look great. The large size hold a 2 lb bag of mini dog treats, and small size holds a couple bags of cat treats. Not air-tight - I leave the bags sealed and just store them inside the containers.",4
"Cockatiels love it, but it gets destroyed quickly.  We are on the second one, and I will take a short break from buying them.",5
Very useful since my two yorkie always make a mess when they eat.,3
It imparts a cloudy haze to the tank. I suspect these are ammonia loving bacteria. 3 weeks into tank cycling and only had 2 feeder goldfish die on me. Going to try cycling the tank using an ammonia solid next time without feeder fish.,4
"Cute collar, I got it for a black cat, so the white leather was a plus.
I don't know what type of powder coat was used but the kitty has been wearing it for 5 days and the color is already rubbing off of the spikes, so I am not sure how much longer the coloring will last. I thought powder coating was a lot harder to rub off or didn't rub off at all. The cat is indoor only.",3
My major chewer can demolish this!  My other two are not interested in this at all.  Just me...might work great for others!  All dogs have their own personal traits and interests.,1
Great for keeping wire down from winter thaw,5
My 11 month old - 100lb Great Pyrenees & Yellow Lab puppy (who will eat anything) was putting off eating his Hill's Science Diet food for hours. Figured that he needed a 'change' after 11 months & got him this EUKANUBA Puppy - Large Breed and he freakin loved it.,4
My cats went absolutely crazy for these!  Will definitely purchase more in the future.,5
I have two cats under one year of age. They love this thing. They spin it around on their own. They pounce on it and chase it. I've had it for a month now and they are still loving it. It's a constant source of entertainment for them.,5
"I have small dogs, so this kibble is a little larger than what they like. They seem to not care for the taste, as much, either. I will try another flavor",3
Excellent quality dry food. I wish there would be more dry meat in it.,5
Occupied my dog for quite some time!!,5
Liver support for my senior beagle.  Love that it's not a prescription!,5
Really great value and good quality.  Does it what it is designed to do -- keeps the dog in the back seat and the back seat clean from mud and crud.,5
We use this in the house ALL THE TIME to keep peace between three cats.,5
My dog loves these treats !,5
"It's easy for Betta fish to contract bacteria.  By removing the nitrate, my bettas are surviving happily.  The stuff smells adverse & takes a while to see the result, but it works.",5
Love this. But it runs Big.. I got a small and it won't fit my little girl till maybe next year. So I think I would order a smaller size.,5
Love this product because it actually works on my S***zu.  The scent is nice without being overwhelming.,5
This is a fantastic dog mat. It stays in place. It keeps a good amount of the hair in the hammock (our dog sheds a ton). I like that you can simply hook all the straps to the back seat when people need to ride in the back seat (as opposed to having to take off the whole hammock). We have had this over one year now and really like it. I would give it 5 stars if all the hair were kept in the hammock (some still manages to find its way to our floor meaning cleaning is still necessary but at much less frequent intervals). The quality is excellent.,4
"These are nice, price is great compared to the local stores, but they are weird. They expel...stuff sometime and I don't understand. The fish seems to like them, so no harm no fowl.",4
"I got these because I wanted to only give my dog natural treats/chews, he likes it but doesn't love it so I will continue my search of finding the perfect natural chew. My dog isn't picky so he'll eat anything, but if he loves something, he will cry and beg for more and will also finish it in a flash. With these, he only ate it half way and didn't touch it again until the next day.",4
"BUYER BEWARE!!!

Now, as to the terrible experience I had with this seller...

I ordered this cage from them because I needed a replacement cage for my bird that was chrome but did NOT have decorative wire scrolling around the top.  I have had an incident where my bird had his foot caught in between the scrolling wire and the cage bars.  It was a good thing I was there when it happened so that I could help him get it out.  The picture on the page and the description say nothing about the decorative scrolling, so I thought that this would be the best replacement cage.

When it arrived I was shocked when I opened the box and found it was ... you guessed it ... the exact same cage I already have with the decorative wire.  So I contacted the seller and explained the situation.  I was told because the cage arrived undamaged it could be returned, but I would have to pay for the shipping of the cage back to the seller and the refund I received would only be for the cost of the cage and not the initial shipping charge.  So, if I sent it back I would be out roughly $50.

I kept trying to explain that I felt that the description and photo was misleading and that the return was through no fault of my own.  I would NEVER have ordered this cage had I known it had the decorative scrolling wire.  The final offer from the seller was that he would pay for the shipping for the return, but the refund would only be for the price of the cage.  The initial shipping would still be my loss.  But, he offered to give me 15% off a new purchase.  Not gonna happen!

I figured if I was going to lose out on the shipping I might as well save myself the hassle, assemble the cage and sell it on Craigslist.  What a nightmare!

This product is really cheaply made.  It doesn't even go together properly.  There are gaps everywhere! Especially where the dome top connects to the cage body.  The safety catch for the pan and the grate came installed on the wrong side of the cage front.  There is no way to correct that because that piece is assembled at the factory (in China of course)and most of the other pieces don't fit well together.  The assembly process leaves much to be desired as well because there are absolutely NO instructions.  Not even a picture to follow.

So now I am out the entire purchase and shipping!  I can't sell this terrible excuse for a good cage.  I will NEVER do business with this seller again.  I will NEVER recommend this seller and I hope that if you're reading this review you understand that if you purchase this cage you're getting junk!",1
bought this for a couple papillons in a hurry we were desperate as we needed it for an event.  We used it once and will probably just throw it in the box with the rest of the things that are to big for our dogs but that I will loan out to one of my 4-H kids if needed.  It is really nicely made.  No fault of the product just fault of the buyer.  :)  I had one custom made with the clips that go on purses so they are pretty tiny.,3
Used an entire bag for my 10G. 6 months later and my plants still appear happy. It looks natural and very nice for aquascaping.,5
"Nice product, just not suitable for my kitties (they have acne issues with plastic).",4
"These bully sticks are nice and thick and long-lasting! They are not completely odorless, but not as stinky as some. The dog loves them. They don't splinter, and they provide hours of chewing pleasure for our goldendoodle. Price was a good deal. I will buy these again and highly recommend them!",5
"I bought this for a cat who had his leg amputated. It worked, he could get in and out easily. It is messy though. No pan that has a ramp is going to keep the litter is as well as a covered pan. That isn't their fault though.",3
"My Australian Cattle dog is obsessed with tennis balls and now these are her favorite.  Not only is it the same material and size as a tennis ball, but it squeaks making her addicted to it.  I don't find the squeaking annoying. This is now her favorite balls compared to racket balls, tennis balls, and ChuckIt balls.",5
"I wanted something other than flake to put in my auto-feeder.  These are nice because they are small enough to work with the eheim auto feeder without having to open the flap too far.  Other granules were too big and too much flake came out.  I use this mixed with crushed flake and as a treat.  The fish seem to like it too.  They will float for a bit, but sink eventually.  Works for my top, middle, and bottom feeders.",5
My cats fought like crazy when I tried to put them in a front loading cat carrier.  It's so easy to put them in this top loading carrier and let them out the front door.  Seems sturdy and lots of open areas for them to look out.,5
"My dog and foster dogs have done well on this food. It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Amazon's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Amazon prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal!
Amazon shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were  not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Amazon- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that amazon offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered.",5
"This item is made out of the same durable rubber, but it is really thin. I understand the idea is that it can fly, but with 3 of my dogs they will start chewing on it before I even get the chance to take it away. When I first saw this item on Amazon I thought it would be thick like some of the other toys. When this one is chewed up, I will not buy another one of these. I need toys that are extremely difficult to chew up no matter what shape it is in.",3
"We've had the plastic part of this for a year or so now.  Our cats go through the cardboard center in a couple of months (we let them get to the point where they've completely torn it out), but fortunately it's easy to replace!",5
Works well as long as my bulldog doesn't get ahead of me when walking or it will slide back to his rear end. As long as I'm keeping r tension on the handles or pulling a bit forward it works great for helping my 9 year old bulldog walk after knee surgery on his back leg. It would be better if the handles were adjustable in length. As is when I need then shorter I just bunch the handles in my hand. Overall it works for helping to carry him using this and his harness to hold himhim and for helping him walk with assistance.,5
"good product but too expensive, filters are expensive too",4
"These noisy crinkly balls are ok. I have 4 cats and they occasionally play with them. These toys seem well made. There's nothing wrong with the toys, it's just my cats are picky and  prefer the bouncy spongy balls over the crinkly ones.",3
Puppia makes the best harness for my Italian Greyhound.,5
"I just got this last Friday and used it for the first time that evening.  It came pre-charged and ready to go.  Very easy to use - especially when this is the first time I've ever cut my dog's hair.  He's an 11 lbs Maltese mix with long and matted hair because he doesn't like to be brushed.  Amazingly, he was more comfortable with the clipper than the brush.

The instruction booklet that comes with the clipper is very helpful and includes tips and tricks for each part of the body as well as different coat type on the dog.  I wanted to trim his hair very short because it's getting very warm out.  I used #3 first because of his long hair and it only took a few minutes to get a hang of the clipper.  Then I finished it off with #1.  On the badly matted part and on his face, I used the scissors that come with the kit to cut them out.

I'm very pleased with the purchase and my dog turned out looking just like he went to the groomer but costed a lot less.  One cut and the tool already pays for itself.",5
"These are cute, unique toys, but I was surprised to see how small they are, very disappointed in the size.",1
This essentially put a stop to my puppy's random unexplained bouts of diarrhea after less than a week's use. We use it 100% of the time now.,5
"I have two dachshunds and they go absolutely nuts for bully sticks. However, buying them at Petco was $$$$. I like that these have the subscribe and save option, too.",5
I just got this for my 8 month Doberman.  He really likes it and it is holding up really well.,5
I have 1 on these on each end of my tank and they keep the temp between 80 and 90 degrees. The price through Amazon is unbeatable. I was going to purchase one from the local pet store but they were asking almost the same price for these but on the smallest size.,5
great price fast shipping,5
"Dogs gobbled these right up.  Hard to say if they helped their bellies but I am going to continue to use a while longer.  They have sensative stomachs and this didn't make them worse, so thats a plus",4
"Horrible, 2 minutes and it was done.",1
"I purchased a red tag for my girl and a blue tag for my boy. We chose the large bone shape surrounded by Swarofski Crystals, as my pups are also large. They are SO beautiful! I thought I would like them but I, in fact, adore them! My pups are SO excited to proudly wear their new bling. I don't keep their collars on while they are in the house because they love to wrestle but they do wear them everyday to go for walks. The crystals remain in place. They do not seem to scratch or wear easily. These are the best tags I have ever purchased.",5
"Great sturdy feeding stand and the bowls are awesome, not just in color but they happen to be the perfect size for my cats food amount.",5
"A little hard for very young pups (less than 2 weeks) - will chafe soft skin. Worked well for older pups, but once they started to play, the velcro would come loose and get lint on it and fall off. Buy 2 sets if you are tracking your litter by color
so you can replace the ones that get linty.",4
TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PIECES OF CHICKEN ARE THE LARGER ONES IN THE MIX.....IF SO......NOT VERY MUCH.  ALSO MAKES MY DOG POOP MORE THAN OTHER FOODS.,3
"I, at first left an unfavorable review.  I received a link for a video to watch about the operation of the collar.  It helped a lot.  I wasn't using it properly.  I do like the collar since it is smaller than most and isn't as bulky.  After using it according to video, it seems to work better.  It isn't a real good collar but for the cost it works OK.  My dog isn't barking as much as she was.  I think this might work better for an inside pet rather than an outside one.  Mine is outside.  I would like if it had a remote as others I've reviewed had.

I received this item at little or no cost in exchange for my unbiased product review.",4
Both my cat and dog loves this treats.,5
One of the best things I bought for my new kitten.  He loves it.,5
"It says small/medium but it's pretty small, cuts through nails like nothing which is great! Will purchase the large set next so I can have both sizes!",4
My dogs love these!,5
"The fountain doesn't splash, but some cats do! Our Norwegian Forest Cat immediately began batting at the stream of water and attempting to bite the stream of water. Not sure how much playing happens when he goes to drink water, but evidently some as there are often a few drops of water on the mat.",5
Great product!,5
"Super cute, but our sweet labradoodle had an ear off in a matter of minutes. Not as durable as other huggle hounds.",3
"My cats love this food. They love it so much that the second time I ordered a bag of this they started chewing through the side of it even though they had plenty of food in their dish. I recommend you keep this out of reach, but its some great stuff and contains a good amount of protein without the garbage filler.",5
Chose this because it provides warmth and is pretty easy to put on the dog. offers warth from the cold as it is lined and the outside provedes protection from precipitation. Bought it as a holiday gift for mour daughter's new puppy and she Loved it. she has a coat that has a similar coat so they can be twins.,5
"My cats may not like this food as much as the Fancy Feast Broths, but obviously the price difference is enormous so I try to switch out as much as I can.

The reason I went to prefer Friskies over 9 Lives (for wet food) is because these cans clean out so easy!  I love these updated cans.  Makes recycling them so much easier.",5
"Nice vest but I think it runs a little small. Measured the widest part of her chest, and she was barely 26 inches so it looked like either the medium or the large would fit. Went with the medium, as she's kind of lanky and I didn't want the large to overwhelm her.

Unfortunately, the medium was way too tight -- could barely get it on at fullest extension! Plus, it even looked small across her shoulders. She reminded me of that old Chris Farley skit ""Fat guy in a little coat."" Oh dear....

The vest is nice, though!

My one small issue (other than sizing) is that there should also be velcro on the OUTSIDE of the strap that fastens across the dog's chest, so you can use both ""In Training"" patches. The way it is now, the strap comes over from the left, across the dog's front, and attaches to the strip of velcro on the right side of the harness -- so there's no where to stick the patch there. If I were to keep this harness (or buy a replacement), I would need to sew velcro to the outside of that strap if I wanted both sides to say ""In Training.""

Also, please note: this seller does NOT pay for shipping if you need to exchange the harness for a bigger/smaller size, so take care when measuring and size up, not down. Hope this helps!",3
"Good shampoo. Did not have to se a lot to get a good lather. I don't know if it helped much with fleas, but honestly I did not get it for fleas. I mostly just wanted a nice do shampoo that was reasonably priced, smelled good, and got my dog clean. I got exactly what I wanted so I am a happy camper!",5
"We had a ""medium"" hair length cat who would have problems with hair-balls. He would eagerly eat this, and when we remembered to give it to him a couple times a week in the shedding period, he never had a problem!",4
This food was infested with some kind of worm (that then hatches and is some kind of flying bug). We have an infestation now of these bugs.,1
When used properly this gives the water true clarity like no other product.,5
"Great light! It's so bright, makes my tank look great.",5
"My puppy loved this a little too much. I ordered this one after buying the same one at a store. The first lasted 2-3 months until she tore a hole in its neck. I tossed that one when this one arrived... and within an hour she had torn off 3 limbs. In less than 24 hours it was in 6 pieces. Some stronger/reinforced stitching would be great. Sadly, she loves it but I won't buy it again.",3
I've given up on using this  as a training tool for my female Cockatiel (she responds better to my vocal praise) but it does what it is supposed to. You press it and it clicks. :),5
great product  great price,5
"These run large.  I have tried several no pull harnesses and cannot seem to get the correct fit for my barrel chested mastiffs.  I ordered the XL as that is what they take in the gentleleader (which is ok, but doesnt fit my corso girl correctly and is uncomfortable due to that, which led me to the sense-ation).  This is a soft strong fabric, with slides to keep the adjustments in place.  I LOVE that it is not a martingale in the front clip (as opposed the GL).  It is unfortunately way to big for my mastiff/pit mix and fits my corso girl but not as snug as it is supposed to be.  I recommend this harness, but buy a size smaller than you think.",4
"These collars are gorgeous and I have bought 5!! All different collars. Unfortunately I think they have caused all of my cats to lose their hair around their necks. All of them have really fine, thin hair on their necks now. It was really obvious on my senior cat and I ran her to the vet. I will be trying non-velvet collars for a while to see if their hair grows back. Otherwise gorgeous collars!",3
Best investment I've ever made!  She loves being groomed and I've cut down on alot of the cat hair left on furniture.,5
Great Product! My birds love it - definitely a great buy.,5
Cute and squeaky.  Perfect for a toy or small breed dog.  Definitely too small for bigger dogs (choking hazards).,5
"The expandable pouch is perfect. Well built, would highly recommend!!",5
"This is not for a medium or large dog, only little yappers.",1
Works great!,5
Helps our hard headed hound mix stay in our yard...only tested his boundaries once with this one and he felt it and doesn't chase deer etc. now.,4
"This harness was better than the gentle leader (which every time we put it on our dog, he snuggles the gentle leader on the ground). However, this harness lasted only 1 week for us as our dog bit the harness and broke. Having said that, this product worked as it says (our dog walked very well).",3
Two out of three Oscars will eat. Must make sure to scoop out the uneaten product ASAP; the Oscars that were eating it started suffering with some sort of skin and eye infection due to the bacteria formation around uneaten pellets. Third Oscar in different tank was eating another product and suffered no infection.,2
"I like this for my Doberman. I like the smaller twists for my Chihuahua. The like it the other way around - or they are like kids - they play a game of 'I'm gonna get yours, 'cause you got mine'! I find both chewing on both all day till there are little chewed chunks everywhere.",4
"This puppy formula just great needs, it even small like human food, you will enjoy it. My litter puppy growing up with canned food, and we are the fans of natural balance. Approved from dog mommy",5
"Would be nice if it came with the biostars, only comes with 5! Come on API that much money and u can't include everything???",4
"Installation was straight forward.  Viewing the video on the Ideal site was invaluable.

Watch out for electric wires.  I decided to cut a small hole inside the wall template outline, and feel for wires.  There were 2 alarm system wires, and an electric outlet wire.  I had to move the hole slightly to avoid these.

Excellent quality; very sturdy.",5

"I've tried them all Litter Robot, Scoop Free and toilet training my cats, but the Lucky Champ is being brought out again because it is better than all the more expensive automatic boxes in my opinion.  It is large, has high sides and the cover is not a solid piece of hard plastic but a material that lets light into the pan.  The cover is quite high too which is good, so many covered pans just aren't high enough.  I wish they had more cover choices but this pan is the best.",5
"This a gteat product. My dogs really like it, and their coats look great.",5
My beta is happy with the salt. He made bubbles. I did not know that salt made beta happy due to electrolytes.,5
These work great!,5
The product is well constructed and looks good on my dog.,5
It's nice to bring a filter back to life with parts.  easy to do.,5
"Contractor who installed this for me, said that it was the best doggie door he'd ever seen and was going to purchase one himself.  I used the extra wall kit, too.  I installed the door in a wall of the living room leading to the back yard; and you never even notice it.  Looks like it's always been there.",5
Good idea but the wee wee brand pads don't fit and when you fold them it won't clasp shut. Plus who wants to fold the pee pad all thetime. I also had the issue of my dog peeing on the edge of the pad when it was on the floor and I didn't think this would help. It's cute and discreet tho!,2
"We have always ordered Milk Bone products for our dogs, but lately we can get them cheaper on Amazon than we can in the local stores. We have now ordered treats and toys from Amazon so much that when the UPS man pulls up in front of the house, all three of our dogs begin barking and dancing around like kids on Christmas morning. Great value, great product, and most importantly happy dogs.",5
I use this daily to make my dogs more comfortable,5
"I haven't found a set of ID collars that work any better than these simple little velcro ones.  I like they give you a lot of them so you can pick out the cutest colors.

When the pups are very young, you have to check the collars at least twice a day to make sure they don't get a leg up through them.  As they get older, I make sure to check every few days to adjust for size (they grow so fast!).

Pleased with these, and the fact I can get them so inexpensively.

"They don't have a loud whistle, but my dogs love them",5
"Nice collar. Although from the picture showing the two attachment rings I thought it would kind of act like a choker, it does not.",4
"we feed all out cats, natures variety products so your safe getting them all, Instinct (dry, canned, or raw) or the canned homestyle.  we have not tried the instinct boost so couldn't verify that one but the cats love them and are recommended by vets and the upperscale pet stores",5
"This is a great post for cats. I rubbed a little catnip on it to get them started, but one of my two cats took to it right away. My other still prefers the cardboard panels for scratching, but for some cats this is the best solution.",5
"I have at least 10 ""Tuffy"" toys and they are all sizes and shapes, with some have squeekers.  I have 5 dogs, 3 labs and 2 misc. mixed breeds.  These dog toys are so great, the only thing my dogs have been able to do is unravel a small area, which did not affect the toy as they are repeatedly reinforced. Every other toy I have purchased and wasted money on, my dogs have destroyed.  These are expensive, but are well worth the money, because they last!  Remember, I have had 3 rescued (unstable) Labs!!!!
I would stick with the ones that have a lot of black stitching (octopus, alligator, boomerang) and not so much animals with filling lamb, bull,etc), as the material they use for the  first ones, the body and seams is very strong.  They also have a rating of strength, if you want to look that up, 1-10, 10 being the toughest.",5
"This is my puppy's favorite. It has lasted forever, and I already bought more backups for when it finally gets too chewed up.",5
Not sure if they worked. My dog died last Monday & I hadn't seen any improvement before then.,2
"This is great vest.  I live in an urban area that doesn't have many sidewalks or streetlights.  Also the woods where we like to walk has a ""deer management program"" -- read bow hunters.  So I wanted this vest for my dog for both street visibility and hunting visibility.  It does both very well.  In fact, I have discovered that I really like it when my dog is off leash in the woods as I can see him much better. The reflective parts -- the straps and the paw prints, show up great at night.  The vest is easy on and easy off.  It is waterproof and has held up well so far.  My dog has romped in the woods through brush and the vest has shown no signs or tears and it stays on!  I think it is lightweight -- we will see when the hot weather comes back.  My dog does not mind it at all.",5
I tried a store bought brand and thought it a waste of money. You get what you pay for applies here.,5
Great dog toy,5
"These aren't bad.  The metal is a but thin and the ""non-slip"" rubber is like a thin rubber gasket around the bottom of the bowl, but it mostly does the trick.  Luckily my boys are kind'a small, so they don't push them around too much, but I'm not sure I would get these if I had dogs over 40lbs...",3
Kitty LOVES his mice! They hold up nicely to tough play. Great quality,5
My cat loves these treats and the ingredients are good.,5
The holes are to big to put small treats in it.,3
Great price fast shipping,5
First  order was great 2nd great 3rd order seam to be old. Not as good as the first too orders.wood buy it again,4
Best litter I've found - have two cats and it seems to keep the smell covered for a long time,5
"works very well, and is easy to change",5
"We feed a feral colony at a trailer park and needed a way to keep the cats in food without our going there every day.  This item has worked great.  It holds an 16 to 18 lb bag of dry food which lasts our colony about 4 days.
It has held up well.  Even when it was taken apart by either the cats or some raccoons.  It can be put back together easily.  It is also easy to clean.  I'd recommend this for anyone. I might mention that we use it in an abandoned trailer, which helps keep it protected from ants and the elements.",5
Great value. Much cheaper than I find at the local grocery stores.,5
"I wish BOTH of my dogs loved these, but only one does. I've read that these are a good low cal treat, but as only one of my dogs likes them, I can't order them again.  If you do not have picky eaters, these are a good chew that last for a few (I have heavy chewers) minutes and are lower calorie than other options.  As others noted, they do not smell, which is always nice.",3
Mostly dead on arrival. My temperatures during shipping were fine and shouldn't have affected it but I think that these were just old worms.,2
Got this to donate to local animal shelter. Will order more soon!,5
"The cat looooved it until it was successfully destroyed! I had it hanging in the door jam of a hallway closet door. It constantly had his attention and was fun to watch.  He would flip and pounce around it. Such a very simple toy, but it was soooo worth it.",5
Pad is great!  Warms nicely.  Forget the cover. Very cheap.  Doesn't fit the product.  Dissatisfied with cover.,3
"Best toy ever.  I find them all over the house.  My cats like milk ties but lose them under furniture.  These are big enough so they don't go under the furniture except the TV stand..  I am missing some but I find them in the food dish, liter box and a stockpile from the kittys under the TV stand.  I think they are hiding them for another time.  Once they have one they don't stop playing with them for a long time then they go to sleep, exhausted from playing. Only toy that they play every day with.  I have a toybox full of toys but this is the only one they play with all the time.  I would recommend these to everyone with a cat.",5
Love love love these for my new kitten she didn't take long at all,5
"works as it should, only 4 stras cause it has a powder residue my dogs don't care for they both cough for the 1st few days until it wore off",4
"Fantastic deshedding comb and it removes a lot of the fur that our pomeranian sheds. Both after he has been bathed and blow-dried and daily when he wakes up, we first brush his fur with the Hertzko Self Cleaning Slicker Brush. After that, we use this deshedding comb three or four times to remove the fur that shed and it removes a lot of that fur to keep our pomeranian's fur neat and nicely groomed.",5
there are enough bells on this to make sure my dogs are heard when they need to out,5
Good quality. Works well. Just wish my cat would stop escaping his harness!,5
My dog adores these. Anything with peanut butter is great but frozen is even better. I highly recommend these for great summer treats.,5
"Our pet Heidi is very choosy
She does like the soft and chewey",4
Works great!,5
"UPDATE - This Product IS NOT WORTH 4 STARS simply because it is automatic.  I couldn't keep it in the bedroom because it is a motor after all and is by no means whisper quiet! The noise is enough to wake the dead. I could hear it from the living room.

  It takes 20 minutes to cycle after Kitty leaves the box. Sitting undisturbed  is my ""guesstimation"" on why the pee eventually sinks into the ENTIRE Slightly Plastic Covered CARDBOARD CARTRIDGE. It will need to be replaced WAAAAY before 2 weeks... at about $20 a cartridge (including S&H) you better have a bottomless bank account.

  I suggest using a thick piece of Plastic Carpet Protector under the entire unit. You will need it!  You can get it by the roll at Home Depot.

  The Cartridges Are OBSCENELY EXPENSIVE considering the use you get out of them.

  if you expect it to last EVEN TWO WEEKS, you need to remove the Poo EVERY FEW DAYS from the end of the cartridge, by hand - a pooper scooper really doesn't fit in the tiny covered area.  It is not that simple of a task. It takes awhile to pull it all out than just cleaning a regular kitty litter box. Bad back - NO WAY! You will need to wear GLOVES and a GAS MASK or hold your breath for a long time.

  I bought the DOME LID, over $25.00 with shipping, for the thing! But still, even with the hood - Phee-U-weey coming out from the front of the Litter box!

  The cat litter is less than 3 inches deep in the entire cartridge.  The more it cycles the litter goes down very quickly.

  I believe that helps contributes to the odor issue.

  I tried every type of Clumping Litter on the market. I also switched her to all dry Science Diet cat food.

  I even used the HEAVILY PERFUMED Multiple Cat Liter. The Poo BACKS UP in the tiny Poo catcher area.  It is about 4 or 5 inch wide by about 15 inches long, NOT REALLY DEEP, Poo catcher area. This is NOT the only issue that makes it fail the ""ODOR EATER TEST"" here.

  The rake just pushes the poo into the SPACE and the Poo accumulates and backs up very quickly. It is at the front of the box  - so the Dome Lid is useless.

  OH did I forget to mention the disgusting Poo that gets smeared and Gobs get stuck on your rake? You get big time stink there. Cleaning it is such a ""high."" It dries quickly if you do not get to it right away too.  It wouldn't come off with a knife as I tried to scrape it off.

  Also, the rake stops too soon when the Poo backs up because the little cardboard flap door stays open a smidgen from the backed up Poo.  **THE CYCLE STOPS** As in doesn't run anymore - won't cycle back to rake the next kitty dump.

  BTW - You will lose a lot of expensive Litter too. Every cycle, a bunch of GOOD LITTER will slide into the tiny Poo catcher, which also backed the Poo Catcher up very quickly!

  Oh Yes... I forgot to mention, Every changing you have to get rid of the huge CARDBOARD CARTRIDGE. Just try to move the HUGE Stinky, SOGGY, LIMP, Wet - don't forget HUGE disgusting Cartridge. And it really is HUGE and horribly stinky. It will always be dripping foul matter as you try and get it into a ""Lawn Size Garbage Bag.""  You will get drippings on your carpet or floor eventually. Murphys Law. The harder you try NOT to drip, you will miss the bag somewhere... usually while you are choking and trying to STOP THE GAG FACTOR!

Ask yourself this question.  What happens when a Cat pees on slightly plastic coated cardboard - over and over again for two weeks?

  I knew real quick I made a mistake here. They say it has a quiet motor and that didn't pan out.  Then, I was stuck having to pay $15.99 per cartridge and you don't save a PENNY buying the 3 pack! The shipping is OUTRAGEOUS! They got you by the nose hairs here if you buy this unit.

  It took me weeks to GIVE THIS EXPENSIVE set up, WITH HOOD away. Nobody wanted it. LOL

  I saved my money for months to replace this Stinky Monstrosity with the really Expensive LITTER ROBOT! It was worth every Penny. I have had it for over two years and never had an ODOR problem. I can use KITCHEN GARBAGE BAGS once a week. It ties shut and no odor there.

  BTW - NO LOSS OF GOOD LITTER EITHER. The Litter Robot sifts the litter out from the clumps and only the clumps goes down into the big deep drawer that is lined with a ""Kitchen Garbage"" bag. I get 15 for $.99 at the dollar store. That's 15 weeks for $.99.

  Also, I am not throwing away good litter and saving money there too! I buy a bucket of Fresh Step every couple of months.  My house is odor free and I have more than paid for this unit now with the money I saved by not paying $19.00 a cartridge every week and a half.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. You will replace it. I guarantee it.

Look at the long picture.
52 weeks in a year
Replace every 2 weeks...
26 weeks @ over $20.00 a cartridge if you include shipping.
That is $520.00 a year in soggy wet - dripping, stinky CARDBOARD cartridges that will leak all over your floor.
Not to mention all the litter you waste between the rake scooping it in the Poop Catcher area - and having to replace all the litter in the cartridge every changing.

If you can afford it... get the LITTER ROBOT - just Google it and see the amazing video. I suggest the one with the bubble for the cats to turn around in it. I have a small cat and she is cramped inside.  They didn't have that feature when I got mine.

Also if you have a BAD BACK... do not get this item. It requires more ""maintenance"" from Rake and Poo back up problems nearly every day. The problems require you to stay bent over for a long period of time and my back just couldn't take it!",1
great product!! Great seller!!,5
These work very well stay on for a long time.,5
I couldn't even get them out of the package and my little yorkie knew what they were! Tennis Balls are one of his favorites! He loves them!,5
Cute until you wash it then it fades a great deal.,3
"One of the best food you can buy for your dog.
I agree that there are many good dog food but this one has been perfect for my three German Shepherd dogs, no more digestive issues.",5
Dogs love these treats,5
Always reliable! This is great dewormer.,5
I only ordered this here because the local Walmart stores run out of stock? I can't believe it when 4 super Walmarts are out of stock for this. Our dog has super clean healthy teeth after 4 yrs. of using this so maybe it's working. Just one treat per day is all it takes to keep the dentist away.,5
I have an English Bulldog and this food has worked great as a no grain food,5
Love these!  Perfect!,5
very good,5
Got one for each of my yorkie and yorkie poo. Went up one size. Will make beautiful picture for Christmas. Did not take as long to get it as they said. Worth a couple of weeks waiting period.,5
"I was reluctant, but I actually like this better than Tidy Cat. Clumps better.",5
"Definitely a hit with the resident house panther. Ollie isn't big width wise, but he's long, and this shelf fits with some room left over. The heating element is just enough...not so much of a draw that your electric bill will spike; Definitely enough to be attractive to the felines. We permanently installed this because there is a lot oomph when he jumps up or off and we just felt better installing it with screws.

Definitely a high recommendation from my cat. :)",5
"Borrowed my friend's as I wanted to try it out before buying. Only three stars because it does run really hot as others have said. Running it on the highest speed makes it almost too hot to hold. Used the lower speed on my Standard Poodle and it worked well, but she didn't like the hot blade when I did her feet (used a #10). Bought a set of combs to use with this and gave them to my friend for the use of the clippers. The combs are a lot less expensive than buying more blades, and they do work if you take your time and let the clippers do the work. Just not as good as having more blades.",3
"I'm (and my dog most importantly) are REALLY happy with this bed.  I was quite hesitant on purchasing something this expensive, despite its big size.  However, my 14.5 y/o dog has quite serious osteoarthritis in her hips and elbows and hence has quite a bit of trouble moving around, let alone getting out of bed.  Her previous dog beds were about half the thickness of this bed and she recently began having issues getting up at all without help; which leads to frustration for her and everyone else.  So, we decided to get a bigger (thicker) bed, but of high quality foam for her osteoarthritis.  Suffice it to say that not only can she essentially now ""slide"" off this bed onto the floor as opposed to standing up off it (which makes it easier for her to get back up), but she sleeps very comfortably.  The latter point is important because we had a dog bed prior to this one where she could never get comfortable, despite it being labeled as having foam for osteoarthritis related issues.  Thankfully we had (and have) 2 other beds where she could rest just fine, but this is a nice replacement for the poorly made one that didn't do her any good.

I have only one complaint, or my dog does, actually.  She LOVES headrests and back rests (like the beds with the contoured foam/padding in a U shape around the bed).  This bed doesn't have it, and hence she didn't really like that until we supplemented the headrest already built in with some cylindrical pillows for the backrest and the headrest on the other side.

Otherwise, I wholeheartedly reccomend this bed.  Money well spent, and glad to hear it's made in the USA!!!

Update:  We've noticed that our dog now clearly prefers this orthopedic bed to the other 2 good ones we have at home, as she no longer gets up in the middle of the night to switch beds and instead sleeps in this one the entire night!  Clearly she really likes this one!",5
"Nice plant. Product as described in photo, had more stems than expected which is nice. Liked the texture of the leaves, looks different from other crypts.",5
works perfectly in the Drinkwell original fountain.  I will definitely buy again,5
Not good for a active IW puppy.  Will not last.,2
"I bought this ear wash for my pregnant dog and now she is lactating, so being as it is all natural it works for me since you need to be careful what you use on pregnant and lactating dogs.  It also doesn't have the burning kind of alcohol in it so it doesn't hurt tender or raw tissues in her ears. It has chamomile and cloves in it.  I think  it seems to help.",5
My dog has a habit of pulling during our walks. Especially when she sees a squirrel. This was so helpful preventing that. Walks are a lot more pleasant,5
I bought two of these.  One for each of my 94+ pounds dogs.  They both love it.,5
Cats love it. Not dangerous. My cats play with any little metal thing they find no matter what I hide from them and they haven't had a single injury in 9 years. These are the only commercial toys they will play with.,5
have not used yet but very cool,5
"Great for travel, hikes, or just to share a bottle of water in your car. Thank you, happy pup!!",5
My 60 lb. puppy loves this bed!,5
The dog doesn't use it!  Nothing wrong with it!  Stubborn puppy!,5
"I shopped around for this product and found the best price through Amazon.  The company selling Cosequin offered a better price through Amazon than they did on their own site.  Great job, Amazon.  I'll always check with you first!",4
"High quality, delivered on time, great price. One of the best files I have found for use on my dogs.",5
"You never go wrong when you order from Josh's Frogs! Fast delivery, good value, and excellent customer service!",5
Great bowl! It arrived bigger then expected but I am very happy,5
"I bought this for my dog who likes to steal my dad's spatulas and chew them up.  She has gone through like at least 72 of them.  I thought it might be better for her to have a safer wood toy.  I bought a few to try out, and this was the only one she liked.  For instance, the one with the edible adhesive was not at all exciting.  This was great, though, except for the fact my other dog got jealous so I had to buy another.  When I told my friends about it, I realized how many people had problems with dogs who loved to eat wood so they also decided to give this chew a go.  So, why not try to supervise your doggo and try to give them their own wood loaf if they are already eating many bad woods?  My dog is pleased to have her very own wood bread thing.  Hopefully this will stop her spatula eating ways.",5
"This is absolutely my favorite dog bowl set! I was tired of having to clean up my Boston Terrier's mess after he ate. Often times, he would either spill his water on the floor or his food would get everywhere. I have nothing but great things to say about this item.

This product comes with a blue bone shaped light weight silicone mat. It not only holds the bowls in place but it will catch any mess that your dog makes for easier clean up. This comes with 2 stainless steel bowls which are a perfect size for my dog and would work well for a bigger sized dog too.

I like that it is so easy to clean. The bowls are easy to remove and can be thrown in the dishwasher or the sink. The silicone mat can just be rinsed right off in the sink.

I am so happy that I purchased this product. It has over exceeded my expectations. This is a great product all around and would be great for your dog or cat!

Disclosure: A complimentary product was provided to me for trial and evaluation. I have no connection to the seller or the manufacturer. My reviews are based solely on my perception of the merits of a product and not on price which may vary with the seller as well as the competitive marketplace.",5
I love to add this to frozen food as the fish are really active feeders when this has been added to their food!,5
"I ordered this because I needed something to help keep foster kittens from climbing out of the kennel and it had a great price. On the upside, the grommets are placed every twelve inches. This helped greatly in reducing gaps along the edges.  On the downside, the kennel cover is more like 10 1/2 feet by 10 1/2 feet in size. I had to rig up metal pipes to wrap the excess net around to prevent it from sagging in the middle. So far, the kittens, who love to climb, have not managed to find a way out, much to my relief.",4
My cat ate 2 of them then refused to touch them again.  I feel like I wasted my money.  I wish they would make a hairball product that my Siamese would eat.  Sorry but I bought this due to the reviews so now I have a product that is just sitting there.  If I could get my money back I'd be happy then.,1
"This toy has been very much enjoyed buy our teething pet. Its groves seemed to soothe her sore dentition, Most of all she has not been able to destroy it.",5
"Elk is the choice of Antlers my dog likes and he is a picky one.  He is a Pit Bull and can chew up most anything in a matter of minutes, not these elk antlers.  These last a while for heavy chewers and the price point on Amazon is great!  Buy a few and give them at the same time.  No dog is bored with these and they love getting to the center, kinda like a tootsie pop for dogs :)",5
my cat loves it !  great deal.,5
Works great and the bags are nice quality. They stay inside the bone when they're not needed but are easy to pull out when they are.,5
Works good,4
I wish this would be a bit bigger for pups but they did not realty care for it they just left it alone,2
The dogs love this toy. Great size.,5
New kittens just went right to it and started scratching away.,5
"This is a very innovative way to groom your kitty, in the sense that removing the trapped fur is easy-peasy. The only downside is that the wire irritate my cats skin (as most wire brushes do), even if I am super gentle. The other thing is that it's rather wide, so getting hard to reach areas is difficult during grooming sessions.

All in all, it's a fabulous grooming tool, and I would recommend it to any fellow cat (or even dog) owners who have cats who shed heavily!",4
"Excellent Quality, best Automatic waterier on the market.  Perfect size for a small to medium dog or Cat.  Easy to clean and heavy enough to not get knocked around.",5
"This was the perfect solution to canned food to take on a long road trip with my dogs.  No need for refrigeration or utensils to scoop the food. Easy to divide into portions and serve. Zip lock top and bag kept contents fresh and prevented unwanted access by my opportunistic Aussies (Up to a certain point, that is!). Good nutrition and my pups love Stella's products!",5
Kills fleas fast! The only complaint is that it dries out my Yorkiechon's  (yorkie mixed with Bichon Frise) skin. He now has super flaky skin that causes him to itch even though the fleas are gone. all in all it's a great product but I would recommend the kind with oatmeal to soothe the skin :),5
great product,5
"batteries are hard to change, and they wear quickly, maybe because I don't know when the device is on or off unless I try it on my self first. It is hard to know if you pare the hand held with the collar. It should be simple maybe have some kind of steady light that tells if it is on or off, I don't like it.",3
Works great for my 4#. Little girl,5
This is so much fun to watch.  Kitty loves it.,5
The small size is still too wide for my cat,1
"Found large (~2"") piece of partially melted plastic fused into turkey pellets. Need better quality control. Could have been quite dangerous if swallowed.",2
Just ok. Not really necessary,3
"Great idea. I like that it does not flop around like other bag holders do. However, the velcro became unusable after about 2 months, and no longer sticks together. I would buy another though.",4
Cat immediately starting playing with this. I'ts not a cheap product and I think it will last for awhile. Most important of all - the cat loves it.,5
My Shih Tzu loves her new harness because it is lightweight and simple to step into. She is only 10 pounds and the small was a perfect fit.,5
My puppy loves this. You can put treats in side or freeze it with peanut butter inside.,5
"This dog food gets very high reviews from reputable dog food critics.  Grain free means fewer allergies for my pups.  This is really one of the best dog foods, and the price is great on amazon!",5
"This is the only device that has successfully kept my cats off the counters. It does run out of batteries somewhat quickly but as long as it's on the counter I want to keep them off of, the cats avoid it.",5
My 16 lb. dog loves this little bed.  I bought the canopy to go with it but it doesn't block the sun.,5
Amazing price and just like the ones at Petco!,5
"We had a cheaper cover purchased on Amazon that was no where close to the quality of this one.  It was made out of umbrella type material.  Our dog pulled it apart and tore it up gradually over a month until the front flap was gone. We searched for a better one and came upon this.

Each side has it's own window, that can be either zipped, or velcro sealed.  The top, and sides and back are velcro and can be rolled up and have their own velcro fasteners to keep them in a rolled position.  Under that flap is netting to keep the dog from being able to pull the rolled up or flap down sides inside.  The front flap zips closed or can be placed on top of the kennel folded back. This is made out of a canvas type thicker material.  We have now had this for a month and I waited to do the review because I was sure our 50 pound husky/lab was going to tear it up.  She hasn't done a thing to it, there is not one part chewed or pulled inside the kennel.

As a side note, as someone else mentioned, we always leave one side opened or rolled up (usually the sides near the walls) to allow air flow or it will get hot inside.",5
"bought to replace a strap that is now too short, works well",5
This product seems to be better than what I was using although vet told me to alternate brands. Dog doesn't seem to start scratching as soon with this product so will continue using it.,5
"Seems to work well, can listen and talk to my dogs when I'm away. Picture is fairly good...",4
I did love the construction of the bed. So far it is chew proof . The only thing I didn't realize is that the fabric it solid. I thought it was mesh. Our Bouvier would like the air flow better if it were mesh.  Hot weather comes she will not use it.,4
I thought this would be great for my cats but all of them choked on the dry papery texture! I do not recommend,1
Put on my new 6 month old kitten after he wasn't blending well with my other cat. seemed to help him relax some and allow them to adjust.,3
Didn't work for my dog.,1
"I bought this for my Ragdoll who is big at 19 lbs. I like that it's large enough for him so that he's not feeling cramped. Having the cover helps to keep the litter inside, so no messes outside. I am not using the door but it's easy to attach if I change my mind. I have used several types of litter boxes in the past, but none have had to high sides and cover configuration quite like this one. Highly recommend it.",5
"I sure hope these socks hold up because they are the best I've purchased so far. I am a 280lb man with large calves. I only wear a size 11 shoe so getting compression socks over my calves has been a huge issue. Most that actually fit do not provide enough compression to keep my ankles from swelling. Until I found these, I actually had to supplement loser socks with ankle braces. Now, one sock that fits AND compresses. Sadly, I have a computer desk job, so all day at the office and blood pools in my ankles. As a border-line diabetic with a heart condition, this could quite literally be a life or death issue. These do the trick!  I just bought two more pair. Next paycheck I'll buy more. Too early to tell how well they will last, but so far they darn sure do the job for a large man wearing size Large.",5
Great price and looks like it is built to last. Our Lab loves to chew and I like the ability to replace the plastic bottle in side. I also was able to put a squeaker in it.,5
"This is a quality bag of food for the price. It smells like salmon. On one hand, that makes it appear to be higher quality. On the other hand, your dog's breath may smell like salmon.",5
They are as described. Pretty thin. Crush easily.,3
"I had several regular sized Chuckit that I like, but as my lab grew up ...  I worried more and more about the size of the ball and the larger size of his mouth...and he loves to jump up and catch a ball in the air.  THIS MEGA Ball size is perfect for my dog...it's definitely too large to slip down his throat by mistake when he is super excited playing ball.  However, it's not too large of a ball either....he can still catch it in mid air.",5
"It's such a creative idea. It works really well. Just follow the instructions and you should be able to collect everything in the collecting bin. However, if you have clumps that are stuck to the litter box, you might have to smack the box once or twice to get it off. For the really tough ones, you need to go in there with a litter box scoop.",5
Best quality I've seen in a long time,5
"I'm very pleased with my purchase of the medium harness for my 7 month Japanese spitz puppy ( I think that's equivalent to a mini American Eskie). She's 7 kg (15 pounds) with a 52cm chest circumference. It's a great fit now, and with adjusting, will fit her even at full size and with her full coat.  Prior to this she used a Puppia type soft harness where you slip the head through - she had no trouble with that, but even after only using this Rogz harness for 3 days, I can see she loves this so much more.  It gives much better control to walk with, it's easier too for her to run alongside me and must surely feel cooler too without all that nylon around her neck and chest. Also the step-in style with one clip is so simple to get on and off.

The pink's a lovely colour - I usually avoid all pink for dogs, but I love this and am now considering a matching leash.  The reflective stripes can feel a bit sharp - I ended up having to snip the ends in a few places.  Some of the glue used to seal the ends can be a bit sharp too.

One tip : at first I had trouble working out which strap was top and bottom, as the two straps are adjusted slightly differently to fit infront and behind her shoulders.  Even though it has the Rogz label which fits on the left, I ended up using a Sharpie to write ""L TOP"" along the upper strap where the left paw goes, and it makes it much easier - I just lay it on the floor so I see L TOP and she puts her paws in the right way.  The straps can twist around a bit too, so make sure the buckles face out and not against the dog's fur.

The only downside is that the centre strap is not ideal for car use - in the state of Australia where I live, by law dogs must be restrained in vehicles.  I hate the idea of having the car harness, then switching to a walking harness (car harness is too heavy and cumbersome for walking), then back to the car harness, so I have been using this one in the car. I may try to insert some detachable thicker padding along the middle to make it more suitable for the car.",5
"I purchased these Smart Bone dog chew sticks for a dog I rescued last year, who is very nervous and high strung.  Chewing things calms him down a lot, so I am always looking for new chews to surprise him with.  I like that these chews aren't made of rawhide, so they are much safer for my dog to chew.  They are made of digestible ingredients such as corn, sweet potatoes, glycerin, etc.

When I give him one, he takes it right away, settles himself down in a comfortable spot, and happily chews away for probably 45 minutes to an hour.  He hasn't had any digestive problems or choked on any of the sticks.  He is 15 pounds and these chews are a great size for him.  So far, so good.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five, is because I don't know that the product's claims that it benefits the ""skin and coat"" are true, and there's no real way to assess that.",4
"My dog constantly got ear infections and I made costly visits to the vet.  When I started using this on a weekly visit, his ear infections stopped.  Good product to use and highly effective.",5
I love these treats and my dog does too!  She is allergic to chicken and sweet potatoes so finding something she can eat can be a challenge.  She loves all of the varieties of the Fruitables treats and will follow me around when I have them.,5
"For barking dogs, or scaring off coyotes I recommend this air spray highly, it works",5
"I have tried every type/brand of harness for my Aussie mix Ginger!  She always backs up and manages to slip out of every harness no matter how tight they are (2 she somehow ate through!!). She is definitely an escape artist!! This harness is by far the best one weve purchased! It super easy to get on, has a ring in front and back for a leash, and a handle. It even came with a clip to attach in the car. In the beginning I clipped the leash to the front of the harness bc it stopped Ginger from pulling me. Now I can use the back ring. So it not only keeps her firmly attached in it, it has also stopped her from pulling!! This harness is amazing, I only wish I had bought it sooner!! Please don't let the price deter you, its the best harness we've ever had and the only one we will use from now on!!",5
good stuff.,5
"Oh man, does my dog love this! Great quality, fun design.",5
"These are my favorite litter boxes.  They are perfect, sturdy, keeps litter in, but cat can easily get into box. If there are 4 high sides I find cats leap out and litter is kicked liter everywhere. With this box they just walk out. What I don't like.  The label is Impossible to remove! And each litter box was shipped individually in a huge shipping cardboard box. I wish they had put all 3 together into one box.",5
Great for pugs.,5
Molly Cat Loves these treats . . . twice a day!,5
The Jackson Galaxy toys that can be used for the retractable cat teaser is one of the best made toys I have ever purchased. I have 3 cats and every cat loves all their toys from Jackson Galaxy. I haven't purchased one they have not played with yet.,5
"I have purchased these 3 times for my dogs and other family dogs.  They don't tear them up, but instead walk around with one in their mouths... So cute.",5
GREAT PRODUCT!!,5
"These tags are light and the colors look great. I feel safer now that my furry kids have these on their collars since it has their long microchip numbers (can't believe they fit and the numbers are legible). Thanks!

Make sure to read the directions on how to give instructions for engraving. I almost missed it but there they were, as part of the description which reads ""IN THE GIFT MESSAGE INPUT (1) Shape, (2) Color, (3) Engraving Information - up to 4 lines of text on each side / up to 18 characters per line""

Highly recommend these tags :)",5
Give this to my older dog.  It has really helped her cognitively.  She used to appear lost.  She now longer acts like this and has a spark back in her eyes.,5
"my dogs love the kyjen dog toys, we have several of them.  they last as good as many of the others and are economical.",5
"My dog stopped pulling immediately however the leash (harness) can easily slip down his chest to his tummy, requires constant readjustment.  This leash will be in a weekly rotation instead of the go-to I had hoped it for.  My dog is small, 16 pounds.",4
"This is the only food we feed our ragdoll cat. He has had urinary problems in the past so we have eliminated dry food in order to keep him very well hydrated. Since starting his food several years ago, he has had no further health problems. He is always eager to eat this food and always licks his bowl clean. We feel that this food is made with good ingredients yet is still affordable, especially in cases of 12 large cans.",5
This wire is great for the underground fence. It comes on a great spool for easy installation. It is a tad thin but I haven't had any issues with it. I lay it down and bury it a few inches. It seems pretty weather proof.,5
Smaller then expected.,3
"This product worked great on my dog until we got a little in her eye by accident during her last bath.  Despite flushing it out with her usual eye drops after the bath, It burned her eye, resulting in a corneal ulcer.  So after several hundred dollars in emergency vet visits and prescriptions, a week of uncomfortable cone wearing, and medication every 6 hours for a week, we will be shopping for a tearless shampoo instead.  My poor baby has been suffering a lot.",3
Lasted two days with my German shepherds. Two out of the three were 6 month old puppies and one adult. I bought the largest one and they had it shredded in no time. Then they eat the strings which is NOT good coming out the rear end if you know what i mean. It was beautiful color wise. Really wished it was tougher because they love it so much.,2
"This is a first for us, our big dog chews every toy we give her to pieces.  This bone like toy she loves and after a couple of months it still looks like new.  Good chew toy",5
"This is a great harness. Fits my medium size dog well. I actually use the included strap instead of my traditional leash. Once you get it fit and adjusted on the first wear, it's easy on and off.",5
"My cat absolutely loved this toy until it broke in less than a week.

Purchased a new one, which also broke in less than a week.

Cats absolutely love these, the commercials are right too bad that they're so poorly constructed. Stay away if you value your money.",2
"Was impressed with this and all that you get. The cage is good. Needs a little reinforcement which I will do wit zip ties. I have a love bird which is a good size because comes out to play a lot.  Wouldn't use for a bird much bigger than a cocktail.  A wood perch was warped, called company and they are sending another . They were nice and helpful. Fast delivery. I have to tell you that this company is awesome!  If have a problem with any item. Contact the company and they will go above and beyond to help you and get you any replacements,and you get to talk to a real person!",5
I adopted a dog that was so nervous he would go a couple of days without eating. He was so skinny. This food got him started and were now able to mix in dry kibble and hes at a normal weight. He also loves this as treats.,5
We have used Caster & Pollux products for several years and this brand of food is enjoyed by our pooch and have given it 5 stars as we enjoy organic foods and feel that our pooch deserves the organic lifestyle as well. I am taking a wait and see attitude however regarding the Nestle buyout and will see if Nestle changes the formula in which case our star value would drop.,5
First time I've ever used this product and it works amazing. We use it for so many things. I will without a doubt be purchasing this product from now on!,5
works really well,5
great.,5
"Cats go crazy for it! A bit expensive, but seems to be a good product.",5
PRICEY but well worth it. Very easy to clean and my snake can't knock it down and spill water everywhere!,5
I appreciate its helping me keep my dog healthy and fit,5
has a nice citrusy scent and works great to remove pet odors :-),5
I have 2 small 11 pound dogs.  This crate fits up against the dog door just great.  When the dogs come in they are in a crate (not using the bathroom in the house or eating the furniture!) but they can also go out in the yard.  The crate also sort of rolls on the floor (I haven't tried it on carpet).,4
"I can't believe what a difference this product has made to my fish tanks water. The water cleared up in just a few hours, I've used an electric gravel cleaner and added plants, tried a solution, to help clear it up. Someone recommended adding this and now I can't imagine being without it. I'm sure my fish and frog are happy to have the water cleaner and when they're doing well, I'm happy. I definitely recommend using this, it's fantastic!!",5
"Smells great - wish it were more effective with my geriatric, pacing dog.",4
"It's a charcoal filter. What's there to say? It filters. These fit neatly into the Drinkwell fountain, which we've used for a few years and like a lot. You could probably easily repurpose these for other uses - each filter is just sort of a packet with charcoal inside and on one face. There's no way to tell by looking at one if it needs to be changed; something you'll just want to keep track of yourself.",5
This light as a weird color but my plants are doing really well so I am sticking with it. The fish seem healthier too.,5
Our rescue kitties love this brand,5
"Although I love the design, I was disappointed to discover there was no place to attach my dog's tags on the lower chest side of the harness.
I had to return it because of that fact. Otherwise it's a brilliant design.",3
"Good product, good price",4
Good for a picky eater,5
My dog loves these and they are good for her.,5
"great product, my dog loves it",5
I like how you can cover the little mesh windows to keep the critter inside out of the elements or if they are too stressed. Works great!,4
color not as shown.,3
My dog liked these bones.,3
My puppy quickly figured out how to get The tube insert out which makes getting the treats much easier,2
This filter seems to do its job.  I wished the carbon pad would last longer but it does a reasonable job.,3
My cats didn't like these but they're super picky so yours likely will.,3
"Good price, but you get what pay for!  HARD TO CLICK, DELAYS CLICK, SO, IT'S USELESS AS A MARKER FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR!",1
Love it,5
"1. My cats didn't care about this at all.  They stared at it for 5 minutes before they walked away (but, you know, cats...)
2. The pouch seemed too loose on top, like the mouse toy maybe couldn't be seen moving well enough for it to really grab the cats attention? What did initially get their attention about it was the noise the mouse made.
3.  The mouse (and the 2 AAA batteries) seemed to heat up fast, not just get a little warm as would be expected.  After about 5 minutes of trying (and failing) to get the cats to play with this, I went to turn the mouse off and it hot.  Not burning hot but hot enough to cause a bit of concern and it took a while for the batteries to fully cool down.
4.  The cats may not be really interested in this as a toy, but they'll be using the blue pouch as a new pad to sit and sleep on. Maybe they're just too old to be entertained by this, I can see younger kittens having fun with this.
(My cats declined to write this review themselves or provide any further comment)",2
Seems to leave my carpet sticky...,2
"I bought the Kyjen Duck and Pig, and all I can say is wow... Are they small or what! This isn't Amazon's or Kyjen's error. In fact, it is mine. I should have read the description. I purchased this for around $6.00 through Amazon (give or take a few pennies). For a toy this small, it is borderline expensive... Especially considering the fact that it IS made in China. The pig has a sound box inside it, which does deliver noise to entice a dog's curiosity. I don't think this will stand the test of time though, even if you're like me and you supervise all toy play time with your dog.",3
Nice size antler. My dogs love them!,5
My kitties love this cat food! It's a very good cat food for indoor cats.,5
This is very durable and is also easy to clean. It fits the backseat perfectly and keeps our dog from getting mud and water everywhere. Highly recommended.,5
"I used to groom dogs, This is a really nice set of scissors.  They are also a good quality and I am sure they will last for quite some time.",5
"This leash was great. It was heavy, high quality leather that withstood rain and held up to my very energetic Great Dane puppy. The hardware was solid all around and I would highly recommend if you're looking for a regular (but sturdy) leather leash for an affordable price.",5
"Compact and easy to carry, but smaller than I expected",3
a little small around neck for my french bulldog,4
"I don't know why, but I find the double name hilarious. How clever! Also, my bulldog is a heavy chewer and except for a few small holes, this guy is in pretty good shape! We'll repurchase when she inevitably destroys him in a few months. Very nice product!",5
"Awesome!  Dogs don't mind the pack on their back.  Fits great, tough and rugged",5
the back corners will not lay flat after it gets slightly wet ever again.,3
"Pretty basic and kinda ugly looking. Mine looks different than the picture, it has a matte clear coating, while the picture looks super shiny clear. The coating does scratch off, I put the side to the door that came with tape and was directed to put on door. Disappointing because plastic has not been torn just looks like it has from coating. Plastic was also expected to be thicker. This will most likely not last long if you have a heavy duty scratcher like my puppy who does not like being left alone yet. SO she will scratch for like 15 min, three times a day. At this rate the plastic will be done within the month.

On the plus side this is cheaper than other options so if you have a light scratcher this would be a great product.",3
3 out of 3 dogs approve!,5
I have a cat who loves to climb everywhere and knocks things off all the time. This really works at scaring her away. I saved the empty can and just leave it where I don't want her to climb! :-),5
Just as desrcibed.,5
"Just ordered several more of these, works great for protecting leather furniture and I use it on a flat area rug as a dog bed, my pups love it, also use it at entrances from the back yard and cuts down on dirt, etc. I especially like the type of non-stick backing can be put in the dryer without ruining the backing.",5
My cats seem to really like this food.  I was feeding them food from Costco and wanted to switch to something better.  The only problem was that the bag I got had busted open and had been taped back.  I thought for the price that I was paying for a brand new item with no defects.,4
"Works great in the bunny cage, keeps'em from wasting so much hay and is pleasing to the eye. Like a little miniature horse manger.",5
"These are pretty durable and my puppy loves them! With other tennis balls, she literally destroys them within an hour, but she hasn't done that with these!",5
"I have a shitzu who is 2 yrs old, and he chewed this bone up in like a hour. I bought a bigger one and he did the same thing...Not recomended",2
"Two things come to mind.
One: my small puppy (< 3 lbs) still leaves wet tracks when he steps off the pad, but then, so did the previous ones.  We'll probably try another brand next time.

Two:  there is orange printing on the back side.  My puppy peed on the mat and, at first, I thought there was blood in his urine.  Then I realized it was the orange printing that had become more visible because of the liquid.  Just about scared the daylights out of me.  Maybe they should change the color of the printing to blue, purple or something else.

EDIT:  The company has proactively contacted me. They are sending a replacement package of pads!  I absolutely give them 5 STARS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I will see how the replacement pads perform before reassessing the rating for the product.",3
Very bright and cheerful  collars.  I got one for each of my 3 dogs.  I am happy with the product.,5
Bought this for my 4 month old black lab puppy.  It was much too wide (1 inch) for it to be comfortable around her neck.  Overall it seems like a solid product and was very bright and may purchase again when she is older but for small dogs beware.,3
"Our fussy eater Dog likes it, I usually mix a little something else, like unsalted, boiled chicken etc. to the kibble and he cleans up his bowl :)",5
My Yorkie didn't like this treat but he is really picky! But loves chicken flavor soft things and I don't think this was soft enough for him.,2
"works on my dog but it seems that he gets an adrenaline rush for the first minutes after I give it to him. After that, he relaxes.",4
My cat finally started to use this and she is so cute in it.,5
bought for my niece. Her older dog is having digestive issues so hope it helps.,4
decent,4
great product,5
"I purchased this as a potential replacement for Azodyl for my CKD kitty (doesn't need to be refrigerated and can be mixed with food).  Provided your cat does not also have glucose issues, then I would recommend this to see if the BUN and Creatinine go down for your kitty.

However, I did notice that kitty became constipated (a problem with CKD cats, as their water absorption is wonky).  After five days, I reintroduced Azodyl - problem solved by the next day.  Although, I was still using the powder too.  I figured, why not?

Then, my kitty was diagnosed with diabetes (blood sugar had been rising steadily prior to introducing the powder).  I contacted the manufacturer, and they stated the ""maltodextrin content is approximately 50%, thus 1 measure is 250 mg in Maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is an oligosaccharides the powder is 50% maltodextrin.""  They claimed it is safe for diabetics, although ""Maltodextrin may affect blood sugar level in the same way other carbohydrates do, only when consumed in large amounts.""  What they deem is a large amount is beyond me.  After scouring the internet, and talking with two vets, it was decided this product would indeed be high on the glycemic index and was a no-no for my kitty.  Your vet might disagree.

I decided not to take any chances, and I was told even one little pill pocket, at only 3 calories, could spike kitty's glucose.  It's all about the ingredients, not necessarily carbs.",3
dogs loved them,5
My dogs love this treat. Even my older dog is able to gum it until it is soft enough to eat. I order it about once a month.,5
Great pad was great for original price.  Now the price jacked up. :(  I have 6 rescues so the price really helped me before now I cant buy it.  I had 16 rescues so every penny counts especially when it comes to saving lives!,3
"I needed something inexpensive to get me to the next level for free shipping.  I decided to try this as it looked like a toy my cat would enjoy.  My cat loves it! At first I thought it may be a waste of money because it is a piece of fabric attached to a string.  It has taken the abuse my cat gives it and is still together.  Shake it back and forth and it looks like one of those ribbons they use for ribbon dancing. I'm glad I needed something to fill the order - if my cat does break this one, I won't hesitate to buy another one.",5
"I got this to exercise my lab in a way that appeases her natural instinct to retrieve. After several months of use, the launcher is still going on a daily basis. She (the lab) doesn't like the fabric ball as much as the whistler ball we ended up buying her and using with this launcher, but it is still an excellent product to prevent touching the ball. In the winter it helps preventing my hands from freezing, and it consistently prevents me from touching a slobbery and dirty ball. We have a fairly large-sized back yard for a suburban neighborhood and the junior launcher was a perfect fit for our throwing needs (e.g. meaning that I didn't need the larger size as it would fly into my neighbors yard). The launcher is about a foot and a half and has withstood being lightly chewed on. Should I ever get a bigger or smaller yard, I will buy another Chuckit! to use for that yard.",5
My dog will not touch this food. He is a finicky eater-chihuahua rat terrier mix. If you have a small finicky eater don't buy this product,1
"Flat, no padding. None of our three dogs have played with these.",3
"I have a Samoyed. This Dyson Groom Tool Clean Up Kit is an amazing thing. It is not the pre-collapsed as-seen-on-TV blue 'self cleaning' slicker, this actually has some substance to it. It attached to my non-Dyson vacuum easily and I filled the (big) vacuum bin in just a few stroke and release moves. I have arthritis in my wrists and thumbs so I thought it may be too much for me, but I can use it for long enough at a time to make a difference. It is actually easier to use than the regular slicker brushes and there is less wasted motion used in removing the hair from the bristles and disposing of it. I go with the direction of fur growth, then against the direction of fur growth in 1 inch steps and the Samoyed looks and feels great! I also have three small smooth terrier types that want what the Sammy gets and I can use this on them with the bristles retracted, and the cats in the house also come for their attention. The remainder of the kit I have little interest in, but if the need comes up I am certain that the quality and usefulness will be consistent. If you have used a slicker brush in the past, this is the ultimate version. Spoil yourself and your pet AND keep your home cleaner.",5
Great colors and the little one we bought it for loves it she is crazy about peacocks and loves this one to.,5
My dogs love to play tug of war with this and is proving to be durable. The braided body of the toy makes it easy for my dogs to grip on during gig of war. I also like there are different sizes available and different animals/colors you can choose from.,5
My Doberman puppy likes to chew on this leash... It is very strong! I know it's not the right thing to do but sometimes it's the only way I can drive around town without being disturbed.  He is just four months old and will be starting training soon. The colors are vibrant the quality is excellent and I would highly recommend it!  I even got the matching color!,5
Looks like an uncomfortable sex toy but works great as a chew toy for dogs as well!,5
perfect kennel for my toy fox terrier,5
"Well, technically I don't love them - I'm not eating these things, but my dog loves 'em!",5
great filter pad,5
"This is the best filter for the value I've found, and it's not too loud. I've had two of them for probably a year now with no problems.",5
I can't really tell if this works. It doesn't seem to make much difference for my moody cats.,3
"My pups love these, and they really last a long time too",5
Have only used this harness once so far and the padded chest panel is a little stiff but the neck and rib straps are fully adjustable to fit any dog. The straps don't contain the loose ends. So we will figure that out next time. The tether has a secure clasp rather than a clip. It suited our needs. We didn't use the tether yet.,5
"I've used freeze dried krill before for a large reef setup. I just have a small 20 gallon tank for my puffer now. These krill smell disgusting. The ones I used previously had almost no smell after rehydrating them - similar to fresh krill. These smell like they were left out too long before being freeze dried. The only reason it gets 3 stars is because of the low price and the fact that my puffer seems to love them, although I'm a little concerned about feeding them to him.",3
"I bought two of the sleepypod harnesses after seeing videos of crash tests done with dummy dogs (if you're a dog owner, google it, scary stuff!) These are the only harnesses that passed the crash tests. I have 2 belgian malinois; these harnesses fit well and seem to be comfortable on the dogs. It gives me peace of mind when my dogs are wearing their harnesses in the car. You can clip a leash on the harnesses to use them for walking and running, too. The harnesses aren't the least expensive on the market, but compared to the value of your dogs' life, the cost is minimal.",5
"I like this product.  Cats don't need fragrance and honestly who wants the oder of cat poop plus fragrance? Controls oder well. If you clean the box often enough it won't smell like ammonium anyway. This has gone 2 days in a pinch and stood up well with little to no oder. Clumps pretty well--yes small pieces at times but most urine is a hockey puck.  I got a hand held colander scoop to occasionally filter the small pieces and these grains are small enough for that. It's soft on kitty paws. The cats use it no problems unlike scented versions of other litters  or scented version of this one. Tracking is average to better than average. No litter is no tracking . Dust is much MUCH better than other brands I have tried. While using a thick layer helps prevent this some less clumped sticky spots on bottom at times; a reasonably sturdy scooper can scrape them into pieces that clump and scoop at that point. 21 lb box is a better value than the smaller or larger sizes and does the job of a heavier box of regular clumping litter. Not perfect but excellent and best combo of lighter, soft, low dust and good oder control without added fragrance I have found--probably as good as it gets. I can't find it locally so now order online shopping is free with order of $35 or more.",5
Excellent! Excellent! Excellent product! My dogs simply love it!,5
"I bought this harness for my Doberman Pinscher and so far I am very satisfied with it.  We needed to purchase an XL since her chest is very deep.
My initial observation is that the harness is really well made.  The padding on the inner portion is soft and not very thin like other harnesses we tried.  The harness is easy to put on and the adjustment to size is very simple. I also like the fact that there is a lock on the snap-in buckle, which means the harness will not unsnap by an accident. The handle on top of the harness is great for controlling the dog. It is sturdy and it feels secure.
The reason I am giving this harness a 4 star rating is because the control of dog's pulling is not as effective as with my previous harness (different design). My dog pulls more with this harness, not terribly more, but enough for me to notice the difference. Even though she pulls more I like this harness much better than my previous one.  My major reason for switching to this harness is the fact that the hoop to which you attach the leash to in on the top(over the shoulders).  My previous harness attached at the bottom (below dog's neck), which  irritated her upper leg/shoulder area.  There is no such irritation or discomfort with this harness.  I also noticed that my dog has more pep and is more spunky when she walks.  That in itself is a sign that she prefers this harness over her previous one.
Overall, I am very happy with this harness and would definitively recommend it to anyone in the market for new dog harness.",4
For some reason this is my Australian Shepherd's favorite out of all the other Chuckit balls. The squeaker doesn't last long but he still loves it. I have to keep extras on hand in case one gets lost.,5
nice product fits my dog well,5
These litter boxes are great for using in crates at cat adoptions. They also work well for small kittens.,5
My dog didn't care for these much. They are also quite hard.,3
"Labrador Retriever Puppy. Sthe breeder waited until she was 10 weeks old before I could pick her up.  She is now 7 months old and weighs in at 35 pounds.

The good first:
It was pretty easy to setup. The divider was a bit difficult, but I got it done. I don't need it any longer.
It was nice to have a divider as she grew.

Now the bad:
1.  One of the doors on the crate (referring to the two front doors or if you prefer, the front and back) the top loop that the door hing slides in to spread wide open. I tried to bend the loop back in to shape with a vice grip, but it couldn't be corrected property. It can be open and closed with a lot of manipulation (some may consider that to be good news)
2. I have recently turned the crate around because manipulating the side with the top loop issue was becoming too unreliable.  On this side, the bottom loop that the hinge slides in to is beginning to spread open and this too is beginning to make it difficult to open and close.

I purchased the professional because it claims professional grade steel.  Unfortunately, the ultimate pro three door is failing.",2
"Because I own sighthounds, a martingale collar is a must. My newest family edition, my whippet Freyja, easily slips this particular style. Furthermore, the nylon is beginning to fray in areas. My other dogs own Lupine combo collars, which this has not happened with. However, I do like the buckle attachment, as this feature is difficult to find on Martingales.",3
"This is what I used to feed my cat daily. Then I was told by a vet assistant not to buy food with ""chicken meal"" as the #1 ingredient. She said it's too stressful on their organs and could lead to organ failure. ""Chicken meal"" is what's left of a chicken after you take all the meat off the bones. In other words, this food (#1 ingredient) is made from the crap which usually ends up in the trash.",2
"Cat loves this, and it stops the hairballs as she constantly cleans herself",5
"Got this for my 5 mo. old pup & he loves it! Just got this product this week & my pup loves to play with it even w/o being filled with treats. I like that it's too big to fit in his mouth too b/c I don't have to worry about it being a choking hazard for him. I bought the 5"" size & have not bothered to put treats in it as yet but he's been having fun pushing it around & chasing it. Would recommend to others but want to note that it is a hard plastic, not soft.",5
I am SURE we will be ordering these for years!! She takes them into her crate and hides them for later!!,5
"Omg I love this bag so much, its very well made!! and its really roomy for my 3lbs dog :)",5
"Best item I could have ever bought for my cat!  Only wish it was a little wider as the first time he got up on it (put catnip all over), he tried to roll over on the top and almost fell.  But, he loves it and every time my hubby and I sit down to watch T.V., there he is, laying on top of it, stretched out like a king on his throne!  Definitely going to tell all my cat loving friends they NEED to get one for their cats!  I also think with the weather being so hot, it's quite a bit cooler for them to lay on this type of surface.  The lounger itself is very well made, very sturdy and will hold up for a long, long time!!!  Just add catnip and your kitties will love you for getting this item for them!",5
"I couldn't get this thing to get shedding fur out of my dog to save my soul. You look at my dog funny and his fur falls out, but this thing couldn't get the job done no matter how much elbow grease I applied.",1
Have used Bobbi Panter Gorgeous Dog and Snarly Dog before and these are exceptional products for Shih Tzu or other long haored dogs and they also have a wonderful smell for your pup.,5
My dog loves these!,5
"Running this 200 watt heater in a 40 gallon breeder tank, which is filled to about 30 gallons. I have the heater placed horizontally so that it's fully submerged and creates a convection. My water temperature is consistent, at 80 degrees which I set it at. I do notice it tends to increase right around +2 degrees but it's really not an issue for me. Might be a little more concerning if I had fish but turtles aren't quite as sensitive to it.",5
"I took a couple of stars off because this thing advertises that it is leak-proof and it is certainly not.  It actually leaks a lot. I keep mine in a plastic bag because of that and I can't imagine trying to use it without one, unless you waited till you went out to fill it with any water.  I keep it in the car so that i have water for the pup when we are out and about, and then it's there for hikes too.  It does work, and I can't say that I've found anything better but it's not quite as good as i had hoped because of the leaking issue.  Also the water just sits in the trough and there is no way to get it back in the bottle, say you were in the car and wanted to give him a drink but he didn't drink it all.  You have to dump the remainder out.  That's fine when out hiking/walking but not as good as in a car.  So it's not a bad product but do be aware of its shortcomings when you decide if that's the product for you.",3
"Not dust or tracking free as indicated.
Scent is ok, and no smell for the 7 days assuming cat functions correctly and buries her business properly.

Works for me so I stick with it.",4
"My cats absolutely love these treats.  They are their very favorite treats, along with the Whiskas Temptations Milk Flavored Treats.  They are soft on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.  Two of our cats are very picky, and when we get these treats out they go nuts.  It's hard to find stuff they will eat, but every single flavor we've tried of Whiskas Temptations is a win for our kitties.  Buy them, your cats will thank you!",5
"PERFECT for kitties that like to ""stand"" while doing their business.  I took off the front shield because we don't have dogs and the kitties liked it much better.  No leaks and easy to clean!  Very roomy for a couple of my larger kitties.  Low enough in front so elderly kitties have no problem climbing in.  Also looks nice and slightly concealed.",5
Great price and fast ship,5
"Came in one piece, and looks great in my tank. Very satisfied.",5
"Love it, love it, love it.  This is not only beautiful but durable and so well made. Thank you to a great seller and to Amazon as well.  I highly recommend this collar to every pet owner out there.  There are no heavy metal clasps or buckles to add weight to this lightweight mesh harness -- and I love the comfort my dog obviously feels while wearing the Puppia RiteFit Harness -- and it fits like a custom-made harness.",5
Works as excepted.,4
This is awesome to keep rabbits in good health.,5
Perfect for puppies 8 - 16 wks,5
"My daughter's cat loves these chunks of reconstituted yumminess. This is the first time I've tried a freeze dried cat food and I have to say it is a great option. The bag is light and the chunks, when reconstituted, make a softer, hearty meal. It saves on shipping costs and storage bulk. Very nice!",5
Works great smells good,5
"Great quality! Not flimsy at all and my dog loved it! We are moving to NY and even though my dog has a big fur coat, I felt she might benefit from a super adorable sweater too during the winter months. Love it and will be looking at their other items!",5
"I had this doggie door installed in a steel door so it had to be installed about 3-4 inches from the ground to not cut through a steel bar at the bottom of the door.  My older dog is a Chihuahua with short legs and she doesn't get around too well from arthritis so it is too much of an effort for her to get up and through since it's thicker than most doggie doors (about 3 inches of depth to accommodate 2 flaps).  She wants no parts of it, but this issue is with the dog since I've tried to get her through other doggie doors which are lower to the ground and she does not like to push the flap with her head.  I removed one of the flaps to start and my younger dog goes in and out with no problems....she loves it!  The flap is very sturdy and always connects back to the magnet after the dog goes through.  I connected the 2nd flap now that cold weather is here and no problems for the dog to push through 2 flaps.  I will say that on a REALLY windy day, both flaps will occasionally fly open with the wind and stay that way for a few seconds until the wind dies down again, but I'm sure that would happen with any doggie door. I can at least close it down during the night so the wind can not blow through but have to deal with it during the day when the dog needs access.",5
"My puppy recently had stitches on his paw pad. He's a large puppy with big feet but i still measured it just to make sure it was in range of what the size chart was, and it was so I proceeded to buy an xl which is the biggest size they had. The bandages came inside out and are meant to be reversed and then placed on the paw. But even being as gentle as I could, there was no way I could reverse the material without it tearing and stretching out. There was no way to get it on without irritating the stitches he had on his foot so I decided not to put him through any more pain. For large to extra large dogs, i'd seek a different type of bandage that is easier to manage. For reference on size of my dog he is 1 year old 100 pound akita",2

Clean look also is accurate and professional looking,5
"My dwarf rabbit loved this thing. He tossed it around and gnawed on it, as bunnies are apt to do. It lasted, mostly intact, for a week or so. Even after he chewed it enough to where it fell apart, he would still occasionally find pieces laying around and eat them.

Pros: good size for a rabbit to play with, safe for him to eat, solid enough to gnaw on

Cons: has a peanut inside for a rattling sound, but I removed it after my bun chewed a hole in the side since I didn't want him to eat the nut",5
"This toy keeps my puppy entertained for quite some time.  She loves to pull the sheep out of their little house and then squeak them.  We need to at least pull the sheep's head out of the hole so she can get it out.  She has managed to shred one or two, but they held up for quite a while.",5

This is a healthy chew treat for my dogs.  It keeps them busy.  The price is also a plus as locally the cost is much higher,5
perfect height for my small dogs and so pretty. beautiful set.,5
"I am a self-professed ""dog food snob"" because I always pick apart the ingredients when shopping for pet food and snacks. I only give my pets healthy food and treats - they actually eat better than I do. I seldom feed beef to my pets and prefer fish and lamb-based products. I don't buy anything with artificial ingredients and have resigned to only buying American-made products.  We use Crunchy Puffs for a light and crunchy snack, or as a treat for a job well done. My dog LOVES them and I like the fact that they are healthy, with limited ingredients and *MADE IN USA*.

As with previous review, I stumbled on them at Costco, but you can't always count on Costco carrying what you want all the time, so I'm so happy to find them on Amazon!

Great product!",5
"I wouldn't trust this for a 5 gallon DWC.. Its enough air flow if your using all the air nozzles but if one of the air stones gets clogged, you could have a mildew problem on your hands... I paired this with an additional Hydrofarm pump and it worked great.",3
"These were a lot of fun to play with. They made a nice loud squeak, but they didn't last long. My dog pierced them pretty fast, and once they're pierced, they don't squeak anymore. I have a 75-lb German shepherd/Labrador, so your smaller dog might not destroy them so fast.",3
did not work did not work.. the gardener thinks its some fertilizer stake or something so leaves it in the ground. even the squireels don't like it,1
My dogs like them as if a treat. Seems they have an easier time getting around since I've given them these VetIQ chews. Both of my dogs have bad arthritis and have a lot of pain. I would recommend them for anyone.,3
"My cats hate this stuff.  They won't use the box... not sure why but think maybe it is the scent, it's kinda flowery.  Don't much care for it myself but LOVE the lightweight aspect.  I'm a bit bummed.  Dang cats...",3
My puppy was at the vet with a bacterial infection within 24 hours of using these. This is NOT a product of the USA and my vet wasn't supportive of us using it.,1

"Very effective. Kitty loves it and uses it as a day bed! Only  problem I find is that it could be wider. My kitty is slim and""not too wide""but there's really nottoo much room to accomodate.  I had to buy two and put them together to fix the problem. Could the measurements be increased to take care of this? Otherwise it is a great item. Thank you",4
My dog liked them but they literally lasted her 2 minutes. She is a 20lb dog.,3
Just what I needed.,4
"This is a very nice bag and fits two bottles of water and his collapsible bowl easily. I use it for his morning walks when it's cooler outside to give him a little extra work - my dog, Teddy, is a working breed - and It's holding up very well even though he ends up rubbing it against bushes almost every day. There was a small adjustment period for fitting and getting him used to it, but he's fine with it now.

CON: If your dog has anything but very short fur, you will have to be very careful about getting their fur caught in the clips. There are three clips: one small one in front that's at about the base of the chest, one behind the front legs, and one at about the bottom of the rib cage. My dog has medium length fur (it will be long once it's fully gown back) and I have to be extra careful every time I put it on him that I don't catch his fur in the clips. Because of this, I don't actually have it fitted firmly against him. The first time I put it on him, he growled (very unusual for him) and I realized it was because his fur got caught in the clip and was pulling on his skin. Ouch! So I take the extra time to put it on slowly and carefully. A solution could be some extended fabric behind the receptive clip to both help keep long fur way from the connecting point and protect the body from the clips rubbing against them.",4
Not good..very big in the neck..slips down very baggy tossed it out.,1
Over 6 months it has worked flawlessly while attached to the neck of a smell crazy rabbit crazy lab with the strength of 10 bison. It really is smooth and has never had a hang up or become twisted. Accidentally left it out in the rain a few times with no signs of it being worse for the wear.  It has a lock so that you can use it as a normal set length leash as well. The weight is pretty much a non factor as it is lighter than you might expect.,5
These Doggles are so cool.  They fit my dog perfectly and she is pretty good about keeping them on.  We do lots of offroading and her little eyes get so full of dirt.  These cut down the dust tremendously.  The tinted lenses are also a plus as we live in Arizona and the sun is bright here all the time.,5
"My beardie hated this harness, it's decent quality, but hard to put on a squirmy bearded dragon who doesn't want it on...",4
"Cats really like it.  Not too much of a challenge to assemble, but the instructions would not be clear to someone who does not typically put things together.",5
I just don't give more stars because it didn't work on my deaf dog... so for training a normal hearing dog I think it will be fine.,3
This is a very rugged ball. I have a lab who destroys most balls. Not this one!,5
Beautiful bows! I love the quality. Will definitely buy more in other colors. The elastic band is very strong. It's doesn't break after multiple uses.,5
"bought this exact product from Target for my 57lb Labrador retriever, we had recently taken in a 4 week old stray kitten who brought fleas into the house and while they hadn't come in contact with each other yet, we wanted to get our dog on some flea treatment just in case they tried to jump onto her. It's worked wonderfully! We haven't found a single flea on her yet, she isn't scratching like she has them and we've been running the flea comb through her fur and haven't found any signs of them! The kitten doesn't get put on his flea treatment until he is 6 weeks old, so for now he takes half of a capstar pill every week to get rid of the live fleas, and our vet is putting him on Revolution here next week :)",5
Kitty likes it,5
Chihuahua doesn't like it but he is extremely spoiled to fresh meat. But the cats love it even with their food out also.,4
"Cats... they go crazy with this. We have to make sure they don't overplay...
One of our kitties started to pant after some intense play with it. That's when we knew that one of our kitties just doesn't know when to stop playing when it comes to his favorite toy :D",5
EXCELLENT I LOVE IT,5
Good basic comb!,4
"Great Cover Fits well.
Bought this cover to protect the back leather seat in our 2003 Acura MDX SUV. We have twoYellow lab mix dogs each weighing about 65#. They were causing minor wear on the seat but mostly getting them dirty and full of dog hair, requiring a lot of cleaning before we could take any passengers in the back seat.
The cover looks good, is well made and fits almost perfectly. When we have riders in the back, simply remove the cover an are good to go. Have cleaned it once with mild soap and a soft brush and it's good as new. Can recommend thus product.",5
"I bought two for my rescued babies and they were gorgeous! Pictures do not do justice! Super fast shipping and delivery much sooner than was estimated. Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 are as follows:

1. Font on front was plain, not fancy
2. They don't feel engraved. More like printed on so I'm a bit worried about rubbing off.",4
This was a gift for my friend and she tells me that her cats love it.,5
"My dog loves these, he is not a beggar or drool er, but man when he knows these are around he sits over by the treat bowl.  Keep em coming.",5
They were exactly as expected and fit the collar that I have.,5
"I got this for my 10 gallon betta tank. It works perfectly! The bubbling sound is kinda loud, but that is the only ""bad"" thing about it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a smaller tank, especially for a betta with sensitive fins.",5
i got this to keep from having little poop particles all over the place after i was done and it works great.,5
"Nice scissors, but didn't come with the grooming book.",4
"Easy to use, and a good supply!",4
"Looks great, and the quality is good. After several months of constant wear, there's no fraying. I like that the buckle is substantial and feels like it'll last forever. My dog loves to put this on, I might add. We also have the matching leash. I would buy again.",5
"the cats took to it immediately, liked it better than the wysong vegan kibble",5
This item is very thick and plush.  Size dimensions are accurate for the size of the crate.  I have machine washed it several times and it is holding up very well.,5
My cats love it and it's a good size for my needs.,5
"Our dog loves these! I'm glad they come in groups of three, because she'll usually tear out the squeaker/rip off the fuzz in a week.",5
"I live in Maryland where Lyme is present. I always thought I was taking great care of my labs. They had their Lyme vaccine, and Frontline. Yeah, right! One of my labs collapsed one day with swollen legs. He was diagnosed with Lyme and kidney failure. He looked and acted healthy until then. I had to put him to sleep. He was 3 years old. Nobody ever told me that Frontline was not good enough. It takes Frontline up to 48 hours to kill a tick which can infect a dog in 24 hours.
I tried to understand what happened, and I realized that they were much better products than Frontline like Parastar Plus which kills a tick within an hour. My dog would still be alive if I had known about it. Great product!
FYI deer carry ticks like most of the wild animals, but the guilty ones to give Lyme to a tick are the mice. If you have mice, get rid of them. There are ultra sound plug ins which work really well to get rid of them. My two cents.",5
"I love this betta food. The pellets are tiny, so even my smallest betta can get them down.",5
"Soil is tiny and my shrimps love to play with them, however, it is not very suitable for aquarium plants since granules are tiny and does not hold plants tightly.
In conclusion, it is very good for shrimps, but not very good for planting aquarium plants.",4
Very nice stroller and I love the YELLOW color!  Excellent customer service as well.  Consider this for your pet as a fun outing/field trip!,5
great bones for my little dogs.  There is a slight odor but nothing we can't live with.,5
"I was using the Arm & Hammer litter mat since that was all I could find in local stores. I wasn't happy with it since it was hard to sweep. Also my two chihuahua puppies were able to easily tear up small pieces of it  whenever they got near.
When I  saw this mat, my first thought was that I would never pay almost 30. for a litter mat. I'm so glad i changed my mind! This mat is tough, easy to clean and you can step on it.
My cats have no problem with it. It fits my extra  large litter box. It is easy to sweep and best of all, my puppies can't  chew it.  If your looking for a high quality, easy to clean mat, this is the product for you.",5
"Our teacup poodle, Jet, is an old boy and he seems to do well on this food. Unfortunately the cats love it too. Lol. It tricky keeping them out of it.",5
"Extremely handy, especially with the different options for different connections.  Love not having to deal with buckets anymore!",5
"My girl loved these. The texture on them is like those cheese balls in the huge container. Very lightweight, rotisserie chicken flavor, and they smell good too! They're made with all natural ingredients. This is a 4oz bag with 100 treats in it.",5
My new Whisper EX30 doesn't come with a spot for the time replacement strips anymore and apparently the refills don't come with the strips anymore either - I know it was a gimmick - but I loved to have them as a remind - still great carbon filters for the Whisper EX's that I love - just not having the replacement time strips anymore are the reason for the loss of a star.,4
I need to purchase another one and hope it lasts longer than the first one.  Somehow my 18 month old pup twisted the end of this seat belt until it snapped.  Much better than using a cage.  Will post further info on the 2nd one after I order and use it.,4
"This is very shallow, small, and cheaply made.  This is good for a cat and less than 5lb dog.  The good thing is that I can wash it easily.",2
Our little dog loves this.  He carries it all over the house and sleeps with it.,5
"Love this collar, it very bright so you can see it on the darkest of nights. It's great that it is rechargeable because I use every night when the dog goes out. I have used this type of collar before but the battery doesn't last long and they were not rechargeable.",5
3 years later and still great!,5
Dogs would not eat these,1
Its Carbon. Works fine. Its is small pellets.,5
Very cute sweatshirt for my little guy!  It's not ideal for him walking around or running but he looks adorable in it. :),5
"I bought this carrier for my 11 week old  2.5 lb. chihuahua it's big for her but I wanted something that will work for her as she grows. It has 3 really big compartments to carry my personal items plus her toys, retractable leash, treats, small water dish and waste bags and still have room for more. I like the fact that I can carry everything in one bag and I don't have to also carry a purse. It is very well made and looks great. I'm very, very happy with it :)",5
My pup loves her new bed..  fits in the crate perfectly and the quality is really good..  very soft material,5
So far it works good,5
"My dogs really lie these, the old ones and the young ones.",5
"Wish this item didn't have some of the ridges on the bottom, because sometimes it causes clumps to break up while scooping. I do really like the top shield, it really helps catch the extra litter from being spread all over the room.",3
"Great product, heavy duty enough for crazy little kittens. Easy to clean. Zippered bottom and top are easy to take on/off. Can open the top and let mom come and go while kittens confined. They can climb the mesh buy the top ends in canvas, so they can't get out. : )",5
This product is light and easy to use especially for woman! I am on day 4 with it and my dogs will use it to come out of the vehicle. Still needs work with using it to go in the vehicle. I would definitely recommend this to everyone! Easy to use and its pretty strong! It can hold 140# of me and yes I did try it!!! :),5
"give this to my cats and to my dogs for flea issues, havn't seen too many fleas since they have been on this",4
5 stars to the company; 3 stars for my cat really just sitting on it...,4
My cats wouldn't touch it.  They didn't even recognize it as edible.  So it might work like a charm; I'll never know.,1
Nice litter box for cats who don't squat all the way and for cats who make a mess with the litter. Cats really like this one.,5
"I got this as a gift or i would request a refund.  This ate through batteries and then broke in a 2 month period, i used it about 15 mins 4 times a week.  It is a clever product,  but wish it lasted.",2
Very will liked by our dog and easy to use in the snow,5
What more can I say- if the dog doesn't like it you won't buy it again.  I use the Little Champions ground meal all the time and she likes those - but not the grilled.,2
so so,3
"We are newbies to the world of Ferrets and did LOTS of research before getting into something we couldn't handle!! That said there are conflicting tidbits about how often to bath the little stinkers (said affectionately). Our cage is spot cleaned every morning and again in the evening, with a major top to bottom clean every other week. Well, we found that bathing Him when we do our big clean up every other week is perfect. And this soap is nice. It does not make him itchy and the smell is very nice AND he gets super fluffy and soft. A little goes a long way. We highly recommend this stuff",5
"This is a fantastic product for any dogs who are in not great health, and could benefit from a protein supplement.  Seacure has only one ingredient - predigested, concentrate cod fish.  It was developed over 40 years ago as a way to provide immediate nutrition to malnourished children in third world countries.  Humans and animals who have experienced starvation and serious malnourishment cannot simply start eating regular food, as their bodies will reject it.  That is why Seacure was formulated to be predigested, which means that it does not tax the kidneys like other protein supplements can.

My dog is older with several health conditions and a restricted diet due to those.  He has lost weight in the last year due to his health conditions, and became underweight.  For his health to improve however, he needed to gain weight.  A friend of mine whose dog has EPI told me about this product.  It is used by many EPI dog parents because those dogs cannot properly digest food, and thus are often very underweight, and cannot get healthy because they can't get the energy and nutrients from food like they need.  Seacure is great because it is predigested, so EPI dogs don't need to digest it, and thus they can fully utilize the nutrition and protein.  I started adding a little Seacure to my dog's food about 6 months ago, and it has helped him gain weight and become healthier.

The product itself comes in a white, twist off container.  The powder inside is a mustard yellow/brown type color, and smells distinctively like fish.  My dogs go crazy when I open the container because they smell it, but some people dislike the smell.  The best way to reduce the scent of the product is to keep it in the fridge, as that really cuts down on the scent.  The recommended serving size is one scoop per 10 pounds of body weight.  The scoop is included in the jar and measures 1/4 a teaspoon.  So a very small amount of this product goes a long way.  One container lasted me several months, and I am now on the second container.

You may think the price seems expensive for a small jar, but it contains concentrated, high quality protein.  To get the same amount from fresh fish, for example, you would likely need 10+ pounds of fish, which would easily cost more than this jar.  Plus with Seacure, the fish is already predigested, dried, and concentrated for you.

I highly recommend Seacure for anyone whose dog needs a protein supplement, needs to gain weight, or just needs some extra pep in their step.  I am not saying this is a miracle product that can cure every condition, but it is a universally beneficial supplement, being high quality, low fat, white fish.",5
"Right now i am using this box as a cat bed, but it is a good size.",5
My cats love this food. I've bought it for years and it does not upset their stomachs. It smells almost good enough to eat!,5
"Tennis balls for a German Shepherd are worthless.
 Get the rubber  Chuck n It ball  that Chuck it  makes and have a blast.
 This toy is a sought after one in this house.
 Great exercise tool.
 But, confused  the tennis ball for a big and Drivey dog as mine is because  in just one throw the tennis ball  is destroyed by my dogs powered up jaw.",5
"I bought this cage for two zebra finches. The cage seems a bit large for just the two small birds, but we may get another pair. The instructions to put the cage together stated it would take approximately 30 minutes to assemble, and it took me a bit longer. The ""snap in"" parts were tough, to the point where I was worried I was going to break something. The birds seem to enjoy it, however the wire spacing for the bottom grate seems a bit large for them. Each food dish has a small piece of plastic overhead to keep droppings out of the food and water, which is nice. The clear plastic enclosure around the bottom is great for keeping seed and loose feathers inside the cage and off my floor. Over all, I would reccomend this cage -- it keeps the mess down and is visually appealing to look at.",5
It works well but you have to change the pads a lot (or at least for my cats I do). I wish the pads weren't so expensive! $10 for 4 pads is seems a bit high for how many times I need to switch them out. Other than that clean up hasn't ever been easier!,4
Read the reviews and realized my beta was being deprived...bad beta owner!!!! I was a little skeptical but that subsided quickly and I'm glad I got it now my beta isn't deprived and I'm a good beta owner lol :),5
Cat loves these. Crunchy but not too hard.  I often give these to cat after she eats fish/tuna to help freshen breath since I don't like the smell of tuna. She always comes running when she sees the container of these out.,5
I have a 18lbd Dauschund and he just loves these. He has terrible breath and these help. They don't make the stink go away 100% but its better than nothing!,4
"It has an odd smell to it and my dog sat on it for the first time, smelled it and peed on it.  Now she just gets on it to pee.",3
This is a wonderful toy for an active cat.  My Achmed has been terrorizing my house since rescuing him two weeks ago.  Finally a toy he loves and played with for hours.  He is finally wore out and napping!,5
My dog loves this item SO MUCH!!!  Probably because it is so squishy and squeaks well.  Highly recommended for using it rather than the regular balls.,5
oh my gosh the cutest thing ever! Super cheap and nice quality!,5
"One cat has used it once.  It takes time for both of my cats to adapt to anything.  so, here's hoping it will produce the desired effect.",4
My dogs' love these!,5
SO cute. i just wish it would have shipped a little faster.,4
"When our cat is happy, so our we. Great product for our wonderful kitty",5
"Unfortunately this power filter died 2 weeks after purchase and use.  Bought the tetra whisper power filter instead.  Best luck with tetra and no luck with first try at Aqueon.  If you don't mind putting together the filters (which is a cinch), buy the tetra because they are half the price versus the aqueon.",1
"This is awesome!!! Collects the loose hairs! Oh and by the way, my dogs love it! They will wait in line...",5
I buy this on amazon because its cheaper than petsmart and petco and best of all I do not have to drive anywhere. My lab and border collie usually destroy them in about 2 hours.,5
"Fits my 80 lb pitty, Nikkia perfectly! Make sure to measure your pups and consult the measuring chart when ordering.",5
"I kept hearing wonderful things about this scratching post but never took the plunge. The favorite cat tree was starting to look raggedy though so I figured it was time to give my four cats something else to focus their frustrations on. After the first 2 or 3 days I was seriously worried I had bombed. The cat I thought would fall in love with it wouldn't even go near it. Day 4, Cat One began to use it. After another week or so Cat Two came on board. Few months later, Cat Three. Almost nine months later, the cat I thought would claim it still hasn't used it, so I guess it's the fact that it's carpet style, and not sisal, is what's stopping him from using the post. It's holding up really well from near daily use by the three of them, and still looks new - can't beat that for the price. It does move a little when being attacked at but the floor that it's on in my kitchen area is uneven so that combined with the fact that one that Cat One is pushing 22 pounds... well... Anyways, I'd happily buy this one again. And again.",5
I am very pleased with these. I use a liner and then put the box in a plasm litter box. Works great!,5
Good quality & sturdy!,4
My Cockatiel won't eat it.,2
Love this gate...just don't hook it in too tight if you actually want the seats (to which it is attached) to continue to move independently.  :),5
They didn't last long!!!  Dogs love these and always want more and more and more!!!!!  Healthy treats.  Recommend highly for all dogs.,5
"I liked the idea of the mesh - more breathable for the dog.  However, the materials/stitching is weak.  My little 18 lb min pin ripped it in the first week of pulling me around in it.  I sewed it by hand to repair it, and got a little more use out of it, but overall the quality of materials is poor.  Might be OK if you have a little, gentle fru-fru dog.  If you have a little ball of fire (like my min pin or pug), it cannot stand up to their pulling.",1
"Horribly dangerous and doesn't retract well.  My child was the unfortunate recipient of a horrible rope burn when our dog walked around him while on this leash.  Also got wrapped around the dog's leg and caused her to limp in pain. I tried to just be more careful, but many other dog owners at the park informed me of the awful injuries they've seen with rope leashes.  Please consider a nylon ribbon style leash instead!

Other than being dangerous, the retraction on this is awful.
Returning today.",2
the litter stays in the box when the cats swish it around.,5
"My dogs love the tough turtle.  They have finally destroyed all the baby turtles, but it took a while.  I now stuff the momma turtle with other squeaky toys.  Once the momma turtle is done, I will definitely buy a new one.",5
My cats really didn't like the smell or the flavor of these,3
okay,3
"This pump is awesome for the money.  I bought this as a replacement pump for my cadlights 22 gallon all in one tank with overflow.  This pump is not only cheap in price and great on performance, but it came with a ton of accessories and different heads for different mounting and usage purposes.  I'm very satisfied and its been running great for months.  Only question is about aquatops warranty, guess ill find out one day.  I did have one of their heaters go out after a power failure but the pump still works fine off that same plug.  I would recommend this product.",5
seems to work well  may have to use twice though,5
Mia is loving her groomer!,5
"By the way my 122-lb Akbash/Pyrenees mix gobbles these up, I'd say they are 5 star. They don't seem to smell as bad as most dog treats...the whiff of fake meat when you open a bag of dog treats can be overwhelming, unless you're a dog I guess. I get these on subscribe and save and always have them in the house for the many dogs that come and go in our home.",5
"This sweater is light weight, perfect for spring.  We were very satisfied.  Not for deep-chested dogs.",5
dog liked them,4
It is so necessary for a caged bird to have minerals in their diets. He loves this big mineral block,5
cute balls!!! I picked them since they were too big for my 8 month old to choke on. Kitty loves them,5
cats love it!,5
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
Great variety & shades of each color. Great coverage & can build on color to make it as dark and vibrant as you want. Great price.",5
"Reef salt soooo salty, even your enemies will use this to dish it out.",5
I love it but Pinky does not...,5
I love the stylishness of this and like that the silver bowl comes out of the plastic base.... just know this is a very small bowl and is probably best for a cat not a 10 lb dog.,4
"We previously used the competitor product, but tried switching after all four of our animals got fleas.  I can't tell you how much I hate fleas: we struggled for a month and a half to clear the house of them.  Each time we thought we were in the clear one of the dogs or cats would start scratching and we started all over.  The final treatment that ended up working included the switch from Frontline to Advantix and we won't go back: no fleas in the carpet or ticks in the bedding.",5
Love it!,5
Little guy loved this! Got it in red!,5
This stuff works (I have three cats).  You basically just have to scoop poop and stir it up a bit to mix the wet crystals with the dry ones.  I am very fussy with scented anything as well and found the scent to be light and fresh if you even noticed it.  Great stuff!,4
It was as described...easy for 2 people to assemble.,5
CCD t,5
My finicky cat loves these. Will be ordering more.,5
The shoes was cute I got those so my dog feet would not get muddy when he want out but he sat outside and pulled them off,5
Perfect,5
"It's cat litter. The packaging is cute. My cat uses it. If it retained odor better, I would add a star.",4
"Great price - bulbs do not last too long, maybe the shipping?",3
"Easy assembly my foot! You have to be a contortionist to get this assembled correctly. I will keep trying for awhile and then I may have to send it back. I chose this one because it says no tools required. So far my assembly attempts are coming out warped. I can get the screws in, but the bed is warped with one side sticking up in the air.",1
"My dogs have used this since they were 11. They got a little tired of the same ole same ole but we pretty much stuck to this brand. I have lost one at 17 1/2 but the 15 yr old is going strong. Wish maybe it came in flavors. Chicken one time, Beef the next. BUT would recommend. Both my senior dogs were between 10 & 20 lbs. The bites are tiny for aging teeth as well.",5
Wrong size,1
My 7 year old mini-dachshund loves her KONG!,5
"I love the list of ingredients on this product. Dogs that eat this type of diet poop less (because it's not a lot of fillers bulking up their digestive tract), and have more energy and better overall health. The kibbles are small enough for puppies and even almost any size mini breed. Our 2-month-old yellow lab went right for it. The nutritional profile of 28:15 protein-to-fat is almost identical to what our breeder recommended for our dog (28:16), so that's a real plus, and the mark of a high-quality feed. No added colors, silly shapes, or other nonsense. Highly recommended.

My one beef with this product is the packaging. It comes with a ziploc top that slides open to reveal a thick plastic sheet with no perforation or other way of separating so that it can open. There were no instructions on the bag for how to correctly open it to retain the reclose feature, and my very, very careful attempt to slice it with a knife left me with a ruined bag that can't be sealed. Either my bag was faulty, or they seriously need to redesign their closure. I deducted 1 star for this reason alone, since keeping the product fresh and secure is a priority.

Other than that, I give this an unreserved endorsement.",4
If you are using Pet Tinic I recommend Pet-Tabs Iron Plus.  It is much more cost effective for the same ingredients.,5
my puppy loves it,5
"As any cat owner knows the most difficult thing with a cat is clipping the nails without incident.  I had owned a similar cat grooming bag and it finally just died. This is very sturdy and I really like the zipper features for ease of getting to paws.  This sack, as in the past, provides comfort for my furkids making it a little less traumatic event.",5
My guinea pigs love this product very much:),5
good,5
good price and my dog love it!,5
Exactly what I was looking for.  Thank youy,5
"Okay, this is kind of hard to review on all points since my dog doesn't speak English but I will review what I can:

First, he asked for another after he had the first. This is the biggest thing -- it obviously tastes good to him. If it didn't it wouldn't matter how good for him it was.

Second, I very much appreciate the joint health supplements in this. I've been noticing my dog (since he is now in his 11 year of life...born in 2005  so almost his 12th year of life) isn't so peppy as he used to be. I think there are days he hurts. So I am thankful I can give him these supplements.

Third, the dosage is right on the package according to weight. And it also says you can double the dosage for the first two or three weeks if your dog is obviously hurting a lot. There are 45 soft chews in the package. So for a dog 60 pounds and below this package will last a month and a half. I'm not sure what it costs but if it makes my dog feel better, buying one of these bags every six weeks is a good investment into his health.",5
I have 4 and I'm always using them! They work great and are wayyyy better than a breeder nets because they promote circulation in the breeder box! A must have for breeders! Also great for isolating injured fish!,5
great stuff,5
We are a multi-cat household; one of our cats has food allergies and another is very fussy. This food works for everyone--the cats love it and it doesn't trigger allergies.,5
My fish don't jump out anymore,5
durable and tough.,5
"While my pups do love this food and have been consuming it for about four months, I have noticed some things that worry me since they've been eating it. Unfortunately their ""potty"" has taken on more of an odor and is much less solid than before. There have been a few times where they've had full out diarrhea or have thrown up the food completely. I do not want to blame the food completely for these things happening, because I truly do not know that the food is 100% causing it. However, none of this happened when they were eating Beneful, which is supposed to be must less healthy than this food. Therefore, I will be switching them to a grain-free dry food and away from this Rachel Ray brand. While I wouldn't necessarily steer others away from using this brand, I will not be recommending it to others due to my experiences.",3
"The cats love this cat food, so I keep on ordering it.  Good cat food without bi products is the only way to go.",5
"Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to finally use this collar (I purchased it 8 months ago) as my dog was recovering from surgery.  He seems to tolerate this collar much better than the traditional hard plastic ones.  He hasn't once tried to escape out of it.  I did find out purely by accident, however, that the collar will slip right off of his head, so he COULD escape from it without too much effort.  You need to make sure that you string your dog's regular collar through the heavy-duty nylon web strips on the E-collar, and that will prevent it from slipping off.

Personally, I don't see how my dog can be comfortable while he's lying down; i.e. although the collar makes a nice soft pillow, his neck is stretched in what I would think is an awkward position.  There's also really no smooth surface on the collar to rest his face (on one end is the velcro flap and on the other end are three strips of heavy-duty nylon webbing).  Nevertheless, he is content and peaceful when sleeping with the collar on (see photo).

I remove the collar when I feed my dog (providing I can keep an eye on him), but I don't feel it's necessary to do so.  I merely do it to give him a break.  I'm positive he could eat normally out of his bowl while wearing the collar.  Using the water dish with a traditional E-collar was always an adventure, sometimes with as much water ending up inside the collar (and on the floor) than in the dog's mouth, but my dog has no problems drinking out of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/K-H-CleanFlow-Watering-Bowl/dp/B008KG6WGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">K&H CleanFlow Watering Bowl</a>&nbsp;with this collar.  I attribute that to the fact that the inflatable collar is ring-shaped (like a life preserver) versus cone-shaped, and therefore his head is free instead of tucked inside a cone.  I'm sure that has to be less claustrophobic for the dog, too, with unimpeded peripheral vision and nothing surrounding his head/face; and less claustrophobic can only lead to a calmer demeanor during recovery, rather than the dog feeling like he's being punished.

The outer shell is removable from the inner air bladder for cleaning.  I don't think that's ""really"" necessary--it's easy to wipe down with plain water and a paper towel as is--but it's a nice feature.

I've read another review where the owner claims the dog bit through the collar to deflate it.  My dog hasn't made such an attempt, but I'd be surprised if he could even get his mouth around it to do so.  I have to call shenanigans on anyone who claims their dog bit through the collar... at least while wearing it.  Now if the dog attacks it once it's removed, well, that's an entirely different story; and in that case I call ""operator error"" for letting the dog have access to it rather than blaming the collar.

On the down side, I've noticed two problems with this inflatable collar.  The first is more of an inconvenience than a problem, but it's really a pain trying to use this thing with a leash.  Recall that I said the dog's regular collar should be fed through the nylon strips on the inflatable collar.  That makes it difficult to access the D-ring on the regular collar to attach & remove the leash, especially since the webbing is loose so the regular collar shifts position.  Also, if you need to tug on the leash for any reason, the leash pulls the inflatable collar over the dog's face.

The other more serious problem is that my dog got his front paw stuck in one of the nylon web loops.  Nothing sends a dog into a panic more than having one of his paws captive, not to mention the 3-legged hop while trying to recover from surgery.  Honestly, I don't know how he was even able to get the paw stuck in the webbing... but ""how"" is irrelevant, I guess.  What matters is that it happened at all, and it wasn't easy to reverse.

In conclusion, like most people I was a little... well... I don't want to say skeptical... but in spite of being open-minded about it I was still a little disbelieving about whether an inflatable collar was a legitimate alternative or a stupid gimmick.  In the end, having used it for a couple weeks now, I have to say that it's an improvement over the traditional plastic E-collar.  My dog doesn't fuss around in it, doesn't paw at it trying to remove it, seems to sleep comfortably in it, can eat & drink normally in it, has unimpeded vision (except to the rear, of course), and the collar has done a wonderful job of denying my dog's mouth any access to the post-op stitches (chest & hind leg) or IV insertion site (front arm).  The problem with the trapped paw is a definite concern, so the dog requires a higher level of watchfulness with this collar over a traditional E-collar.  My only other concern about the collar at this point is long-term storage; and by that I mean hygienically.  You inflate the collar by blowing warm, moist air into it.  Does that become a breeding ground for mold & bacteria while it sits on the shelf (or even during use while the dog is wearing it)?  I plan to run a mild solution of bleach through it before storage, just as a precaution.  Overall I'm pretty happy with the collar, though.",4
"I've been using these containers for about six months, and am happy with them.  I love the wheels - so convenient!  The large container will hold 30 lbs. of my dogs' food.  (The kibble size is relatively small.  May not hold as many pounds of a bigger kibble.)  I use the small container for storing bird seed.",5
"This always succeeds even on off days, the tiny bits don't offend and tasty for both!",5
My daughter's cat loves this toy. He plays with it for hours. The only negative is that he can get the balls out and so she has to only let him play with it when she is watching him so she can put them back in without him tearing them up. It has an on/off switch so she can regulate it. We just wish the balls did come out so easily otherwise it would have been five stars.,4
"My puppy loves these.  I have multiple purchases. My dod is 34Lbs and a strong chewer,  these last quite awhile.",5
Don't know why i even bought this. My pups absolutely hate wearing collars especially with a leash.. They find a way to work themselves right out of it. Plus collars actually choke them somewhat. At least that's what I was told.,2
"This is the ball of choice for my 30# dog.  Although 14 years old, she pushes her ball everyday.  You can regulate the amount of kibbles it dispenses.  She is not a chewer so that has not been an issue with this ball.  The first ball lasted for over a year of daily use.  Keeps my old girl busy!",5
very happy with this pet barrier!,5
"Works as advertised. So easy to clean. Hum doesn't bother my cat and he is easily spooked. It did take him a few days to drink from it, but now he loves it.",5
Does the job. Easy to install,5
We have a puppy - we go through this stuff like crazy. This is by far the best cleaner for pets - even if you don't have a puppy. It works miracles on stains and eliminates pet odor like it was never there.,5
"Nice sturdy crate for the price, on a lightning deal.  The door is much heavier gauge than another brand for about the same price that I bought at Fleet Farm.",5
"My cat is very fond of this.  She loves it for a while, then ignores it, so I put it away for a month or two, and then she loves it again, attacking it and kicking the heck out of it.",4
Love it our little dog has back issue and this has worked really well for her would buy again,5
Great item.. shipped quick.,5
Keeps my sun conure busy and quiet for awhile.,5
"Ordered the large but got small, waste of money.",1
This makes emptying the litter box not so bad. My husband does not mind helping me scoop out the litter anymore.,5
"My dogs love this food, and I've been using it for several years now.",5
Reilliy loves these Dentastix Deep Cleaning - Well worth the price - fast shipping.,5
"When calibrated correctly by starting at the least sensitive setting and gently blowing a brief puff of air over the sound sensor hole on the electrode side of the unit, and then sequentially increasing the sensitivity one increment (button push per puff of air) at a time-- this device has exhibited no false alarms, even when my dog scratches her neck vigorously around the collar. However, when she barks, it has always beeped. This collar has quickly broken the barking cycle so that now, after a single bark, she stops without ever activating the first shock level. It has been amazing that my highly intelligent dog has gotten the message that the first beep means ""no more barking"". She has never gone to level two. Prior to using the collar she would go nuts, barking incessantly at certain household noises. I highly recommend this collar, and if you NEVER want your dog to receive a shock, just tape over the electrodes and there will only ever be ""beep"" warnings. This thing definitely worked for my dog.",5
"Miss Ginger absolutely loves these Bully sticks - no smell, little 10# terrier's favorite",5
"I've purchased two of these toys for my two large malamute-mixes. The first one I purchased in October. With rigorous play it lasted until December. Then I bought another one as a Christmas present for the pups just recently.

Both of my dogs have different tastes in toys. Rascal, my big boy, likes anything that squeaks and can be torn apart. Coho, the complete opposite- a very picky girly girl, prefers to hunt things. She only likes toys with fur that she can chase. With that being said they both absolutely love playing tug-o-war with each other. It's the one game they both enjoy. This toy covers all aspects of both dogs. Rascal can squeak the squeaker in the head and tail. He can also tear the toy apart. Coho can chase the toy around and 'hunt' the fury creature. And they can both play tug-o-war with it against each other.

What's really unique about this toy is that there is no stuffing. It's made of faux fur (I'd rather see a real fur one, as real fur is digestible for dogs but faux fur is not- and bits of this toy have been accidently swallowed). Once torn apart- which took both of my dogs working together about a week to accomplish, there are two squeaky toys sewn inside. For larger dogs these are small enough to swallow so you will need to supervise your dog when playing with this toy. Once the squeakers are removed you will have to discard of them.

The soft fur-like material really keeps my dogs engaged. They are constantly fighting over it. Running and stealing it from each other. They are very big, very strong dogs who can play tug-o-war like a pro. So the fact that this toy held up with both of these dogs for two months is a feat to be accomplished. It did begin to rip in half after a month of play- but then the two separate pieces became toys of their own and they continue to rip and tear the toy apart until it was left in about 4 inch pieces all over the house. 90% of the time they didn't swallow the pieces. But on occasion Rascal did not want to give up his piece to Coho- so instead of setting it down he just swallowed it. Luckily he has a man's digestive system and popped it out. But like I said before, real fur would be a better option in my mind. Most of the toys I buy my dogs are made with digestible fur or leather. Faux fur is plastic- so it can't be digested. Just a thought in case your dog tends to eat his toys as well. When this toy begins to tear I suggest taking small pieces away as they are ripped off.

This toy really isn't a fetch toy. It's mainly for chewing and tug-o-war. The sewn-quality is amazing. It really did hold up fantastically. I was amazed at how long this toy lasted. Most of my dog toys are thrown out in a week or two. This lasted two months with both of my pups actively playing with it. For it's durability and universal-play opportunities I would hands down say this is a 5 star toy and would recommend it to people with large-breed dogs.",5
"Wow, this crate is really BIG!  It's too big to fit through the bedroom door when fully assembled, so I had to disassemble to get it through the frame.  The size is good for my two growing pups to kennel together and still have a lot of room to themselves.  It is very very heavy.  This is not something I could lift into the back of my SUV without help.  It's awesome to have a door on 2 sides, because it gives you more flexibility as to where you place the crate.",4
The cats love this.  I have to put it up at night so they don't make a lot of noise and keep us up.  They sit in the center of it and push the ball around up.,5
"This certainly does the job and will keep your floor from getting wet. I like the price point on this item, and it's easy to clean.",5
Crap,1
Too many items are too large for my dog,2
"Kitten absolute loves this and uses it as a bed, but scratches it as well.",5
These are perfect for use in a cat cage with rowdy kittens. It keeps them from turning over their food and water. Very easy to use and keep clean.,5
Works well,5
"This mat is essential in our household.  Out bulldog is very sloppy with both drinking and eating.  This saves our floors.  And, it can be cleaned up in a jiffy, unlike cloth mats.  I will never be without it again!",5
"I really wanted to like this but the magnets are actually way too strong.  I am a fairly strong person but using this is a real workout!  I don't know the thickness of my glass but I have a 35 gallon tank so I'm sure it's thicker than would be on a 5, 10 or 20 gallon.  It does do the job, eventually, but even with the razor blade attachment you have to go over the area a few times, and you'll probably want to take a break in between because it's so hard to move and maneuver.

Be very careful ordering this as it is ""not eligible for return"", though it doesn't say why.  I tried to return it well within 30 days and that's the message I got, with no explanation as to why.",3
"I've spent hundreds on fancy pantsy grain-free, single protein dog food for my Boston terrier with a vague allergy to... something. I got this at the grocery store because we ran out of food and I didn't feel like driving to the specialty dog store. To my amazement, she loved it AND her fur has never been shinier, never had less gas, and has never licked her paws so little. I bought more and it's been great ever since.... and cheaper to boot!!!",5
My kitten eats these for breakfast.,5
"BOY , Y DOGS LOVE THIS ...I put it in a Kong and they love working to get their reat",4
My parrotlets love this!  Just full of healthy stuff and they chowed down on it!,5
It does the job.,5
This pad perfectly fits the small eighteen inch crate. It's also nice on it's own for kitten litters. Put a pet heating pad under it and you have the perfect heated bed.,5
"This is my second purchase of this item. It's a really nice sweater for my little guy. The first one kinda a fell apart after about a year, although it doesn't seem to be flimsily made.
Sizing chart is inaccurate - a large fits my mini Schnauzer, so it's not for med-large size dogs.",4
I'm very disappointed. This my 2nd leash of this brand. My first one stopped working. I bought another one and after using it a handful of times; it also stopped working. I think maybe bending of the leash and the construction do not work together. My dog does not work in straight line.,1
make everything easy,5
The quality of this brand is not amazing but I gave it 5 stars because for the price you can't beat it. I've had mine 3 years now and I have 3 cats. I am actually shocked it's still standing. It feels cheap but it has really heals up. I would totally purchase another.,5
Great elevated feeding bowl. Easy to clean too!,5
Fit well.,5
There nice and thick and the biggest I have found but I have an extra jumbo litter box,5
"I bought the meadem, for my cat to have a warm place to sleep. It folds up flat & came wiht a carring case.",5
Doesn't work any better than 40 other products I've tried,2
Thank you this is one of the best products ever !!,5
"Bought these to try out since I recommend them to friends as an alternative to de-clawing.  They worked beautifully, my cat was unsure about them, but didn't attempt to take them off too much after the first day.  Certainly made giving her baths easier while they were on.",5
Accidentally nicked the kwik on a black nail and this stopped the bleeding instantly. Poor guy yelped at first but was fine after a minute.,5
I wanted my dog to like this food so she could have some variety in her lamb based diet. My dog is a tweenie longhaired dachshund who can only eat lamb based foods due to severe allergies to chicken and beef. I thought this food would give her some variety and would give me the opportunity to mix it up when feeding her so she wouldn't get bored. I typically feed her taste of the wild Sierra but she was getting bored with that. This food made her vomit to the point where she could hardly walk. I gave this food to my parents because their 16 year old rat terrier also eats a lamb and rice based food. He too became violently ill to the point he couldn't stand. My parents thought they were going to have to put him down this food made him so ill. I haven't just left this review I also went so far as to file an FDA report that the food made the two dogs sick. Both dogs made complete recoveries as soon as they had taste of the wild back in their bellies. I SWEAR I do not work for taste of the wild and am simply a consumer trying to warn other pet owners about this food.,1
"Do NOT BUY THIS FOOD FOR YOUR FERRET, i repeat do NOT!!! It is full of fillers, and is KNOWN to cause insulinoma in ferrets. I had my guy on this and his furr is matted, he has no weight on him and just overall is low in protein for them. Instead switch to kittdn high grade kitten foods. If you are a ferret expert like i am, you would know this. Go on ferret forums and fb groups and they will all say the same thing. This is equivalent to feeding fast food to a child all their life. Please do your research!!! Makes their furr stink more and poop too. I am only saying this because i care and love animals.",1
"This collar really works well, I have a very high-strung cat and this collar really does calm him.  I was surprised it worked, but it did.  This 3 pack is a good price, too, I paid this much for one at a local store.",5
Bunny Approved. She even tried to bite through the bag! Will buy more.,5
Ja!  quite fun... sounds like Santa's sleigh!!!  and now I do know just where my dogs are!!  specially when they are getting into trouble!  thank you!,5
best purchase! i use the dual leash to take 2 dogs at the same time. I love it. this is awsome. ppl smile when they see this.,5
"Our little Molly, 12 lbs, love this patties as a treat.  Have order in several different flavors.  She loves them all.",5

This by far the best food. My dogs are very old. They had issues with joint pain. With the grain free they are now pain free. Highly command.,5
Works really well keeping down the odours.  Wish they came in a larger size.,5
OK,5
A great product that cuts down on destruction of household items by a new puppy who is teething and full of energy.,5
"Excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good productoa an unbeatable price, I am happy for this purchase reallmente if needed would buy another product equal.",5
Works great!,5
"The product is superior, although not perhaps the tastiest. However if I switched from junk food to vegan, I suspect the result might be the same.

And the price is great. Given the quantity it is much the same price as the stuff they sell at the supermarket. It doesn't have the yummy ""chicken in a biscuit"" smell but it is way more nutritious according to all the internet investigation that I've done.",5
Consider 3 stars a neutral vote. Blood worms are blood worms frozen or dried,3
"I ordered these for my pug. You can't get more natural than an actual slice of chicken right? I was very wrong.

I immediately noticed how hard and dry these chicken strips were. I cut one in half using poultry shears and let the dog try one. My dog began choking on the piece of Cadet brand chicken. I had to physically pull it from his throat because it wouldn't dislodge itself due to how hard and dry it was.

Then, while checking the packaging, I read the words that every pet owner dreads...""Made in China""...which I'm pretty sure translates to ""Pet Killers with sub-standard products"".

I immediately threw them out and purchased all-natural treats made in the USA. (Plato brand).

I would NEVER recommend this Chinese made brand (Cadet) to ANY pet owner. Amazon would do well to create a ""Made in the USA"" section on its web site to avoid crappy, dangerous products like this one.",1

"This piece is ok.  It is nothing all that exciting; however, you get what you pay for.  It is a good size for a 5 gallon tank or less.  It added some fun color.",3
"I had 2 older model Littermaid boxes. They worked fine but they had a built-in design problem (planned obsolescence ?) so they only lasted a couple of years each. The power cord for the scooper would eventually break from metal fatigue at which point the scooper was dead. I bought the new model because Littermaid fixed the power problem by redesigning how the scooper worked. Unfortunately, although the power cord was fixed, the overall operation of the unit was vastly inferior to the previous models. The new scooper is supposed to slide on plastic rails but it always jams. The motor unit can't figure out when to stop backing up. The scooper itself is under powered. The older units worked fine; this new one almost never works. Save yourself the aggravation and the money. Based on my experience, I can't recommend this Littermaid product.",1
"This regulator works great for me. I'm using it on a 20g tank and my plants have grown quickly. I would give this 5 stars, but the adjustment could be better. However, considering this is a mini regulator, the dial is the pretty appropriate.",4
"I have a greyhound that had itching and scratching on one side of her face and I could never get her to stop - it looked terrible too!

I add this to her diet and her face has improved - no more scratches and loss of hair - she looks great!",5
"We bought this product because of the rave reviews but upon checking the ingredients, we were left unsure if such product is indeed great for our dog. The Glycerine ingredient was not clearly stated if it is Vegetable Glycerine. Lastly, the chicken breath the dog gets after is appalling. Unscented would have been better...we stopped using it and we are still on the hunt for the best healthy toothpaste for our fido.",3
"The material around the lip of the lid is very porous so once again I've had to throw away 5 pounds of dog food. I keep the food in it's original bag (which isn't resealable) and tape it shut storing a few dayS food in small containers. This month, for the second time the food went bad. In my case the white material used to ""seal"" the lid to the container is cracked and does not even wrap all the way around. This is the second container like this that I have and they're both the same. Poor design and should not be called airtight.",2
"My dogs really liked these, and they are made in the USA!!!  Great product for the pups!",5
Dog tore this apart in a day.  Fluff in the head part came out super easily. Would not buy again.,2
"Not sure which is easier to clean...the dust from regular clay or these crystals. Still, the odor control is so good that I would say it is overall a good choice.",4
"Do NOT get this food. I had previously written a glowing review of this food. We used if for years and just like so many other unfortunate people over the past couple of months my dogs would not touch it. We have had 2 dogs completely stop eating it. One dog has been in the vet several times for fluid on the lungs/coughing and distended belly. We moved him to this food starting in December. Hundreds of dollars we've spent at the vet with this recurring condition. I was curious if there was a recall and discovered so many other people here, on FB and online posting stories of the same kind of issues. We returned all of our unopened bags yesterday to our local store and changed foods ASAP.  BE WARE - something is not right with Taste of the Wild food cat AND dog.",1
Perfect for obedience training.  Its the perfect size for my toy poodle.  Well made.  I highly recommend!,5
"Our dogs love these! They're soft so they enjoy chewing them and eating them easily. I have little dogs so I tear them into smaller pieces and make a game out of it. Would recommend to a friend!

My dogs are young but very active which is why I have started them young on positive joint support. You're never too young to be healthy and prevent vet bills!",5
It is exactly what I wanted.  Good packaging.  Arrived on time.  Read directions about using a protien skimmer.,5
"This is the perfect exerciser for a puppy who needs lots of running around in the yard with no fence -
Also will begin recall training using this very strong and comfortable and fun long leash!  Highly recommend it.",5

"Oh my goodness!  Why did I wait to purchase this awesome carrier?!!! My service dog weighs a whole 3 pounds, so I always have just carried him in my hand.  Lately, my physical therapist said that it is no longer safe for me to walk without a cane AND carry him.  My only alternative, because he saves my life with his notifications, was to get him a carrier.

When it arrived this morning, I put him in it.  He LOVED IT!  He feels very secure right next to me, and I can now walk securely with a cane or walker.  We are both so happy and secure now!!!",5
This product works great and helps me keep my finned family members healthy and happy.,4
"I bought this leash so we'd have something a little longer to walk our Shiba with rather than the 4 ft. ones which are too short. It a bright day-glo orange which helps keep me noticible. The reflective aspect was appealing since I walk the dog after work and in the winter it gets quite dark in Cleveland.

However, after 6 months of use the reflective bits are flaking off, making it rather pointless. The metal clip on the end seems surprisingly heavy and did seem to weigh down the dog when she was a puppy but bear in mind she was maybe 9-15 lbs at the time. I now find myself in need of another one that's not flaking off the reflective strip. Otherwise, it's an okay leash.",3
"I bought two of these for the dogs of different members of our family. I tried them on our Miniature Schnauzers but our dogs don't really have an outer coat, just an undercoat, so they don't really work and the Dogs do not like them.

On the other hand, on our daughter's Australian Terrier, with a wiry outer coat, they remove the undercoat beautifully and she looks close to being ""groomed"" for the first time in her life. She did not enjoy the combing but didn't object to it.",4
"This worked so well after surgery.  I removed the ""cone of shame"" collar and slipped this on...it took about 15 minutes for my cat to get used to it. After that, the cat didn't even realize she had it on...only wished I had gotten it a few days sooner!",5
It may work fine for kittens but my older cats could care less about it.,1
Works great!,5
"Amazing!  I have two small goldfish in a one gallon tank with an air pump but no filter.  Without this, I was doing partial water changes every other day now I'm down to once a week! Highly recommend!",5

"a bit high in price but very good treats, my pup loves em.",5
"Neither of my cats- who eat pretty much anything- would touch this stuff. Literally walked away after sniffing it. Tried several times, even putting some in a little water. Very odd. They love any other brand but this.",1
I used these regular thru the winter on 5 outdoor cats in north Florida worked great but I had to switch to the fiproguard max as summer arrivied and had big flea population in my yard and I can tell a difference...good product good price...as I will continue to use fiproguard regular or the max.........,4
Ive purchased one of these in a store. Perfect for playing catch with dogs and putting treats inside to keep dogs occupied when you need them to be still and quiet!,5
the only way i can get a pill down my kitty cat! they love the taste.,5
"Excellent product.  I have 9 cats and 8 kitty litters.  I was really getting bummed cleaning the litters every day and having the dusty litter fill the air, my lungs, my eyes... ugh!  Things are much better now.",5
"I have a dog with arthritis and hates to take pills. She does not gulp her food, she chews everything. I wrapped the pill in everything to entice her to take it.  It is bitter, not only to the taste but she could  smell it in everything I tried. Braunswager (sp) Vienna Sausage, everything.  I wrap it well in the Greenie Pill Pocket and she eats it right up. I ordered two packages and both contents were in perfect shape.  No crumbs, no pieces, none smashed as I have read in other reviews.  Since the stores that carry these are not in my immediate shopping area, I find it's easier to order from Amazon along with other items I need. I will order again and I have already recommended to a friend and neighbor.",5
"This little thermometer works great. I have one on the floor and one near my Bearded Dragons heat lamp.  One glance and I can tell what the temp is. So far, they both have been accurate.",4
"Placed horizontally in lower middle of 40B tank. Extended nozzle and placed a piece of driftwood over water output, this slowed the flow by 25%. Flow is much too strong otherwise. Moves surface water of entire tank significantly. May try more driftwood to soften flow a bit more, or maybe floating plants.  Fish are not being thrown out of the water as before, they are adjusting to where flow is and avoiding the strongest current. Used for about three weeks and flow weakened to point it needed cleaning. Clogs in a fairly clean tank within a week, replaced with own media, does better. Horizontally, bottom half does not stick to tank, using a rock. Right next to bed, very quiet.

Used for a few months now with own media and floating plants, getting another one for my other tank. Clears floating plants from 25% of tank, works well, water flow is fine with floating plants.",5
does take out fur - but it ruined my beautiful Poms hair.....does something wierd - seems to permanently pull out hair.  DON'T BUY IT.,1
This ball is my cairn terrier's favorite.  Eventually after a many months it stops squeaking because of use / chomping.  It's also the easiest ball to misplace because of its size.  But it's his favorite so I continue to buy them.  I hope JW never stops making them.,5
The motor is very quiet or maybe it's the face that the burbling of the fountain overwhelms it. Ridiculously loud water noise compared to other fountains I've tried.,2
"Nice Light.

I bought this to replace the light that came with my Penn Plax curved glass 10 gallon tank. Although the cover prevents the brackets from seating on the edges of the tank, the overhang does allow it to sit partially on the edge and partially on the cover...

My only minor complaints are the switch is a rocker...with the Blue/moonlight on one end and the white/daylight on the other end with off in the middle...and the brackets...there is no catch or cap on the ends of the brackets so they can easily pull or even simply fall out of the main body/light.

Well worth the price of the lightening sale price!",5
"Had used Hill's Science Diet, 16lb. bags for my four cats. Switched over to this Nutro and the hairballs have stopped within days. The cats love the taste, the crunch, the smaller size and flat shape are all preferred, too. There has been no food barfed up after eating and I just ordered a second bag of Nutro. I originally tried the Hill's, expensive as it is, because my cats were all experiencing hairballs on a regular basis. The undigested food was extremely difficult to clean out of carpet, even with an enzyme cleaner and I was unimpressed with the lack of hairball control. So, my research continued...thank you Amazon reviewer's, and Nutro is what I found. My cats are happy campers.",5
"this toy ended up being smaller than I expected.  Smaller than my palm.  Also, my dog kept chewing off the legs and getting pieces all over and I was worried he was eating the latex.  I wouldn't buy it again.",2
my dog loves these. and they don't leave chewed up crumbs or smelly marks on carpets like other bones,5
I bout this for the inside of my puppy't crate. It's suuuuper soft and he absolutely loves it. I would even sleep on it!,5
"I feed Eukanuba to my cats, and thought I'd try this Weight Control formula for my slightly overweight small breed. While other Eukanuba varieties have great ingredients, for some reason, this Weight Control formula's first ingredient is...Corn Meal? Second is chicken by product. Actual chicken comes in third.

The packaging says that Chicken is always the most important ingredient - so why is it third? Also, this food is made for small breeds but the pieces are pretty substantial in size - too big for my 13-lbs dog.",2
I switched from Wellness indoor salmon formula to this one. I am very happy I did. The Wellness brand had a very fishy smell and was a lot more expensive per pound.,5

"Good dog toothpaste for the price.  But I have to use it every single day on my little dog (little dogs are notorious for tarter and bad breath).  Seems to work okay but if I miss a day, the plaque is back just as bad.  Arm and Hammer dog toothpaste barely did any better, but was three times the price in a smaller tube.  So I'll stick with this for a while.  At least the little guy likes it.",4
"I love these wipes!! I have a Shih-tzu with super sensitive skin and allergies. I use these to wipe her feet after each walk, which helps to cut down on the allergens brought in from outside. I also use them for general wipe downs and to clean her sensitive areas and she has never had any issues or reactions from them

Contrary to what another review said, these do not have any scent. I have gone through quite a few boxes of these over the last year and have never noticed a scent. I will assume he got a mixed up batch.

Earthbath also makes excellent ear and eye wipes as well. If you have a dog with sensitive skin, you should definitely give these a try.",5
Works great so far. We use the center headrest as the tether point in the backseat of the car. Our dog can move from window to the other just fine. I hope I never have to see the true test!,4
"Good collar.  Good quality.  Great price.  Sturdy.  Just do not understand why the word ""Leather"" is in its name/description, as it is made entirely of petroleum products with a steel ring.",4
The six pack was a great bargain compared to the three pack price in the local pet stores. I will definitely be purchasing again.,4
This top part seems to stretch out over time.,3
Not so invincible. My puppy shredded this in 20 minutes.,1
looks good on my dog,5
My Yorkie is absolutely nutty about these squirrels. And do they take a beating. They're well made and adorable. I highly recommend them.,5
"Our cats (and foster cats we take in for the local Humane Society) love these things.  Nice treat.  I can't tell if it keeps their teeth noticably cleaner (our 19+ year old had good teeth at her checkup and they've never been cleaned by a vet), but that's what they claim.",5
"My partner and I bought this for our 10lb French lop bunny who is quite tall when standing. The carrier was plenty big for probably two of him so I think he was quite comfortable. If you have 2 small-medium size dogs and need one carrier, this may work really well for you (Thag is if you have someone strong enough to carry it without a shoulder strap). If there were a 1/2 star rating I would give it a 4.5 overall for the following reasons:
Pros:
Lightweight
Ventilation (roll up windows)
Taller than most large carriers
A detachable carrying bag for food etc
Good hard bottom
Top and side openings
Great value at $26
Cons:
Lacking a good shoulder strap. It has two carrying handles, however you aren't able to throw this over your shoulder by a longer strap like all the other carriers Ive seen.
A bag this size would be better with wheels, however Im sure that would also increase the price.",5
Our dog Ace loves these!  I will buy again!,5
"My little Boston Terrier is a mega-chewer and these bones lasted awhile. They look and smell real! Thankfully they're edible, since it only took a few days for my pup to scarf one down. I'd suggest putting it away everyday so your pup won't eat it like mine did.",5
"I am not very happy about this food at all.

The description leads you to believe that chicken is the number one ingredient. You do not find out until you receive it that CORN MEAL is the number one and first ingredient. The ingredient list is not posted here on the product page, which is odd because Amazon always has a picture of that.

I have always liked Eukanuba in the past and buy their products from time to time for the dog, and more often for the cats. This experience and deception has given me a different impression of them.

You can go to any grocery store, kmart, walmart, tractor supply, etc and get a big ole bag of cheap dog food that has the primary ingredient of corn meal. You would pay less than half of the price of this Eukanuba. There's a reason I don't buy those kinds of foods. .. I don't want a bag of corn meal and grains!

I may sound picky and prissy, but I did not feed this to my dog due to the corn meal being the main ingredient.",2
So does his little brother!! And so does the cat lol. It's a great toy that keeps them interested! It's also one they love to savor vs destroying on the spot.,5
This works great on our little pups. Have only used it once on them so they were slightly hesitant b/c of the sound but it definitely saved us money on getting them professionally groomed. Although I need to master having them NOT look like they're getting bad at-home-haircuts. Haha,5
"I bought a Medium for my dog, but this Medium is too small! So, after waiting so long for it in the mail (which was expected), it didn't fit. So, buy a bigger size than needed!",2
cat doesn't care for it,2
Dog loves them!  Cleans her teeth!  A little expensive.,4
American made product..YES!,5
This appears to be a healthy product for our terrier mix puppy.  She likes it with white rice or a little cottage cheese on the side.,4
The furry feline kids seem to really enjoy the flavors and especially the moistness. Very pleased.,5
A little too small for my medium sized puppy. Watch carefully when your dog uses it. They may chew on the plastic cups instead of the tests under them! My puppy head fun with this challenging toy!,4
"I have two cats and one is prone to hairballs every so often. Once you see one coughed up on your floor-you want to get something to stop it. The Pet Naturals are the perfect choice. I almost gave my cat too many, but read where two per day is fine for skin/coat health and 4 per day for 2-4 days for hairballs. Since my cat has a mild case of hairball-itis, I chose to give 2 per day. The first time she tried it she spit it out, but quickly gobbled it up. They are larger size pieces then a cat treat. The cat seems to enjoy them and has had no adverse affect and no hairballs. Yeah!",5
"I should have sent it back, be sure to know the size of your toilet, newer toilets are oblong. I'm going to try city kitty",1
Smaller than I expected but it works so well!,5
"Available in round and rectangular in a variety of colors, patterns and sizes, these Dii brand Bone Dry storage totes are *perfect* for all our dog gear. I have these staged strategically in our home and have been teaching (or trying to!) our German Shepherds to ""put away their toys!"" which means I walk around with a reach type grabber tool and pick up alllll their toys for them. Lol I was pleasantly surprised at how durable these totes are - especially with my high drive (high energy) dogs. Love them!",5
"This is very sharp...much more so than the non-ceramic blade.  My dog has been sporting an almost bald patch, for a couple of months,
thanks to my first attempt at clipping her. Fortunately, she's not holding a grudge. Who knew that her hair would grow so slowly? Sadly,
a comb-over just isn't possible.",4
My beardie likes it :),5
My cat loves this.  It's thick and meaty. Too bad it's being sold at over two times the cost on Amazon.  Cans should be around $.58 each. Not $1.22!,5
I bought 2 of these for my girls and it is a very nice harness indeed. Soft and comfortable. I am happy and pleased with them.,5
"*update* the quality has been worse and worse with this frisbee.  The red ones got thinner since my first review and don't hold up as well or fly as well. This most recent black one is very flimsy and my dogs have holes in it after two weeks. I'm bummed because my dogs loved them and we used to get our money's worth.

Great frisbee. Lasts forever even used as a tug toy. The weight makes it fly far (I can get a few hundred feet) and its soft to not hurt the teeth and gums. My pit mixes can't hurt it for a good 6 months.",2
My dog loves these and they really do clean his teeth.  I have noticed an amazing difference since I started giving him these.,5
My husband is using this and is loving it.  He watched the video on u tube and it works as advertised,5
Good value.  My dog gets one a day and it's one of her favorite treats.,5
"I got these cause my cat LOVES THE FREEZE DRIED CHICKEN HALO MAKES...love is too weak of a word actually, check the reviews to see how it's Kitty Crack.  So I ordered these,  NEITHER of my cats cared for it, choosing a store bought over this.
Had to throw away.

If you were like me, thinking they will love another Halo product, save your money on this one!",1
"I have three kitties: two short hairs and one long hair. It works a lot better on long hair I think, but none of the cats like it. I think they are very uncomfortable when I use it on them.",4
Love this table! It's great for large and small dogs. Very sturdy!,5
great product,5
This works great for the cold winters we have in North Dakota. Easy to spread on his feet and seem to protect well on the cement when it's 20 below. Haven't had a chance to try it when it's 40 below since it's been a mild winter.,5
"Fairly easy to install and the magnets shut it tight. I had a screen guard already, so it worked perfectly.",5
"My husband and I seriously can't believe how much our cats love this thing. My lovebug, Nina, carries it around, following me, begging for me to play with her. She also takes it and hides it under the rug so her step-sister won't find it. Wish I would have known about this years ago!!! I could have saved a boatload. I found it by accident.",5
My Yorkies are picky so finding something they will eat is a good thing.  I have to slice it up for the 5 pounder.  It's to soon to tell if the product works but getting them to eat it is half the battle.  I can see the tooth paste froth so I'll keep my fingers crossed.,5
Love this brand,5
We use this for our redfoot tortoises enclosure. We still have it 2 years later. Its great. He loves it.,5
"Great product, fresh and smells great. Kaytee is a great brand of hay or grass to purchase. Great for tortoises.",5
"We have been using this product for years, and haven't found anything better. As the parents of nine cats, you can be sure we've given it plenty of challenges and it's always come through for us.",5
"My dog loves it, good ingredients and plenty of protein",5
Came on time. Works great. I was using OSI for a long time and it disappeared from stock through the sources I had purchased it from in the past.,5
"Very disappointed. Something about my dog's body shape makes sweaters that otherwise fit well, ride up really bad, and her rump is hairless (genetically). I bought this sweater specifically because I have the blue one of the same brand, which has leg straps, and multiple recent reviews of this sweater also talked about leg straps. My sweater has NO leg straps. It's very warm and well-made, but it rides up mercilessly. Back to the drawing board...",3
Good product,5
"After many years of chronic constipation and thousands of dollars in treating the condition, as well as trying different diets and supplements that claimed to help, this food was recommended by a vet. My cat was dying from constipation due to the shock on the body from the treatment to relieve the condition. Since starting this food, he has been going regularly and the stool is nice and soft. There is no more straining or crying in the litter box. He's 14 years old and has been on this food for six months and there have been no issues since starting. I wish I would have been told about this sooner since it would have saved the cat a lot of pain and would have saved me a lot of money.",5
"I have a cocker spaniel who just loves this toy.  It seems to be the one toy he does not rip the ears and tail right off of.  He seems to love hearing the donkey noise.  He does eventually tear it apart, but far slower than others.",5
"I LOVE THESE GUYS AND GALS!! I have a HEAVY CHEWER! and I usually can only buy him KONG! BUT I found another brand I can but from now!! #ChuckIt These are very lightweight. Fits in my hand perfectly to throw for my dog! It came in a two pack which is perfect because we have 2 dogs here at the house! Ever since I bought these #ChuckIt balls, both dogs have been prancing and running around all day long with these in their mouth! Like I said...my dog is a HEAVY cheese, and he takes a break with it and lays down and just chews it. Like he's exercising his jaws with it. He tried tearing it up...like tearing little pieces off of it and it was a NO GO!! and that means a whole Lot!! So, thumbs up to you #ChuckIt!! You have you a new customer!! #ChuckIt #Amazon",5
Best bird food ...my grey loves it.,5
Work well,5
"The instructions to but this together are HORRIBLE. Also, it wobbles quite a bit on the door, and even though you can adjust for height a little bit, you can't get it on the door if you have a door handle, because it slides along the top and bottom. Only one of my two cats use it because they don't like how wobbly it is.",2
"""Our natural dog treats are made with real meat as the first ingredient""

I looked at the ingredients listed and wheat flour was the first ingredient.  Decided not to buy.",1
"When they say large, they really mean miniature poodle. These were far too small for my 50 lbs dog. I bought them hoping to give her more traction on the hardwood floors, but I couldn't fit them over her toes.",1
"For some reason, I doubt this collar goes up to 23"".  I bought this for my 52 lbs. Boxer, and it did not fit so I returned it.

I bought the large, moved it to the smallest setting, and that fit.",2
a bit big,4
"These pans are very good and I'm talking about the xxx large (48 inch long by 29 inch wide)- used them for over a month - I will definitely purchase more - My 65/75 lb males that do their ""dinner dance"" have yet to damage these heavy duty trays.  Money well spent!",5
"It was a horrible toy. My dog could not get the treats out of the pods, and after getting aggravated by the toy decided she would try to chew on it instead. I had to take it away within minutes or she would have been swallowing small bits of plastic!",1
When I received there was human hair in the toy. It's disgusting because dogs only can play toy with their mouth.,1
Super fast delivery and easy to install.  Easy to keep clean and vacuum.,5
"My dog likes this toy, I like the fact that it has something inside his arms and legs that makes crunchy noise when touched.",4
"Super easy to screw into or out of the ground, which is great when mowing the lawn. It's also very visible if you forget to take it out or while walking or playing with your pup. It has been very sturdy, even when puppy has tested her limits on many occasions :) We have 2 kinds of ties for her - one is a metal lined cable that we can clip onto the link & leave her out for a bit on - the cable can spin around the base so she doesn't get wrapped up. The second is a longer cotton-leash training lead that has a handle that slips over the top and stays secure. We use this for training things like ""come"" and playing fetch. All have worked great...actually, with a very energetic puppy, these have been a LIFESAVER! We were even able to give this to a family member when we went away on vacation and she easily used it at her house too. Does not leave a huge hole in the ground. Love it!",5
My parakeet seemed to like it.  Pretty sturdy.,4
Fits in cage well.,4
"I've only been using this for a couple of days now so I will update the review later after having it longer. But for now I am pleased with this product. It came as described, I love the collars and they work. My dog is however at a 75 out of 100 on the shock setting and I'm not sure if it's because my dog is that stubborn or if the like power of the collar is sort of weak so it needs to be higher than a stronger one. I'm not sure but it does work. I haven't had any issues but I also don't leave the collar on my dog. It's on her for usually an hour at a time for training purposes and that's it. I'm already amazed at the difference I have seen in her.",4
Needed a cheap scoop to throw away after my cats radiation treatment. Fits the bill and not a lot of money so you can throw it out afterwards.,4
"We have had this for less than a month, but it was welcomed immediately by our aging Lab!  It is easy to clean, no punctures so far.  I did raise it up and put it on the 2 Buddy Beds we have for our pack of aging lovies.  Very strong, very cooling - I wish they made this Woman sized for this Georgia heat!  Buddy Dude comes in from his walk and prompted self-cools on this mat.",5
"I have several cats and this is one of their favorites. The ones I received are plastic and seem pretty tough. My cats love it when I throw them so they can chase them down. One of my cats love them so much he knows the drawer that we keep the bags of new ones in and he will hang on the drawer until it opens, then get in and pull out these toys.",5
My 2 cats absolutely love their mice. The squeak sounds just like a real mouse. The volume is great. It is really soft and made with some great materials. I purchased 3.,5
Just received my courtyard kennel today & set it up immediately. I highly recommend this product to any small dog owner or puppy owner. This pen is nicely built. Not the type of flimsy material play pens you would find at your local pet store. Has a very nice appearance & spacious for your furry friend.,5
"My sister purchased this product for her 15 lb dog.  He stays with me on the weekends and in the last few months, I noticed that he was always itchy and always licking and chewing his fur all over his body.  During baths I noticed he had multiple red spots where he was bitten.  Lately, there would always be 2-4 fleas in the bath tub and last week I found a tick on his face.

We checked with our vet and she said products sold outside of the vet's office are not effective.  She has not come across a single success story amongst her clients regarding use of these products purchased online or at big-box stores.  I speak from experience...do not waste your money purchasing these products online.  They don't work.  More importantly, don't put your dog through so much misery and discomfort or place them at risk of illness from disease carrying pests.",1
"It's a wonderful fountain and not hard to clean. The only downside is my 6 month old kitten loves to play with water and keeps pushing the tower off the sealed pump. Once he does that, the water stops running through. It's very annoying and I wish it were sturdier and harder for my kitten to knock off. Hopefully he grows out of it because I really like this fountain and it is very expensive.",4
"I had never heard of the SportDogFood brand until I was given the opportunity to give this food a try.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Looking at the food, it's darker in color than other kibbles I feed my dogs.  The pieces are small, so dogs of any size will likely be able to eat this food.  The bag it comes in is taller and less wide than most other food bags.  This makes it easier than average to place in my dog food canister.  One minor quibble is that my bag was slightly torn in one spot.  The tear wasn't large enough for food to fall out, but it concerned me slightly.

My dogs both seem to love this food.  One of my dogs sometimes turns down her morning meal, but with this food, she has been eating her breakfast every morning.  I'm guessing the novelty will wear off, but for now she seems to like it more than most kibbles.  In terms of stomach issues, my dogs seem fine with this food.

Looking at the ingredient list, I don't see anything that concerns me.  The ingredients seem to stack up with other high end foods.  On the plus side, this food is less expensive than many other premium dog foods.",5
My little Pickle rides a motorcycle every day. The Doggles look great and she likes wearing them. She has her picture taken in traffic at least 3 times a day.  The only drawback is that they scratch very easily and the lenses are expensive to replace.,4
Dogs love it,5
"These don't smell too promising, but my dogs love them. While they're not quite doggy downers, it does seem to help calm dogs a bit. As others have noted, there's no single magic pill, but combinations of things work.",5
Kind of a nice product. You don't smell the urine at all but you need a scooper with large holes so that when you school the poops - the pine pellets will go back into the litter box.,3
"OMG!! really stinky!!!...I got a headache right away,and into the garbage it went! Also, I opened the collar, white pieces of scent? went all over the kitchen,then fell off around the house as the cat moved around...it was a stinky mess to clean up...what a waste of money! :(",1
"This stroller is attractive, well built and priced right. Be prepared to attract looks of curiosity as you push your sweet fur baby down the street in this beast. My indoor cat loves to go on short walks around the block, sometimes travels with us on vacation and goes to the vet in this stroller. This stroller has served me well for at least 3 years now and is still in like new condition.  If you have a particularly smart pet, caution must be used at all times as my boy has figured out where to paw the zipper to try and get it open. He has not yet succeeded. 5 stars, great product, great seller, fast shipping!",5
"Very happy with this purchase! Size M fit my fluffy 12 pound shitzu perfectly! Easily machine washable & has held its colors. Soft material but sturdy. Very happy customer.

Update: its been almost 2 years since I bought this. It had held up very well through numerous trips through the wash! The color has faded but not nearly to what I had expected! I stand behind my original review 100% & highly recommend this! For the price, you seriously cant pass it up!",5
There was nothing left in about a hour.,1
"Ripped at the seams in less than a year on one of the ends. Other than having to use duct tape, my 39lb pup loves it. Didn't like it at first though but now...it's his resort away from his other resort toy.",3
He goes bananas for this toy!  Hours and hours of entertainment and fun....no other toy has ever engaged him as much as this one.  He literally will drag it around the house to find me and drop it at my feet and meow to get my attention to play with him.  Great toy.,5
"I don't recommend it for puppies, I'm a Yorkie breeder and I know exactly how often and everything about worming puppies. My puppies got sick from hookworms anyway. I recommend to use a wormer for dogs.
I won't mention brand because I don't want to sound like a salesman for a certain brand. I just share my experience with this brand.",1
"This has been worn by our hyperactive 2-year old chocolate lab for almost a year in the snow, rain, mud, sun, and to day camp. Somehow it has still survived and doesn't smell as bad as some other collars we've bought for her. Should it ever break down, we'll buy another.",5
"My dog LOVES this and loves eating his kibble out of it.  He doesn't always eat a bowl of kibble (he's a picky eater) but he'll at some point play with this and eat his kibble that way.  It's also really cute watching him play with it.

So far the item seems pretty sturdy. There are definitely chew marks all over it/ it's scraped up and scratched up a bit, but nothing seems to be deteriorating.",5
all deadin2 days even eith food and water,2
What can I say about poop bags they work and don't leak. Good buy.,5
"This is a knock-off of Puppia Sports Soft Vest Harness, the one that comes in several colors plus camo.  The cut is close to Puppia but not exactly, and consequently the fit isn't quite as good.  The holes for the legs are different and there is more material at the front of the dog and under the chin.  When the D rings are fastened there is a slight bulging at the front and sides of harness.  I bought size large for my bigger Chihuahua who has a deep chest.  It is well made but one mistake they definitely made was using white Velcro to fasten around the top of the back.  It should have been black to match the black harness.  As far as the D rings go, they are not too large for the size I bought.  This a good alternative to Puppia and is slightly cheaper.  I tried this brand because I couldn't find the color and size I wanted in Puppia, so it is possible that the Sports model is no longer being made.",3
"Our two cats are Temptations Treats addicts!  My husband and I joke all the time that they will kill us in our sleep if we run out of these things. Dairy flavor seems to be their favorite, but they come running for all of them so we'll normally buy the one that's on sale at the time.  Every night before bedtime they each get a few of the treats.  Now, if we even go near the box they go crazy!  Anyone know of an AA group or something our cats can join?",5
"We needed a soft muzzle for our Great Pyrenees.  She wakes up around 2AM every night (well, morning) and wants to thoroughly patrol the backyard before returning to her bed.  The only problem was that she likes to let off a few rapid barks during her rounds-- and the sound really carries.  We live in a residential neighborhood with houses packed in fairly tightly.  With this muzzle, our big girl can check her perimeter for wolves (or monsters?)... to her heart's content.  We unsnap the muzzle the moment she trots back through the door, and tell her what a good girl she is for keeping the yard safe in the dead of night... when the wolves, monsters, and mailman are probably asleep anyway.  This is the first time we've tried a muzzle and it's been great.  Super easy to use, and it doesn't seem to be uncomfortable at all for our dog.  As an added bonus, we can let her have a little more time out in the cool night air (she always wants a few more minutes-- calling her inside is like trying to drag a kid away from a ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese's).  Before we had the muzzle, we had to stand by the door, ready to recall her the moment she let out the first bark.  Now she's happy to get some bonus time outside, and the neighbors won't be woken by barking (at least from our yard).",5
House never smells I also bought armor hammer powder stuff to help. Amazing. Clumps so well. Beat litter Ive ever used.  Tracking is still an issue but Im buying a different cat box to help reduce that.,5
Easy use.  Friendly,5
My parakeets love this. They hollowed it out in a few weeks.,5
"Easy to use, cleaned eye area without any problems",5
One of the best dog training tools I've ever used!!  Thank you!,5
"I have a husky/ alaskan malamute mix. So they were born for pulling sleds. Along with a proper training regiment and sticking to it, the only other thing that truly helped was this collar. Had tried various different collars but this one takes the cake, and after studying health effects of each type, as long as a prong is used safely is the best collar you could use. This includes all those easy leaders and such as those personally wore the skin on my dogs face (along with not helping him walk calmy with me as he hated it) but has shown to alter the dogs posture and lead to early on hind leg and back issues.

Make sure you watch the various videos on how to fit it, but basically it supposed to be up high on the head, not low down on the neck. also tight so as it won't slide down. Also this is not supposed to be put over the dogs head. With using it I actually use both rings to walk my dog, it takes out the slack and enables a instant correction with translates to the dog quicker as opposed to a slowed correction after which will not translate to the dog what are you correcting him for. This helped  with transitioning to further more harder training exercises",5
yum yum mewow,5
still chewing on it after several months...,5
Got a really great deal on these dog biscuits - kind of got a buy 1 get 1 free deal,5
Love this cat littler keeps my home smaling nice and you can't tell i have three cats in my house. will order this again,5
I found these at Walmart and my dogs loved them.  I then ordered them from Amazon.,5
"Been through - literally - every type of bedding available with guinea pigs and now gerbils. This stuff is simply crinkled pieces of recycled paper, but it's awesome for a few reasons:

1. there is NO DUST, none - some brands say there isn't but there is, this is paper, there is no dust at all, ever
2. this stuff is totally absorbent, but has no smell, and allows for very little smell if you keep up on cleanings
3. it is easy to clean up. with pine I used to use a scoop, and carefresh would get clumpy. this is a breeze.
4. this stuff goes a LONG way - do not be put off bag the bag/box. Gerbils have a 40 gallon tank and even when I
create a THIN layer they move it around and ""sculpt"" it to their liking and it ends up being more than I needed
(i.e. those crinkles make the paper expandable, and eventually these creatues will make it expand when they dig and
move it around)
5. recycled
6. ironically, my wife has many allergies and this is the only bedding that didn't bother her (nevermind the pets)

Recommend very highly.",5
Small bites are very important  to our Malti poo.  He loves this food.  Always in his bowl.,5
"This food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues, it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein, like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food, despite having some unbeknownst to me, chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken), but if it weren't for that, this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house, including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol, I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back, hopefully keeping them all itchy and tummy trouble.

UPDATE 3/1/15:  This is very late, but I wanted to put this information out for anyone else that might be interested in monitoring what goes into their pets' food.  Having initially been thrilled with this food and the fact that all three of my cats happily ate it, I discovered information about Carrageenan and the inflammation that it causes.  Upon lots of researching and even an e-mail to the manufacturer requesting they remove it, I have taken this food out of my cats' rotation and my own diet, as well.  Instead, I only feed my cats Nature's Logic brand which contains enough actual meat product that taurine is not added because it is not necessary.  Here's a little tip for you...the cat and dog food varieties have the same ingredients, so if you have several cats, like me, you can purchase the larger dog food version much cheaper.  It's actually a bit cheaper than wellness if you shop around (my last order of the chicken flavor came from chewy.com and was around $30/case for 12/13.2 oz. cans with free shipping over $49).  All of my cats do extremely well on it and have no issues at all on it.

At the very least, do some research on Carrageenan and you will see it is not something that we should be ingesting or giving to our pets.  I was horrified to find that one of the commenters in an article, who worked in a lab, said they intentionally gave carrageenan to lab animals to induce inflammation.  That comment, along with all of the other articles I read from people I respect, have convinced me it is not safe for us or our pets and I will not be buying any more products that contain it.",3
2 of my cats love the toy. Everyday one of the 2 go over to it and push one of the balls around the circular trough. Don't seem to be attracted to the catnip much but that's not why I got it.,5
"Love these, they are small, have good ingredients, GREAT for training. Zukes has great products! Will order again as this is a great price, too.",5
Love the grooming table..I have 4 different sized dog breeds..table is heavy sturdy and has a good surface.. !!!  :),5
We took our Frenchie to Florida with us in this case.  It worked well on the Virgin America flight....the only feedback is perhaps the redesign could be a softer version so it can be pushed under the seat better.,4
Our puggle was having a hard time with his hip. I started giving him these and he is doing fine now. Very happy with this.,5
Item arrived on  time and as describe.,5
My english bulldogs LOVE this stuff.  One squirt per meal keeps their coats shiny and the dogs lick the bowl for several minutes after the food is gone.,5
best purchase on Amazon to date. This raincoat is easy to put on and keeps your pet dry.,5
"I bought this for my mastiff who kept scratching at two bruises on his face and neck he got while romping around with his sister. Firstly the comfy cone is extremely well made and has been thoughtfully designed. The Velcro straps are strong and allow for considerable adjustment. The cone itself is well padded, waterproof and flexible all while providing excellent protection from scratching to the face and neck (which is why I bought it). It secures very nicely and the addition of loops to run a collar through made sure it stayed on no matter how my dog tried to take it off...and try he did. He was very uncomfortable wearing it at first...it must be a weird sensation after all but he got used to it in no time and pretty much forgot he was wearing it. All in all a great product and a must have for any dog owner.",5
Perfect product for my dogs paws.,5
"It has a clean & uncomplicated look to it, nicer than pictured.  Directions wrong,  easily put together by looking at picture and a little thought.",5
My cats love it... The only thing or probably my mistake I ordered thinking it was the entire toy and then I realized it was just the arch. But I got the scratcher and they love it,4
my cat has a disease which takes away functions from her back legs she is fine with jumping up but jumping down is a problem the stairs fit perfectly for my bed and I have no worry that she can just walk right down them. They were very easy to put together.,4
"I like the item.  My dog does not like the sound of Velcro coming apart so I had to use a lot of treats to get it on him.  Today I put his collar through the loops, I had kept the cone at the right size and was able to slide it over his head instead of fastening it after wrapping it around the head.  I only gave 4 stars because it was difficult to get the braces out of it so I could roll the top back.  But once I removed the braces it was easy to roll back which allowed for more visibility for my dog and more air flow.  My dog is a Samoyed and very furry so as much air as I can give him while he has to wear one these the better.  Also, he can drink water while wearing this one where he couldn't with the plastic one.  And if he bumps into something or me the cone bends so it doesn't hurt.",4
"IF you're going to allow your bunnies to eat pellets as part of their diet, these are the best IMO!",5
"Excellent product, excellent service!!!!",5
Very pleased with the product. Would recommend this product for anyone with a large dog. My dog weighs 109 and easily adjusted to using the ramp.,4
as expected,5
Very good quality but my cat stopped eating her food with this bowl.  She wouldn't even try to get her kibble out.  Better for treats to slow down a chowhound.  Cats will make more effort with treats in the bowl.,4
Perfect for puppy training.  Don't have to worry about buying some for a while and the price is great.,5
"When it's treat time for my gerbil girls, this is what they're expecting! They absolutely love the blueberry yogurt treats! I can't ever let myself run out. My rat girls love them too!",5
"My puppy loves this toy. He likes to keep entertained and the challenge of getting the squirrel out keeps him busy! Only concern is there is a string to hold the toy at the top (my puppy loves strings) and she tore it apart immediately. I just cut it off to prevent her from swallowing it. Other than that, great idea, it definitely intrigues my puppy!",5
"This is the brand I always buy. It's a great product; my cats thrive on it.
Amazon offers it at a very good price, but out of the two cases -- 48 cans -- only about 10 were not dented, and some were damaged to the point that the seal was broken.  I ordered cat food from Amazon twice, and each time, nearly every can was dented.  I only ordered a second time because I understand accidents happen, and I was able to return the most severely damaged cans, but the second order was even worse than the first, so I will be buying all my cat food from Petco from now on.",3
"My cats love these but I have to break them up, 2 of my cats had stomatits & had to have all their teeth pulled, cause they can't chew them. I like they are made in the USA & are just 1 ingredient. Give your kitties a healthy treat!",5
This is easy to use.  It is a nice size for doing small trim work.,5
"Finally broke down and purchased the big jug as opposed to the 500ml. I have 15 fish tanks and couldn't do without this product. Most other hobbyists would agree. Just make sure to PAY ATTENTION - this one is one capful per 100 gallons, not per 50 gallons like the smaller bottles. So this will actually last even longer. Highly recommended!!!!",5
My cat and I really like this mat! It is a nice size and is easy to clean. A good buy.,5
Our dog loves these.,5
My Golden devoured these bully sticks!  I may have to get a second job to support his bully stick addiction.,5
"I tried quite a few different dog foods for my dog. She was having some fairly serious gastro-intestinal issues with Science Diet brand dog foods, and other foods that I tried caused excessive...back end emissions. This food has completely cleared the intestinal issues and the emissions issues. Anybody who owns a dog probably knows what I'm talking about. I'm a definite convert, and will continue to buy this food for this pet, and any pet I may own in the future. Good ingredients, high quality and grain-free. Great product!",5
This toy is my kitten's favorite. We like it so much we've even named it (Freddy the Flamingo). I don't understand some of the negative reviews. Ours has held up to a lot of abuse.,5
"IDEAL for training! These gummies break apart easily in one hand, allowing you to give the pertinent commands to your pup with the other. I tend to get a good eight to ten pieces out of each gummy, and even my 70 lb dog is satisfied with these little morsels (though he's pretty training-focused, in general). And, at the price, you can certainly feel free to give a whole gummy as an occasional special treat.",5
Dogs loved it while it lasted.  It did fray after about a month so we had to throw it out.,4
Well made.,5
"Very nice bowl, as described.",5
"This is a nice, secure harness, would be hard for a dog to get out of it and escape, however it is NOT a no pull harness and actually ENCOURAGES pulling. The large front panel is similar to a sleigh dog harness and did NOT stop my dog from pulling AT ALL.

I do like how easy it is to put on, just slip over the head and clip around the tummy. I have an 8 month old Lab puppy who is super wiggly and this is very easy to get on him. We use when hooking him outside as we can be sure he cannot escape. The harness also fits kind of weird. It is baggy in the front, doesn't fit flush. However, my lab is a bit chesty and broad, so it may be better on a more petite dog.

All in all, not a terrible product. High quality material, easy to use, but I will reiterate, it does NOT deter a dog from pulling. If your pup isn't a puller, this would probably work great for you. If you don't mind being lugged around, this would also work as well.",3
"First, I don't know why I didn't try litter liners sooner. Make life so much easier and I end up changing the box more often, the house is cleaner, the cats are happier. Win win. I have the Clevercat top entry litter box and tried the Clevercat liners, but they were (a) flimsy, (b) had a lot of defects (in one box, 5 of 10 were torn and unusable) and (c) these are slightly larger in dimension and fit the litter box better.",4
They do the job,5
"My cats love this!  It's a shame that there's not a full 30 cans in each case, because we're always off in Subscribe & Save.  Perhaps Purina does thins purposefully...",4
I really like this decoration.  Its natural looking. Cost effective compaired to the stores. Fish seen to enjoy swimming though it while foraging.  Very nice item,5
excellent quality very good product and far less expensive than Staples and the quality is as good if not better than Staples,5
"My cats love these and I love watching them play with them (though not so much during their 3:00 AM happy hour).  Have a whole collection under the couch, chairs, refrigerator and every other nook and cranny but well worth it -- I just bought more of them :))",5
"I have a 14 lb mixed breed 2 year old dog that has had a tough time with skin allergies this summer. We tried apple cider vinegar, with only very temporary relief. We tried a bath in Head & Shoulders (which works beautifully for fleas, I might add), but she still scratched and scratched. I finally took her to the Vet and she got an antihistamine shot, and the relief was almost instant... except in ONE spot just above her tail. I do think it was over-irritated from all her previous scratching. I used this Pro-Sense Hydrocortisone Spray and it gave her immediate relief. I repeated it twice and day, and soon the scratching stopped completely and the irritated areas were healed. The dog is happier and I'm happier. I recommend this product.",4
"Much thicker than I was expecting. If you have a big dog, this would be good. If your dog has a smaller neck, it might be a bit too much.",4
Works great for us and Cat.,5
Exactly what we needed!,5
Easy to use as a treat or food. Dogs love it.,5
"These are a hit, but are expensive",3
I did not like the presence of nitrites to preserve color.,3
"Best Friends by Sheri 2-in-1 Pet House-Sofa Zoo Zebra Brown, 15x17x15-Inch,...is supposedly a medium size that should fit my small dachshund but doesn't even come close!  he can't even turn around in it and she is only 15' long!  As a couch it is even smaller and totally useless!  I am returning it!",2
Best food around for puppies!  I have small breeds so I moisten with water.  The babies think they are eating filet mignon!  Great food for the quality and price,5
"My cats LOVE this stuff, even my picky eater, though she won't eat it cold. No big deal, 5 seconds in the microwave and it's good as new to her. I don't like that it contains meat by-products, but it's still absolutely the best food for the price. Choose this instead of the fish, and choose classic over grilled/gravy or any of the others. Those contain higher carbs, which aren't great for your cat.",4
Great leash for training.,4
"I've had other expensive bark collars.  This collar is perfect for the price.  My 14 lb yap hound comes to my small business with me every day.  He barked at each arriving client, to the point I had to put him in another room until they left.  He's a year old, and not the brightest star in the sky, but he learned how to use this collar in one day.  I feared he wouldn't get the big picture and would need corrected over and over, it's not my intention to shock my dog.  My little guy only needed a shock correction one time to learn.  Now when I place the collar on, he may bark once, but the alert beeps is all he needs from continuing.  He's now enjoying his days being pet by my clients, rather than barking behind a closed. door.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5...  my client brought his dog for a visit.  My dog did not bark, but my client's dog did.  The sound of the other dog's bark made my dogs collar beep.  I immediately removed the collar before my pooch was corrected for the barking of another.  So far, that's been the only draw back.  (one note:  My dog is not left unattended with this collar on.  He with me when wearing it.)",4
"Not sure if I will continue to purchase these, but they do help keep the water fresher longer. I already frequently clean my fountain, so I may skip these altogether in the future.",3
These might work but none of my cats will eat them.,2
My dog loves them!,5
Fit fine but did cause redness under arms,5
I love it. No more aluminum foil covers. They fit perfectly on the dog can. They DO NOT fit on a regular 15 oz. food can or pumpkin can for dogs.,5
"Bought this extra small toy for my 5 month old yorkie puppy and as soon as I took it out of the box he was in love.  This is such an adorable toy and he seriously plays with it every single day, all the time almost to the point of annoying lol.  Would recommend to everyone",5
My 14 1/2 year old Labrador loves this.  We crumble it up on her food and tell her it's brown sugar.  She can sit and stand with comfort because of PhyCox!,5
This is a good product but i need return the first time i buyed because was used and came dirty and don't work right. The second time i buy is good but i think came with the bioballs and charcoal and only have the sponge. I use my owns bioballs and charcoal. Works goods and the fish tank is very clear.,4
"These filters fit perfectly in my new teardrop-style Pioneer Pet water fountain. I'm glad I got them when I got the fountain because now I know I'm covered for a long time. You're supposed to change these every 2 to 4 weeks, and I think a 4-week schedule will work just fine.",5
Great for after the dog park or any doggie accidents. Fresh scent and freshens my little pup!! Travel container convenient.,5
Great food....wish my hammy liked it more than she does.,4
"I wish there was more pockets to store stuff on the outside.  Otherwise, it's perfect for on-the-go crate.",4
Love this product so much. Lasts forever and the two containers is nice because I always manage to lose mine,5
"Finally we can subscribe! We have 4 large cats and love this system. We have tried all types and this is hands down the best we've found to date. I have 4 boxes on various levels of the house and the cats are very happy with these boxes. Very easy to clean and the only gripe is that Purina has the market cornered on these. Farm supply and aquarium supply companies sell Zeolite (the component material) but you have to get what will fit the box screen. If you do the math properly you will discover that these do not cost any more than regular clumping litter and are not smelly, easy to clean and not nearly as messy.",5
"I love it ,,my dog is a 83 pound shar pei  ( he's big for a shar pei ) well he  got on it with no problem then I turned it on he started walking right away ..he gets on it everyday .I started him out slow and built him up to faster pace slowly  and slowly built up the time he stays on it... . you can see it working the muscles as my dog walking on it .  very easy to set up , it weight is about 90 pounds  I had help getting it in the house but I  got it out of the box myself and set it up  I am 110 pounds  female I had no problems  . on their video it sounds loud but really isn't  , you can control the speed and it shows the miles and calories  that are being burned off  and there is and emergency pull button  witch I have not had to use , there is a on and off switch on the lower left front side , the red side panels I used at first but my dog stays on it so took them off, and I saved 20 dollars by ordering from Amazon with the free shipping . I have had this for at least two months now and had no problems  .  you can see more videos on the dog pacer  on youtube  ,seems a lot of dogs enjoy it .  I do recommend this  it's made good .",5
"I have two male rats that like to sleep in this bed. It is not super soft or plush so I put a small piece of fleece on top. I like the fact that it comes with a hook so they can't move it all around the cage or flip it. Easy to wash, dry on low.",5
We use this stuff on our dog's nose at least 3 times a day.  It really seems to help with the scabbing.  I think his nose actually gets itchy because of the scabs and if I don't put this on his nose he will start to rub it in the grass or the carpet and can sometimes cause a bloody mess.  Snout Soother is a great managing solution for his lupus.,5
"Nice and plush, my cat loves it.",5
"When I first bought this product, it worked okay.  I have 4 dogs and my Labrador Retriever was a real problem when it came to eating dog waste.  After I tried Coprophagia Chews, she got better, but still ate her own waste.  She stayed away from the dogs'.  Now she has gone back to eating whatever she can find.  I have to go outside with her, even in the fenced in area to keep her from ingesting it.  i wouldn't worry so much about it, but she sometimes throws up after eating the waste.  I gave this a three-stara because it worked for a while, but it doesn't work for all dogs and may not work after a while.",3
Cats kept vomiting  after eating this,2
My dog loves these bones!,5
not as expected,2
Buyer beware. These lids do not cover the smaller cans of cat food.,1
Great for the dogs ears.,5
"This sweater is so cute and fits my Shih Tzu so well, in a medium.  The material is soft and he wore it for most of Christmas day with no complaints.",5
I love how lightweight and portable these are.,5
Works fast - my dog stopped shaking her head within a couple of days of using it.  Saved me an expensive trip to the vet.,5
"Cats go bananas for this stuff!  I made the first batch of cat toys with it and gave one to a friend to test out with her cat.  She was sure her cat wouldn't like it, she'd never been crazy about catnip toys before, but she went nuts for this stuff!  It has a very strong scent (quite pleasant to me), and the package I got was good quality.  This size package would last a normal household for years, but if you have a ton of cats, are looking for a great donation for a cat rescue/shelter in your area, or make cat toys, this is for you!  I'll be ordering another soon!

Update 11/17/17: BEWARE OTHER SELLERS!  I am revising this review again after contacting the manufacturer.  I previously ordered 2 or 3 bags from seller EarthWise Aromatics, and received the product on the right in the images attached.  I was irritated to find when I re-ordered from another seller and then from Amazon directly that I received a completely different product, much coarser and with tons of stems.  I assumed that they might have changed the cut for a new batch or there was some other explanation for the variation from Frontier, but it turns out that I was sent an incorrect item in all of my first orders.  If you receive a clear plastic bag, a bag with a zip closure, or a bag with catnip looking anything other than like the bag on the left of my images, you were not sent true Frontier Co-op catnip!  Frontier always uses the same kind of bags and has not changed their manufacturing.

Much as I hate to do it to an Iowa company being a native Iowan, I am also removing a star due to the inferior quality of the cut in the true Frontier brand product.  Their product is full of stems, many over an inch long.  It does have the same strong scent as the other stuff I received previously, though, so I have no doubt that cats will still enjoy it.",4
Perfect for my dog who hates the pills.,5
"This is nothing like the aspen bedding I'm used to using.  Rather than it being chips or shavings, its chopped into very small pieces - similar to saw dust.  Much finer than shown on the photo.  As a result, it does not fluff up and can not be tunneled through and the particles are so small that it can be inhaled into the nasal lining and lungs of anything living in it.
Not a good value.",1
"Pet Food Can Covers
I think the quality of these lids is good, but they don't fit Fancy Feast cans.",2
Will not walk my dog without it. My 110lb labradoodle loves to pull and sniff around where she isn't supposed to. This calms her down and walks better with it on.,5
Works as intended holds the carbon bags feel strong,4
"Fit and overall quality was less than expected, but it was inexpensive enough to keep rather than ship back at my expense...",3
Great for my Goldie as it prevent her from playing with water.,5
These are my dogs and cats favorite treats! It is nice to have something that I can give to both of them. Excellent product and all natural.,5
it turns on but does not heat excellent cust seervice,3
"If your piggies won't eat their daily C like mine won't, you gotta sneak it into the water!!!! LOVE THIS!!!",5
Great cage for my caique.  Follow the picture on the back of the box for assembly.  Snapped right together.  Pay attention to the fact that the top and bottom pannel must have the slide edges pointed down.,5
Way too small ! I'm using it under my cat's food bowls instead..very flimsy material also. I don't expect it to last for long but didn't want to take the time to return it so I used it for something. Would definitely NOT purchase it again or recommend.,1
Perfect for regulating a fish aquarium temperature.  Works excellently.,5
Great:),5
"This ball is made of really good quality material. It is hollow but hard rubber with a hole in it.  I have a dog that eats everything and this is indestructible.  The size in the picture is a little deceiving as it looks big, but it is about the size of a tennis ball or a little smaller. My dog loves it and I highly recommend it.",5
Kitten did not touch it. It smells horrible. He refused to take a single bite and I do not blame him!,1
"I got this for my cat to go on leashed walks with the family, of course a cat can only go so far....this is great nice and sturdy, and my cat loves it! I use it on sandy and bumpy dirt roads and it can be hard to handle on that surface, on pavement it is wonderful.",4
Good quality. Pleased with purchase.,5
These pet canisters are a good product.  They have a good appearance and look fine on the counter.  Keep dog treats and food fresh with their air tight seal.  I have several of these canisters in my home using them to keep dog treats.  As well as the larger canisters to hold dog food in my travel kit.  I would buy these products again.,5
Light clean scent,5
My little dog looks quite handsome in his sweater.,5
works no problem!,5
"Treats were shipped in a bubble envelope.  The package arrived flat as a pancake.  These are ""freeze dried"" bites of chicken meat.  Meaning that the treats will disintegrate into sawdust-like texture if treat bag is smashed.  No surprise that I received a package of smooshed up chicken dust.  My dogs deserve better!!  I don't mind spending the money for high quality treats, but will not buy this brand again.",2
Lasts a long time.,5
Buttercuts are the best in the business... 'Nuff said!,5
"I was excited when I got these, because it was such a pain to carry treats around on walks when I could just carry a pack of these lickity treats!

One of corgis will take a lick of the stick, then flip out and start trying to bite it. It takes a while for him to calm down, but he seems to love the taste of all the flavors.

My other corgi only seems to like the bacon flavor, and it is a struggle to get her to come up to the stick to lick it. She seems like she is scared of it.

At least I was a little confused by how the product worked, and if I had to squeeze  the bottle to get the liuquid out, but upon closer inspection the top is a rotating piece of plastic, When the dog licks the plastic, assumnig you are holding the bottle upside down, it will rotate the ball to where the other side has been dunked with some of the liquid. And this will continue as your dog licks.",4
"These would be good treats for a full grown dog, because they are rather hard. My puppy has difficulty chewing these, and it really slows down our training sessions.",2
Excellent,5
"I give one of these to my golden retriever once or twice a week.  It's just the right size for her to enjoy it for an hour or so, but not so big that she overeats (she'll work at any rawhide until it's gone).  She prefers the Dingo brand, and I like the higher quality.",4
My dog gets really cold in the winter.  He whines when he has played around and dislodged his blanket.  He does not like to be without it.  I like that when we go for walks this increases his visibility.,5
"I got the Medium/Large dog muzzle for my doberman, But it won't fit, it's running small, don't want to deal with the hassle to return it. waste of money, seller need to update the information on the breed recommendation page, it's not accurate.",1
"So I buy my cat a few different toys. Some wands, some electric, some vaguely shaped rodent dolls, and the all time classic ""Ball in a circle"". Some were expensive while others more manageable Like most cats they don't care how much love you show them through your hard earned cash and this toy here, at least in my cat's eyes, proves it. So I ask my cat ""Oh baby, how do you like your fancy electric toys""......ignores them. Whip out the stupid $2 wire with tiny cardboard tubes on the end and the cat jumps for joy and cries tears of happiness. She will go to her ""toy box"" and meow when it's playtime just so she can mess with this while the other toys go unused and unloved.

TLDR: My cat loves this more then any other toy that's 4x more expensive. My cat is the product user and rates it 5/5 stars.",5
"My Himalayan had problems every six months, went to the vet and took antibiotics.  Now, I sprinkle this on his food, he eats it, we're good to go.  If I stop using it for some reason, we go back to the same problems.",5
"The timeline went like this.  7:45 take new toy out and throw it.  Sails over fence.  It flies well, so don't toss it hard unless you have a huge area available and a good aim.  Spent next 5 min hunting thru the brush for it.  Got a couple of throws to the dog, then spent another 5 min hunting when it sailed over the fence again.  I think I got a lot more exercise than my dog did.  He did drop it in the pool and it did float, so that was good.  A few more throws and we came in (his choice;  standing at the doggy door with his new toy) at 8:00.  He carried it around for a bit and then he started to chew on it.  Within a few minutes he'd chewed through the ring on both sides.  Granted, he's a German Shepherd and a fairly strong chewer, but I still didn't expect it to be quite that fragile. When they say ""Leaving your pet alone with their floppy isn't recommended as prolonged and unsupervised chewing will damage the disc."", they are grossly understating it.  What they  should say is, ""Never leave your pet alone with their floppy because ANY chewing will destroy the disc.""  Still, if your dog isn't a chewer or you put it up immediately, it could be a fun toy.  For dogs who like to carry their new toys around, it isn't so good.",3
This is a great boredom buster for dogs AND cats! I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and they all get in on the fun when I swing the furry toy in a circle on the ground. They go crazy!! Glad I bought it and now I have to buy one for my daughters 3 cats:),5
Was fun ordering this food on line as we didn't have to carry it. Our cars love it!,5
"The default tennis ball that came in the launcher was demolished same day, my pup ate the fuzz off it. These are significantly more sturdy, and I love that one glows! It can be light up with artificial light, doesn't require real sunlight, but the glow will last longer if you use sunlight.",5
"My dogs have loved Pegetables for years, but because of the price we can only get them on special occasions. My chihuahua especially loves to chew through about half and save the remainder for later, haha. They are a great now-and-again treat, I wouldn't recommend giving them multiple times daily or daily for smaller dogs. But as a lazy day treat they are amazing!",5
"This is very lightweight, yet very powerful for its size. It came with extra sanding drums and the adjustment key. It has 2 speeds- High and Low. I would recommend using it on the low setting until your pet is accustomed to having his claws trimmed with a power tool. It's not very noisy, but it can be a bit scary the first time you get your claws ground down. I have hard wood floors and don't like the sound of clicking nails on it, so this keeps the claws short enough to not be pesky or do damage to the floors.",5
I love this was able to ship to Hawaii! Thank you! They are so expensive here starting at 275 for one smaller then this one. ...,5
Lulu looks pretty with it. Very good quality.,5
"Perfect for our bettas.  Not sure if they use them, but at least they have the option.",5
Little pricey compared to what I use to give her but then again she loves it so what can I say? She is old and finicky so this works and it is GRAIN FREE . It has cranberry in for bladder infections and veggies........ She scarfs it down!,5
"KITTY CRACK !!!  MY BABY KITTY LOVES THIS AND I FEEL GOOD FEEDING HER THIS HIGH QUALITY AMERICAN PRODUCT.
I KEEP IT IN THE FRIDGE TO KEEP CRUNCHY - HUMIDITY IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS.",5
Very cute.,4
Works pretty good,4
Its prefect for my 73lbs dog to use in the event of emergencies and days I get home a little later. I just put a large tray to make sure pee doesnt leak out of it! Its perfect! Great quality and soaks well!,5
"Overall, I like this, but it has a lot of room for improvement. The zippers are difficult, and feel cheap. The straps for the headrests are too far apart, by a lot. It's not waterproof; I find water and sand on my leather seat every time I remove it, and there are no holes in it. I can only assume it's going through the seat belt slot.",3
my bully breeds love it!,4
We love Geneflora!! Give this to all our four legged furry family daily!,5
Our veterinarian recommended this for our older dogs.  It was a little more reasonable buying it on Amazon!,5
it is great but I wish it had weather proof cloth around it so the puppies could be in it outside.....  I had to cover it with weather proof cloth,4
My yorkie looks so cute in these. Love them.,5
it is alright but smaller than the picture implies.,2
Holds up well even with fat cats. And of course cat loves it.,5
"I'd give this product 10 stars if I could!! Hands down the BEST cleaner I've ever used!! It works for everything! Nothing is better for pet messes. Even dried on poop. My dog hides and finds the most out of sight places to do her thing, so sometimes it's not found until it's dry and really stuck to the floor. This product is 100 times better than bleach or any other household cleaning product because I've tried them all!!!! I will be a customer for life and if you're reading this and unsure of which product to try, you will NOT be disappointed! It's like MAGIC!! P.S. I have linoleum flooring and tile/grout. I also bought Bubba's carpet shampoo and can't WAIT to try it!",5
"Fits perfectly, great price",5
Great.,5
Lots of room for our 40lb pup,5
Great product. My Pomeranian dog seems to like it.,5
Worked great.,5
Works well but bigger than I thought it was going to be,4
"It is very difficult to use but if you really try hard it will work as described.  I just find it too much, and found an easier way to clean the gravel.",3
"I've used the spray for years on an as needed basis to sooth tensions in a multi-cat household.  Our vet recommended the plug-in for calming a high-strung cat.  We put this on a timer so it's not running 24/7 to extend the length of use and it effectively settled our cat, making him more approachable and playful.",5
I like Zack and Zoey clothes for my dogs because they are true to size so was glad to find a light weight rain jacket for my boston mix. He likes it as he hates rain.,5
"This is the only one of the three I tried that the cats will actually use.  However, it's hard to make it challenging enough without it being too challenging so they get the treats out too easily.  Still the best I've tried.",5
My Westie loves this ---  Chicken  - but not the beef. Go figure,5
This collar is pretty flimsy and feels cheap. I bought it for a pretty costume so this does the trick. I wouldn't use it on a regular basis because I don't think it will hold up to heavy use.,3
Great jumbo litter box!! I just wish I could find the right linners that fit this large of a litter box.,5
Keep dog clean,5
So much nicer then the old ones that come with a lot of the tanks still.,5
"I haven't used it yet but I did put it together to make sure it was OK.  It was, but when i folded it back up, didn't fold up as nicely.  It is very heavy.",4
birds of mine are leary of new things thrust into their cage & wouldn`t come anywhere near it yet. it too0k them 4 months to accept a bird hut so the ladder may be o.k. after awhile.,3
"My cat, Orla, loves this and has already torn up one side! She doesn't really care for catnip so I don't put it on this ( I sprinkle it around cat tree for the other cat). I don't know what it is about this cardboard that cats like but it seems to be really good.",5
Excellent all around.,5
"Very cute, but did not fit properly as per measurements provided",2
Nice sturdy clippers.  Last a long time.,5
"I have an 8 year old Pug. She was constantly licking her legs and her skin always looked irritated so I tried switching her to a grain-free food and her itching stopped. She is generally a picky eater, but she loves this food. This is cheaper than buying at big pet stores and with Amazon Prime, it arrived in 2 days which was great. With the 24lb bag it lasts her several months. Will definitely buy again in the future.",5
Our cats love this flavor.,5
Cat loves it. Cheaper than the pet store by a mile.,5
Just what I needed,5
"I agree with the other reviewers, the concept is great, but my three cats didn't take to this at all.  I didn't take away their old litter box, fearing that with no alternative but this, they may go somewhere else and I'd be very unhappy.  The most that they did was walk through it.  I finally gave up.  I may try again, but I wonder if it would work if you used the cardboard separator and pellets in the regular plastic pan you already have?  I'm concerned about the box getting wet at the bottom, and what would happen if you picked it up and the bottom gave way!  The old plastic pan and litter you can readily purchase at the pet store seems the best way for us for now.",3
My birds love this basket,5
I love this.  It looks nice with the furniture and all our dogs use it; not just the old one ;),5
These bows are perfect! I bought these to use in our grooming salon and they just make these dogs look so darling -- especially the Maltese and poodles thay come around! The bows and rubber bands are both great quality and hold well -- I will definitely be purchasing these again!,5
"My kitties love this product! Easy to open with a pull tab, no ""meal"" in the ingredients. My cats go nuts at meal time!",5
Great for my dogs long hair.,5
My dog love this toy,5
"I absolutely adore this leash. My dog has a broad chest, so it's hard to fit harnesses to him, because he's also smaller (45-ish lbs). The Weiss Walkie has worked for us to communicate while walking (and thus preventing pulling), but the leash inevitably gets tangled up in his legs multiple times throughout a walk. This leash provides the same sensations, but the main point stays on his back and he never gets tangled in it. I appreciate that it's not hooked into his collar either, so it never pulls back on his neck.

Also, unlike the Weiss Walkie, this leash took the harness part into consideration with length. The leash (for my dog at least) is a regular length once on him. Another ""also"",  the rope is so soft and flexible (but super strong). It has to feel better to my dog, but it feels so much better on my hands. The colors are great, too!",5
"Fits great on our 96 lb. Akita. Quality made, easy to put on and well padded for comfort. Just purchased another one in a smaller size for our 55 lb. Husky. Now they can enjoy a safe ride in the convertible!",5
"A good little collar.  The release seems to have a nice balance--enough force necessary to pull it apart so the collar won't just fall off, but not so much it won't release the cat if there's a struggle.  The ordering process is a bit dicey if only because Amazon has a strict limit of lines and characters in their gift card messages, but it can be done.  The resulting embroidery had some odd spots (I think in the future I'd leave off the name and list only the contact info), but it'll still do what it's meant to.",4
Always good deal,5
"The shampoo has a very nice smell and I can watch the fleas fall out of the fur and die. I use it as a spray on my dog with short fur, and use maybe 80 ml for a real bath on my shepherd, because the spray is kinda hard to get into the long and thick fur. But it still works wonders: kills fleas, cleans the fur extremely well and I love the smell.",5
These collars are the best. I was always fearful of leaving collars on my two big mutts because of the stranglation hazard. But with these quality breakaway's I feel so much better about my pups wearing their collars / ID daily.,5
This great treat keeps my dog busy for a few minutes.,5
"I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet.  My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things!!  They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation.  My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles.  I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything, ha, but they are also great training aids.  I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too....so I guess that's antidotal but that's 5 dogs that really love the things!  Oh, the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet, about twice as much per pound, so this is a great buy.  Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up.  You won't run out of bones for a while and that's a good thing!",5
Excellent dog food and my dogs are getting leaner since they've been on it and they gets more food.  Both my dogs love the taste and I'm feeding it dry.,5
"Great I love it, I did not think my cats had that much hair.",5
I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned.,1
Zipper fell apart the first time I used it but the people at Pashion Direct were so helpful that if I needed to ever order another pet carrier I would definitely buy from them and so should you if you ever need one.,5
I have 2 small Chihuahuas & they love tug toys.  This is a well made product but not mini enough for their small mouths.  Good idea but they prefer small rope tugs.,4
I have a small backyard and the only area that had grass turned into nothing but dirt over time. I decided to hardscape my interior yard and provide an area for the dogs to poop. This became especially important after I inherited my Mother's dog who was not well trained and would pee and poop on the sidewalk instead of in the grass. It didn't  take long for him to start using the grass at least 80% of the time which is a vast improvement.,4
"Our cats adore this ""treat"".  Alas, we have fed them so much of it, they have grown a bit tired of it.  It is definitely expensive, but healthy for them.",5
"Product itself is a good value and good buy. We used it for indoor and got a big piece of wood cut to place under is so our bunny wouldn't pee or poop on our floor. It's pretty easy to put together, but there are little flaws in the wood so every now and again it's hard to get a screw through. Instructions aren't written in words step by step. They're illustrated. They're easy for my husband to follow, but not to myself. The smell of the wood was very pleasant when we took it out of the box. The coloring is a bit darker than the pictures. Top of roof is very rough and should hold up outside very nicely. It's a nice size for one rabbit, but I wouldn't put two in there. The enclosed house part (the 2nd level) comes slightly over my 2 year old daughters head. The enclosed wire part comes up to her chest and armpit. She's 35 inches tall. The inside of the house part has some little rod in it that we have no idea what it's for. The drawer is off kilter on the grooves/track it slides into. There's no way to hang the food or water in the housing part. You have to alter it yourself in order to do it. (Our bunny likes to knock over food and water if it's not hanging or up off the ground.)

The issue I had was I paid $50 extra for expedited shipping. They shipped the day before I was supposed to receive it. They used some crappy delivery service (OnTrac) who did not even attempt to deliver and marked it as the wrong address. We tried to contact the seller who took 24 hours to contact us back so we contacted Amazon who told us we needed to contact the seller. They assisted, but the seller basically said it wasn't their issue. They had mailed it out and I needed to contact the shipper. This shipper (OnTrac) is a well known horrendous delivery service. Only reason I actually got the package was because the van was driving up the street and I flagged the driver down. They weren't even going to stop at my house. There was also a signature required on the item for some dumb reason. We will never buy from this company again.",3
"Not only the orioles like this, but other larger birds do also.  I have some woodpeckers that come to drink several times a day, as well as my hummers.",5
This is great for training dogs to ring when they have to go!,5
"Really a well assembled puzzle that my dog can absolutely not destroy, HOWEVER, it was so simple she mastered it before I could even show her how.  Probably a good pre-k puzzle, but even a semi-smart dog will make you wish you bought a different puzzle.",4
"The silicone does not breathe and my dog begs me to rub her snout after we take it off. We don't let her wear it very long, so nothing in that duration of time should make her so uncomfortable. I got the right size and made sure it was loose, but my dog looks so unhappy and uncomfortable. Better to go with the unfashionable but reliable muzzles. Her eyes also water.",1
"Best harnesses. Got a medium for my 14lb shorkie and a medium for my 8 lb morkie. Fit well, good range on the adjustable strap. Also got a small for my other morkie, 5 lbs, and fits her well. Good quality harnesses.",5
"My dogs love them, but I think they're too pricey for the quick time they are eaten,",3

Broke after a few clicks.,2
Worthless. My 11 lb dog chewed a nub off in less than five minutes.,1
My dogs are in tennis ball heaven.,5

"Both our dogs love these Stuffingless Toys.  The puppy has worn out one of the squeakers from so much use, but overall satisfied with the construction and amusement level for the dogs!",5
Horrible. Would not recommend. I drilled holes into the pan so a TON of the litter would not be scopped up after turning the litter over and yet the litter was still wasted. Im considering drilling holes into the baracade wall that holds up the slide lever/ fecal collector. Will update.,1

No dust...love it,5
Good product.  Simplifies waste litter disposal.  I used to use plastic grocery bags. The Genie is better to contain the litter and odor.,5
"I was very happy how fast it came that is why I gave it 2 stars...The hay was very green, but very dry, and didn't smell sweet..All three of my Rabbits snubbed it..I was surprised that not one even tasted it..I guess it will go to my horse that will eat anything, but the most expensive couple of flakes I ever gave him. I had thought I ordered this before from this company because it came in a box, but after searching my old orders I made a mistake it was Standlee I actually ordered from,  and my Buns loved..I had forgotten because I've been giving my Bunns horse hay that has been good, but not lately..Thank goodness I checked past orders, because I didn't know where else to go, but a shame I wasted money on this order.",2
Great product. Bags do not tear and the scented ones cover the poo smell up well. Will continue to buy this brand.,5
These were okay.  They are much bigger than they look on Amazon. They also seem to move around on the floor so the cat was constantly spilling the water.  I wasn't happy with it and returned it.  Maybe for a different pet as they are nice looking and seemed to be made well.  Just not a good match for me and my cat.,3
"I use this for everyone; pets, livestock, myself, my kids. Wonderful stuff. I won't be without it.",5
"I ordered this in April, 2012 and have washed the cushion twice; I just took this out of the dryer and noticed that the cushion is coming apart.  I have a sanctuary for special needs cats, and I just don't have the time to sew up something I just received two months ago.  This is not a good product!",2
My one year old boxer chewed this toy open pretty quick. She is an aggressive chewer. Cute toy for a dog that is not a big chewer.,3
I like this bed.  I had the amazon basic version and this material is much nicer looking.  The large is bigger than my amazon large was.,4
"My cats had higher instances of throwing up when eating this food. My cat decided eating food that makes him throw up isn't worth it, so I stopped by this brand's wet food.  I still buy their dry as it seems to be okay for my cat.",1
Item came and works as described,5
"There's two main reasons why I like this flea comb. The first reason and most important is it doesn't have a handle. My cats for some reason when I approach them with a flea comb that has a handle on it they become freaked out and run away. This flea comb is small enough to fit in your hand and hide it from them, while approaching, then I begin to comb them with it, by the time they see the small comb they are relaxed by the experience  and accept the comb as something good.
The second reason is the metal teeth, they don't bend or break and last a long time.",5
Its a pretty big bag but my rat didn't like it. The pieces are a nice size for rats. Overall it was good but my ratty didn't like it,2
Always a winner with the dogs,5
I actually got my cats to use this in one of those hard-to-get-to places where they were sneek-peeing...the grass gets all turned around as they are relentless scratchers...but it better than crawling under the desk with the carpet cleaning hose thing.,4
Too expensive,3
always used,5
Dogs love them. Good for their teeth.,4
"just wish my dog would use it. i got this for my patio, but my little maltese refuses to use it.",5
"I've tried every version they offer in this line of toys - and my other reviews stand as they are, however, I've found that the Kitty is the LEAST DURABLE in the entire line - I DO NOT recommend this - please look at the cow and the hedgehog - those really last. My puppy can destroy this thing in 10 minutes - and he's a 7 pound Chihuahua!",5
Just a note to other basking animal parents: I've been told that the UVB on these bulbs and other UV bulbs needs to be checked after a couple of months to make sure it's still producing the rays your critter needs.  I haven't found a tester that I can afford yet most are several $100. Hope to find something soon in the time being I just change my bulbs every couple of months and keep an extra on hand.  This price makes that possible!,5
We took out about a third of the stuffing and are reserving it for when the bed gets flat. Our two greyounds love these and settle right down on them in the motor home. And they look good too!,5
"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the pressed layers are thinner than I'd hoped, so they didn't last as long as other pressed rawhide I've purchased. The dogs (they're large breed with strong jaws) peeled them apart pretty quickly. But the dog definitely enjoyed them.",4
"Great idea for smaller dogs.  Not only does it allow them to sit high enough to see outside, but keeps them secure.  The only issue is the top border which contains the structural metal rail.  Wish it could be cushioned so dogs could comfortably lay their head on it during longer trips.  If not for this, would have given 5 stars.",4
"Great product, my dogs love the different flavores n easy to serve. No smelly odors good smells. Have used for very long time",5
"Initially purchased this for use with cat food, but quickly realized they work great on people food too. Often I'll want half a can a spaghetti sauce and then I'm stuck with half a can of spaghetti sauce, with no lid, just sitting in the fridge...

These work with both large and small can and create a fairly strong seal.

Will likely buy again.",5
"Not as good as i thought it would be. Says it is super sharp but it really isn't. It more pulls vs. helps seamlessly comb through dense cat hair, but would work on a cat that isn't matted.",3
"This Large Elk rack piece has lasted longer than most.  All the dogs love it.  I run a rescue for mostly large and extra large mixed breed dogs and they all have enjoyed this!  Mixed into my group is a 7# stray who refuses to be adopted and even this little guy enjoys chewing on this.

No sticky residue or mess, and does not splinter.  None of the dogs experienced any vomiting or diarrhea and there was no bad breath from it.  I recommend this over rawhide chews and natural bleached bones.  Yes they are pricey but for me, well worth the cost.",5
"the large weird chicken pieces are like rubber...I cut them into small pieces so my Lhasa doesn't choke...my dogs like it but doesn't seem like chicken to me and there is like 7 pieces of string bean, no carrots or peas that I saw and gravy...I don't think I will buy again even though I got 8 for half the price at stop & shop.",3
"I have a large icrate with a divider panel.  I do love this crate, however the hooks and edges are very sharp.  Today I took the divider panel out so I could collapse the crate to give to friend who is watching my puppy while I'm out of town.  I leaned the panel against the bedroom door and my puppy came up to investigate.  As she backed up, a hook went COMPLETELY THROUGH HER EYELID.  After a couple seconds of her screaming in pain I managed to get her calm enough to carefully slide the hook back out and rush her to the vet.  Fortunately the hook did not injure her eye but she has a bloody gash in her eyelid and it's very swollen.  She's going to have to be on antibiotics for the next week.  Vet visit cost $120, half of which was for the emergency status of the visit and the other half for the antibiotics.  The hooks need to be rounded off or filed down.",3
"My wife and I have a 25lb whippet-shepherd mix who really likes to chew, and is rather smart by dog standards. These two characteristics often don't mix well, which has led us on a search for the best of the best puzzle chew toys. I would like to thank Kyjen for sending me a copy of this toy in exchange for an honest review!

As soon as I took this out of the package and our pup smelled rawhide, her little tail started to wag! It's one of her favorite things, and despite there being a relatively small amount of rawhide strung on to the bone, it didn't take away from her butt wriggling in excitement!

BUILD/QUALITY
Well, it's nice to see that this is made of natural rubber. Not only does it have that nice vanilla-like smell, but you also don't have to worry about your dog swallowing potentially-toxic pieces of their toys! Now, I want to refer back to the title of my review in reference to the quality and how long this will last your dog. If your dog is an indiscriminate chewer, you will probably see pieces of the rubber coming off eventually. It's not because this isn't made of durable, high-quality rubber, but simply because there are holes for the rawhide to be threaded making it easier to bite a piece off. Luckily, our pup was MUCH more interested in the rawhide than the rubber, and after two chewing sessions and some fetch in the living room it looks no worse for wear. The toy comes with a refill, which was appreciated.

FUN/DIFFICULTY
I wouldn't call this a difficult puzzle toy - there are no moving parts or hidden compartments like some of Kyjen's other toys, but the fact that it's not just a piece of rawhide really kept our dog interested. I would say it took about half an hour for her to get all the rawhide off and eaten, which is not bad for her! That said, she is only 25lbs, so your mileage really will vary. She had a great time standing on the bone while tugging at the rawhide!

REFILLING
Now, something that might be too much hassle for some is refilling the bone. According to the directions you soak the rawhide strips in warm water for five minutes, thread them through the bone, and then leave it to harden (around 12-24hrs depending on conditions). It's not the simplest of systems, but given how much our pup enjoys this toy I can't say that I mind it too much - I plopped it in a glass of hot water while doing some dishes and it was ready to thread in 5 minutes. The refills are available here on Amazon, and will run you about $1 per strip. Compared to the refills for our&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everlasting-Large-Bento-Ball/dp/B000X2RUX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everlasting Large Bento Ball</a>&nbsp;(three and half dollars each) which last her about an hour and a half, the cost/time ratio seems about right!

- There is a piece of paper with a warning wrapped in each refill - don't forget to remove it before soaking them (I didn't notice until soggy!)
- The instructions tell you cut off excess rawhide, but I just double threaded which didn't seem to be an issue.
- The holes are numbered for easy restringing - I would suggest looping around number 1 so that it is held in place by tension!

OVERALL
There are several reviews on here from owners of heavy chewers that just didn't find that the toy lasted for their dogs - and I have no doubt they are reporting their honest experiences. I also have to be very honest and say that my dog really enjoys this toy and it keeps her busy! I would probably rate this at 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed it - the refill process is a little bit of a hassle - but as a standalone product it really is one of the better easy puzzle toys out there for a moderate chewer. Amazon's star rating defines five stars as ""I love it"", and four stars as ""I like it"" - I'm definitely right in between those two ratings! I would HIGHLY suggest buying a size bigger than you normally would - despite being only 25lbs our dog is long and skinny (medium-sized) and I think the large bone keeps her busy for longer then a medium bone would! My wife and I wouldn't call this the answer to our puzzle toy search, but it's definitely good to keep a moderate chewer busy for a decent amount of time! Definitely recommended depending on the dog!",4

The collar requires some assembly upon receipt which is fairly easy to do.  Included in the box is: 1 vibration device, 1 battery, 1 adjustable strap, 2 Sets of Contact Posts, and Instruction Booklet.

I have three short haired dachshunds, one of which barks at any and everything.  I had previously purchased a shock collar after some recommendations from other pet owners but after I received it and tested it on myself I immediately knew I wouldn't be placing it anywhere near my dog let alone around his neck.  This collar is much different and corrects the dog with audible tones first as a warning which is then followed by vibration if they continue to bark.  There are 7 different sensitivity levels to choose from allowing you to find the lowest one for your dogs comfort.

To assemble the collar you first want to choose which size contact posts you want to use, longer for long haired dogs and shorter for short haired dogs.  After you choose the correct post twist them onto the screws on the back of the unit.  Next install the battery included into the battery door located on the front of the device.  When the battery is installed correctly you will then hear a beeping sound.  Now you are ready to fit the collar to your dogs neck size for a comfortable fit with room to adjust if needed, you don't want the contact posts to dig into your dogs skin rather just sit against his/her coat.  After you find the right fit and feed it through the strap closure you can cut off the excess fabric and I recommend taking a flame along the cut to harden it and keep it from fraying on you.

Once you assemble the collar you will want to experiment with the sensitivity settings if it doesn't seem to startle your dog on the default setting which is four.  The collar should give off a vibration that your pet will begin to realize is due to his/her barking.  My dog seemed to quickly grasp that the unwanted vibration he felt only came after he barked and was a result of the collar.  He would stop barking at just the sight of the collar when I would grab it to put it on him.  He could care less about the audible alert tone but didn't like the vibration and would stop barking immediately.  The collar is made of good quality and even has a reflective stitching on it to keep safe at night.  It is not recommended to use the collar for extended periods of time.  I personally believe that it is good to train your dog not to excessively bark while still allowing them their natural instinct to bark.

I personally haven't experienced any false corrections by the collar to date and will update if my opinions of this collar or its overall performance change negatively in any way.  I have seen a positive change in my dogs barking habits and hope to continue the welcomed results through corrective training.  I received this item free in exchange for my honest unbiased review.  All opinions are 100% my own.  If you have any questions please feel free to comment below and I will do my best to answer them for you.",5
I like buying my dog stuff in bulk but my dogs weren't as excited to eat these.,3
good bird toy,4
"I currently use two of these in my 65 gallon. I am so impressed by how clean they keep it, that I decided to purchase one for my 30 gallon. Works better than expected. Well worth the price!",5
cute,5
Don't let anyone tell you it doesn't work. Give it too the cats on schedule. If they scratch the next day or work at rubbing the back of neck then they are allergic to it. It works fine on our cats. It just needs to dry a little cause getting wet ticks my kitty off.,5
"My dog loves them. I give them to her as a special treat she can't wait. As to the tooth brush affect I'm not sure how good a job it does, but its better than nothing. My dog is a big girl about 85 lbs. It takes her no time to chomp down one of the large sticks.",5
A 6 on a scale of 1-5 this harness goes above and beyond. The size is perfect. It's very minimal when it comes to harnesses this one doesn't effect the dogs gate and it is front hook so the dog can't pull if it does it's redirected to the handler.,5
cool,5
"SEACHEM is always awesome, GREAT honest products, always do EXACTLY what they are supposed to, in my opinion SEACHEM IS THE BEST AQUATIC SUPPLIMENT PRODUCT AVAILABLE, always a fair price for what you get per bottle/item, A++

I've been a successful planted aquarium/fish keeper for years, SEACHEM is simply the best there is, period.",5
This filter is too perfect it juat works. wouldnt run a tank without one!,5
These work wonders for our kitties.,5
Our two cats are thrilled to be playing inside and on top of the cat condo.  We can hear them playing in and on the condo almost all day and all night.  We chose the Large size as our cats love to cuddle together and they can be found together in the second from the top level by looking inside (the hole is on the side on that level).  The heavy canvas is perfect for allowing them to climb to the top along the outside of the condo too. The cat condo fits perfectly on the door and once all the straps are in place is very secure.  We have already recommended this cat condo to all of our friends who are owned by felines.,5
Really like this product for it's durability and strength.  The cat liners are large and roomy to fit Momma Kitty's litter box and holds a lot of litter.  the draw-strings make for easy clean up.,4
As soon as I pulled it out of the box and threw it on the floor my dog jumped on it and got comfy!,5
"It mostly works. It did help prevent the dog from going on the counter and bark at first, but it seems that the dog developed tolerance and is now more than often ignoring it.",4
My dog loves this!! Great purchase. It has survivied a long time!,5
My guinea pig likes this food,5
"I love this and my ratties love it. It's dust free, they don't sneeze anymore, and it doesn't get everywhere.  Also, the bag is huge!

Using this alone I need to completely change their bedding and clean their cages about every 5 days. However, if you use a layer of litter underneath to help with odor control, it lasts awhile  longer. I recommend ""fibrecycle"" :)",5
Exactly as described and has worked wonders on training our new rescued cat and straightened out a few of the neighbors cats as well.,4
"I just got a new car and this product was great. I have a 2006 Lexus GS300 and it was very easy to install and fit great. It kept the dog hair off of my leather seats as well as protecting them from nail marks and scratches. This is water proof but does have holes for the seat belts where the water could leak through. It comes off quickly and easily to just throw in the wash when needed.  I was also able to easily attached Mopar's doggie car seat with the seat cover in place. As a bonus, my niece's car seat attaches easily and protects my seats from her messed too.

This product is definitely a great buy at this price and I would recommend it to both dog owner and anyone with children as well. The material is very sturdy and should hold up well. This looks like it would also be a lifesaver for activities where you might be getting in the car damp, dirty or excessively sweaty.",5
Love this product for my 70-ish pound rescue mutt. It allows me to pull her whole head in the direction I want her to go rather than pulling on her neck alone. Wonderful product! Definitely recommend.,5
my dog loves this ball.  it's his favorite.  I like it too because it's really bouncy so I don't have to throw it that far but it will bounce a lot farther.  It also works well with the chuck-it.  The ball has a hole on the side and whistles a little when you use the chuckit.  Not hard so I don't worry about it wearing down my dog's teeth as much.,5
Very durable. My German Shepherd loves it. Easy to throw and easy for her to pick up. She hasn't tried to chewed it up.,5
"I have a ten year old dachshund and the moment of changing her to this food, she became her younger self again. I noticed increase in energy, happiness, and her coat feels amazingly softer. Diet is so important in senior dogs and this was really such a good switch for my fur baby. Would highly recommend this to anyone researching to find a good food for their senior dog",5
My dog is old and is losing her hearing.  She can hear me clap loudly so thought maybe a high pitched whistle would help get her attention but doesn't seem to help.,3
"I like to have a jar of Viralys on hand, as I do rescue and foster work.  Often a kitty will have a cold or is a little sneezy from being at the shelters before we get to them, and just 1 scoop in canned food at mealtimes usually suffices to dry up whatever virus they have.  Also, I have a Persian cat who has herpes of the eye, which gives him the 'goopy-eyed' look so common to cats whose tear ducts are malformed.  Using Viralys keeps it in check, so he's much more comfortable.",4
My dog loves it he normally chews them up hasn't with this one yet weve had it for about a month now,5
Good Brush for a Short Hair German Shepherd - The plastic prptector is more of a pain than it is worth.  Doesn't work well for my long coat shepherd. I will keep it!,4
"I have had this harness for maybe 2-3 months at the most. My dog is great off leash so he rarely has to wear it. But, it's already falling apart, and I have no option to return and get a new one :-( Very unhappy",1
My guinea pigs love these bristles. They get more entertainment from pulling out individual strands than chewing them so they don't last long before falling apart. I wish they were woven together on one end so it wasn't destroyed in 10 minutes.,3
I like these because they are thing and I can cut up or tear apart for portion control!,5
Perfect,5
I purchased this reptile habitat/platform for our bearded dragon.  When it came i noticed it was a little too small for our beardie.  It is made of solid material and looks great and natural in the cage.  When it gets dirty just wash with warm water and soap and disinfect.  I would recommend this product but not if your beardie or reptile is large.  Best for smaller reptiles I would think.,4
"I have a new cat i rescued and he had terrible bumps on him under his coat. The vet gave me 30.00 medicine that really didn't do much.
  So i looked on here and this is one of the products i found on here. He is now bump free and doesnt just sit and itch all the time",5
Durascale 10 my ass,1
"If you buy this toy for your dog, you will laugh when you hear the noise it makes. It chuckles like a little kid. After two days of this constant inane chuckling you will want to find the toy's maker and strangle him. (ditto for the screeching monkey made by the same company). But annoying as it may get (and it can be quite intense!), it's a great toy, my dog loves it and the damn squeaker seems to be indestructible.",5
"My 2 year old Lab/Pitbull (40lb) mix loves to chew, and she is not picky. But for some reason she doesnt like this bone. So if your dog is picky, might be best to avoid this one.",3
"We have a really finicky Boston Terrier that normally puts his nose up to any treat let alone normal dog food.  I didn't expect him to like these.  At first he did his normal thing and put his nose up and left it lye on the floor as you can see in the picture.  I walked away and within about 5 minutes he decided to give it a try.  The results were he spent the next ten minutes working on the Greenie till it was completely gone.  This is a dog that won't chew anything else.  No bones, milk bones or any type of chew treat.  He normally has dog breath that isn't nice to be around.  I have to say it is much better since he started using Greenies.  I love that these are Grain-Free.  Our terrier doesn't handle grain well.

Bottom line, these are nothing like the original Greenies of days past.  These are loved by our Boston Terrier and they do improve his breath and his teeth look brighter.  They cost a little more than other like products but the petite size is perfect and last a long time as we only give our guy one a day.",5
Fits my dachshund (standard) perfectly! He is 30lbs so a size large was perfect.,5
My Blue and Gold Macaw loves sitting in the sun playing on this thing. It holds up pretty well against a strong beak and seems thick enough for my birds to get good grips on.,5
"At the suggestion of my Avian doc, I got this for my cockatiel and indian ringneck.  I mix this with zupreem fruit blend and zupreem natural pellets.  My babies took to the mix immediately!  They love it.

My doc feeds all of these pellets (with the zupreems I mentioned) for his senagal who has been feasting on this blend for 30 years and has stayed in perfect health!  I figured, if it's great for my docs parrot, it's great for mine.  Proof is in the pudding, they Love it :)  and I love it because I know no matter what they eat from in the mix, they are getting ALL of the nutrition their little bodies need to stay at optimal health and beauty :)",5
"Took awhile for my Italian Greyhound to even create a rip in this guy. I know, small dog, but she's got quite a set of teeth and destroys toys pretty quickly. This one has held out well and only in the last week or so has the stuffing started to show. I'm used to stitching up her toys, but the fact that this has lasted since Christmas rather than just a few weeks is mighty impressive.

Oh, but she did destroy the squeaker quickly. But those never last more than a few days in my experience and is a given.",5
Cheap product that is supported by horrible customer service. This broke and we use LIGHTWEIGHT cat litter.,1
dogs hated then,1
I don't know whether it helps my beagle not to pull as much. Even though she does still but not as much as before. The nice thing about this is that it has lifetime guarantee. So the first one I have the cloth over the harness torn a bit and the clip to secure the harness broke after a year. I emailed them with the picture and they immediately send me a replacement. They stand by their words and I find very little customer service that easy to deal with for a replacement. 4-star instead of 5 because I really can't tell whether it is by training or with the harness that my beagle pulls less. She can get really stubborn and will pull by nature when there is food she sees (don't think any harness can take that beagle instinct away!) but she never got loose on this harness and that is what I care about. The new one is working well still.,4
"This is one of my dogs favorite toys. He'll come up to someone with it in his mouth and swing his head so the bottome of the rope falls into your lap. If you don't take it he'll try one more time and if no response he'll move onto someone else. Its to cute. Me personally Im not a fan of it, but thats just because my dogs strong as hell and he loves to yank it as hard as he can. Im more into the fetch game. But my husky absolutly loves it and its holding up great. He destroys everything he owns within a few weeks and this one is really holding up.",5
"It was a whole lot smaller than I anticipated, but I really just wanted it for a sort of ""front yard"" fence for my rabbit.  He's an inside rabbit, and I wanted to give him some extra room, so I just removed the door and attached this via wire.  If I was using as intended, I wouldn't want to put anything bigger than a young Guinea pig - an adult would have little room to play in this play pen.  I guess it'd be good to put anything smaller than a puppy while you're cleaning your animal's cage.

Definitely not for ferrets in any manner.

It does NOT come with the mat (but making your own out of canvas and a waterproof spray or paint - non-toxic of course - would be better and cheaper).

I would NOT keep my rabbit in this for longer than it takes to clean his cage - I don't anyway because he is fine with just hanging out at my feet.

For those who want to know, I have a Netherland Dwarf rabbit",4
"What can I say, they work! On two different size cans!",5
I bought this for my parrotlet. Since I placed it in his cage he sits beside it all the time. He keeps looking at his reflection in mirror. What I didn't like is the reflecting film. It scratches easily and becomes dull as time passes but it is great for the price.,4
"These float, so my fish that usually hang out at the top don't have to fight with bottom feeders for the sinking pellets.",5
"i don't know how everyone else is feeling about it, but my dog doesnt like it, and doesnt play with the kong device when this is inside",1
We've had this bed since the beginning and it's been great.  I wash the cover often and it has held up just great.  Fits our cheap-o crate just perfectly.,5
"Our cat loves these balls. She bats them around, and they are soft enough that she can pick them up and carry them around. She plays with them by the hour. She is a 2-year old cat, and we have been frustrated on finding toys she will play with. Until now, she was only interested in the laser beam. Now, she has something new that completely occupies her for a period of time.",5
Nice looking. Extra large so my Maine Coons are more than comfortable in it. A little difficult to put together but my husband got it done in about 45 mins.,5
"My two cats love these treats, and at five and ten years they are showing their own signs of aging. The elder cat has problems jumping onto and off of the bed, while the younger one has been playing less and sleeping more (lazy buggers!). The treats did seem to perk them up a bit, but there are still issues of getting up and down from furniture for the old guy. They both are playing more, but other than energy levels I don't see much improvement in mobility.",3
very pleased,5
I only buy KONG for our Newfies.  I was really disappointed in this squeaker bone; it lasted about ten minutes.  Will not buy again,1
"I like the ingredients for the most part, I do think it has a little too much vegetables but I can overlook that because the ingredients seem wholesome and it is sourced and made in the US, I find it very important that the ingredients and the manufacturing isn't imported. I feel there are more and better regulations in this country than others. I like that there isn't any corn in this and would be good for dogs that have allergies to some grains. The kibble is small and good for most sizes of dogs too. I am pleased with this dog food and I am glad I was able to try this.
My dog likes this but as with all foods you must start off mixing a little bit at a time into there regular dogfood because you can upset their whole system by changing too quickly. I give this food a thumbs up and as long as it is kept in stock so there is no problem ordering and the price doesn't rise suddenly like some others.",4
"Our puppy is so tall he was either laying down to eat or had to spread his front feet so wide it looked painful. This has really made it comfortable for his meal times. It was inexpensive, but it looks nice and seems to be very solid. The bowls are a decent size... not too big and not to small, even for our Pyrenees mix.",5
works great in my 54 gal freshwater aquarium. I use regularly and all fishes are beaming away,5
"My dogs ate this for about six or seven months.  I think it's a decent food but they became very gassy, their stools were loose and extremely smelly long after switching to this.  I put them on a different food and digestive issues immediately cleared up and haven't come back since.  Don't think I'll be using this brand again but ingredient wise - it's still a pretty good food.",3
"I have a small dog that was diagnosed with Kidney disease in September, she is very young so hearing the news broke my heart. She wont' be two until April 2015. My vet is certain she was born with Kidney problems, and I am going to assume he is right. Her illness came on suddenly and I honestly thought she was going to die. She also had a bald spot that just appeared on her back between her shoulder blades about 6 months before she got sick ( I don't know if this was a side effect of kidney problems or not)  her BUN levels measured 130 (25 being the high normal) and her creatinine levels were 7.4 (1.0-1.1 is normal) after three weeks taking a combination of Epakitin twice a day and Azodyl twice a day, her BUN has dropped 30 points (my vet also told me that in time the numbers should go down even more) and her creatinine is 1.1 and she acts like she has never been sick.. also her bald spot on her back has also filled back in with hair. I honestly don't know if the bald spot has anything at all to do with her kidney problems but it seems very odd to me that her hair has come back.. she is cream colored and  bald spot is brown now..lol..  I have read so many reviews on this product not being as good as they claim, my experience is.. this product along with Azodyl has saved my sweet little dogs life and she will be on it for the rest of her life as far as I am concerned.",5
Very competitive price and delivered.,5
Good price only they weren't very thick.,5
"Very disappointed in this ""invisible tough"" toy.  I rarely write reviews, but we were so dissatisfied with the claims of this toy and reality.
A one year old welsh corgi that loves to chew.  This has easy to chew outer casing that was chewed off within 15 minutes.  The inner covering didn't last much longer either.
Very disappointing.",1
"It is wobbly, unstable, and lip-sided. It falls often, especially if you have carpeted floors. The adjustable neck always ends up slouching over. It doesn't serve its intended function and is a safety concern. If this thing falls over when you aren't home, it could easy start a fire because the bulb is exposed meaning it can break or make contact with whatever it lands on. Buy the bulb but use it with a different lamp.",1
Purchased to prevent the dog from jumping up on the window.  Just placed on floor in front of window and no more jumping.,5
Great for my kitten. He loves it too!,5
"This did not do anything to stop our dog from barking. We could tell she could hear/sense it, but it didn't help at all.",2
Fit somewhat snug. Very stiff material.,3
"So far this undercoat brush is doing what it promised. Have an Old English Sheepdog and the hair keeps on coming with this rake.
Thank for a great product.",5
Wish it adjusted to be much shorter.  It is too long to keep them in one spot.,3
"I only give it a 1 star rating because, I never got to use it. It arrived with the spray cap broken and the liquid leaked out. The box itself, smelt great!",1
"Excellent product, we are still in the winter here in Washington State, I can see just by looking at the quality of this mask, my mini horse will be a happy little girl when the fly season hits, great stuff, highly recommend this company and all of it's products!",5
"Love these rings. My schnauzer is going on three and has the prettiest white teeth still. He seems to know what these rings are for. As soon as he eats, he will find it and chew on it for a good 15 minutes. He does this after every meal and it is not something I taught him to do.",5
Birds loved it. I liked the size.,5
Great option for those of us who don't want to order a second tag. This clip makes it easy to switch a tag from one collar to another.,4
my pup loves his new kong ! we put treats inside and he plays for ages with it,5
My little girl looks so sweet in it! Thank you!,5
The cats were too lazy to play with this.  Bought as a gift and they just sit and stare at it.,3
"Best stuff you can bath your dog with, and a pleasant smell as well.",5
Works great!,5
"Used to transport a hard-to-load horse all thw way across.country. Really helped. Not a complete cure of.course, but I am sure it would have been a lot.harder without the stuff. Just follow instructions and make sure you give to horse 30 to 45 minutes BEFORE your horse's traumatic event. Once they are upset, product not.likely to help.",5
"I was looking for cat poop all over the house, it turns out this smells like cat poop.  Cat wouldn't eat it either.",1
Great dog food. Great price on Amazon. Has helped my Yorkie with his skin allergies. No questionable ingredients.,5
"This is my 3rd one, had 2 for years for my labs (with the extenders) and got a 3rd when we started fostering. Keeps food and water in (minus head turns and drips), super easy to wipe clean and I think my dogs like the high sides so they don't feel like their food is open to the other dogs taking.",5
works great,5
This toy is fantastic!  It keeps my dog busy and intellectually stimulated.  Dogs can do so much more than play fetch.  It is made up of a hard plastic that probably won't be attractive to your dog as a chewing toy.  Very durable.  Love this toy!,5
"Can make the difference between a horse that colics from not drinking enough in cold weather and one that doesn't.

These buckets are a very good value.",5
Dogs love these,5
"After adopting two cats from the shelter I went through several different litter boxes, trying to find the right one.  This makes cleaning the box super easy.  You don't have to scoop stuff out, only roll it and use the drawer.",5
Great design. My cats 10lb bag of cat food fits perfectly inside. It snaps shut and keeps the food fresh. And the spout and handles make serving food easy.,5
Not bad but the harness strap buckles are stiff and hard to clip and while there is a trash bag dispenser there is no real pocket for the tissue I use to pick up my dogs droppings.,3
"Great pet tags!  Not sure how/why anyone is having problems w/ these things.  Worked perfectly on an oval rabies tag, and a large circle ID tag.  Just really tight when putting them around the tags, but that'll make sure they stay on!  Our dog is in ""ninja mode"", now...can't hear the tags clanking, anymore.  Just what we were looking for.  :)",5
"It's the second time I'm ordering them from Amazon because I'm paying less than half what my local RadioShack charges for the exact same item. Of course, prices go up and down so be careful and make sure you bundle it with something else so you get free shipping.

Note that the exact same product is offered by other merchants through Amazon at what may appear to be lower prices. However, they charge for shipping and you may end up paying a lot more that you would if you ordered from Amazon in a 'free shipping' bundle.",5
This is an excellent harness.  We have ordered four and couldn't be more pleased.  They are very easy to put on the dogs.  They are cool and the dogs love them.,5
"Knowing my picky cat, I bought a single can of this at the pet store and I am very glad I did.  While I thought it was a pretty good food, Abigail did not.  She would barely even lick it so I ended up tossing the single can and crossed it off my list of ""efforts"" on her behalf.  Too bad though because I liked the way it had some smaller pieces of fish rather than the huge chunks that can be a problem for some cats.  Even if she would have liked it though I probably would have only used it sparingly because of the guar gum and potato starch. If your cat is having digestive problems, look up guar gum on line.  A terrible additive to our kitties diets!",5
15 week old gsd loves it!,5
My cat did not like this wet food too much. But he did like the dry food I got for this brand.,2
What can you say about a tube...This DEFINATELY should have come with the kit! The standard tube is way too short to be useful unless you like swimming in your tank every time you filter your gravel.,3
Best house I have found for bunnis and groups of guinea pigs. Sturdy. Flat on top. Not tippy. I run a petting zoo and have ALOT of bunnies and guina pigs. This is the BEST.,5
"This was a great purchase for my dog! I had recently purchased a cheaper harness from Walmart and she began scratching at it because the buckles would rub against her skin. With this harness, she has a more smooth harness that doesn't bother her. The mesh is also really soft and doesn't hurt her when she pulls! It's also great because it's easy to wash. I would definitely purchase again.
My dog is a pug/chihuahua mix and she fit in a medium comfortably with extra room left if she were to ever gain weight or get bigger.",5
This was worth the money! I just groomed my short haired cat whom has been wearing a cone and unable to clean himself for about two weeks and after using these gloves he is all shiny and silky again! These remove a lot of shedding fur and seem therapeutic to stressed animals!,5
"One of my dog loves these. The other is too lazy to chew them, so he waits for his canine friend to soften one up and then steals it from him.

If they're too hard for your dog, you can also boil them in hot water. That softens them up perfectly.",5
"Last month I had to make an unfortunate trip to visit my ill father from Florida to Philadelphia and wanted to leave my cat with the vet for 10 days. However, it was much more expensive than taking him with me on a flight.

I was worried that he would not get used to the disposable litter box at my parent's house and that he would start to do his business everywhere, but once I setup this litter, he jumped on it and we never got ANY smelly surprises, even thought the cat litter was setup IN the kitchen (well...other than the Hispanic food makes the environment 'smells'...ie. rice and beans, alcapurrias, etc.).  Although, I did sprayed the carrier and around my parent's house with the Feliway Behavior Modifier Spray.

I hate scooping!

So I have been using the Scoopfree for a year and is the best invention ever (after the holidays), so I don't scoop the litter every day.  Now, with this litter, I don not scoop for 3 days and yet, even with my family's Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's sense of smell, we still had no cat=pee=ewwwk odors...

Now we are about to make another trip because of the deteriorating health of my dad,and I want to take him with me again, because my family loves him and brings them joy in these sad times.  That is why I, even if the price here in Amazon is waaay to high for a litter (twice as much as other sites I found), I would pay for it so I'm reassured that my baby-kitty will be comfortable to relief himself on the road or once we reach our destiny...BECAUSE HE DESERVES IT.",5
These help my youngest cat stay regular. I know TMI. ;),5
"keeps the dog out, litter contained. Perfect!",5
great value for the money!,5
Product as described,5
Dog loves it,5
"Very tough rubber. Sturdy for a good chew but I find it hard to want to stick peanut butter or any treat that is not dry in it bc really...how is the inside going to get cleaned? The sticky food sticks to the inside, crap starts growing or it just attracts ants and bugs...",3
I have a Champion French Mastiff (very large dog) so of course i wanted a quality large leather collar. Well this collar was everything i was hoping to get and it is gorgeous. Quality of leather is amazing and my pup looks awesome .I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you,5
"I think our German Shepherd had 3 separate ones of these toys. The first we got him when he came home, at 10 weeks, and that lasted a couple months. Then the second lasted a little less long. And the third got torn up pretty quickly as he was about 7 months old. We decided not to get him any more since they just couldn't stand up to his teeth but we highly recommend them for under 6 month old chewers or any age of non-chewer.",5
There item was great. But I get it for 99 cents at the dollar store. Same size. I thought this was going to be a huge container due to price.,2
"good quality , bird loves it.",5
Very nice product. Perfectly fits the ramps of my guinea pig cage. Very comfortable for our piggies to climb up and come down.,5
"followed the instructions but like some of the comments, the ice cream became too hard (really hard) to scoop out. My cockapoo loves it though.",2
My dogs love these.,5
My chinchilla loves it!,5
"I recently adopted a rescue pup (6 months old--caged her whole short life) who was in bad shape. Stools often bloody and often loose. Besides getting her on to grain free food my other dogs eat, I supplemented her with this probiotic. It has been 4 weeks now and her stools have firmed up considerably. Good diet, good supplements, just what she needed. I will continue to supplement her with this as she seems to have digestive sensitivities that my other dogs don't. maybe that's the nature of the beast when the dog has been so poorly treated, I don't know but it is nice to see her become healthy before my eyes :-) This is a good supplement.",5
"So I bought this because we use regular pet nail clippers which often leave sharp edges on my dogs nails. Tried it out, one of my dogs didn't mind it and the other two want nothing to do with it. It isn't as quiet as I want but it isn't too loud either...I like that it has a cap and the openings for the nails are a good size. I am going to try and keep training my dogs to recognize this as a good thing and to not freak out because as soon as I try and touch their nails with it, they pull away. And mind you, they usually let me cut their nails with the regular clippers so I think just because it is a new (and noisy) object is why they don't like it. My dogs range from 45-60 lbs and they have pretty thick nails. After using it with one of my dogs, her nails were nice and smooth which is what I want so I will continue to keep getting them all familiar with it so they can all have smooth and perfect nails!",4
"So glad I found this product! My dog is getting old. She needs something soft to sleep on. Finding something that worked outside was a challenge. This dog duvet is very well made and a steal for the price! I've only had it a few days, so I can't attest to durability yet, but I don't expect any problems. The craftsmanship is top rate.",5
Cat likes it.,4
my dog likes her dress.,5
"Works the way it should, seems sturdy tho maybe a big dog could ruin easily enough. My dog doesnt seem too interested in...no fault of the item.... but my daughters pug loves it! Made of thicker plastic not cheap plastic Id say. Easy to fill. Stays closed tho you have to make sure its done correctly.",5
The water actually dripped outside of the fountain. I had to return it :(,1
Perfect size for puppy training.  She loves these.  Can always depend upon Blue Buffalo products.,5
"my dogs have excellent coats, great teeth, great breath, limited shedding, and they like this food.",5
Great squeaker,5
Works great pulls undercoat out.,5
My dog loved it and the toy lasted a long time.,5
Good,5
LOVE THIS! I bought it for taking my kitten to the vet. Easy to use.,5
"Definitely works!  Saw more accidents than we wanted to see, but not able to take care of them.",5
"a little difficult to open at first. If you sue the actual sensor on their collar it does take a second or two to unlock the door....dogs make take some time to get used to it. Our dog decided the cat door was easier. A human can easily fit through this, so if you're not in a safe neighborhood, make sure this isn't in plain sight.",4
Still in once piece since Christmas.,4
"Two of my cats, brothers, love this bed, and wedge themselves side by side into it.",5
Just received this product. My dogs always needed a good white teeth like us. I started using this one and loving it absolutely brilliant idea. Thanks a lot,5
"Our cat loves catnip treats. Esp. Greenies. Hard to find catnip flavor where we usually shop.
So glad to find these and save a little money in the process.",5
"This harness fits well and is comfortable for my 15 lb dog. she is able to move freely while wearing it. It is very easy to put on because you can put your hands through the leg holes and simply grab your dogs feet and simultaneously slide the harness up and in place. Then you are able to quickly fasten it because it has a velcro fastener. The last step is clip it and you're ready to go on a walk with your best friend. There are no straps to figure out. It is fast, easy and safe for your pup.  Plus, he or she will be the most stylish pup of all the neighborhood! I like that there were so many fun colors to choose from, also. I recommend it.",5
Livebearers love it. There are times where that's all they want(especially when they had been eating meat for some time),5
My pup seems happy to have them. He's a three year old Bullmastiff and getting bigger and stronger every day.,5
"I think this is a good product.  Our cat; who is 13 years old really made a mess of our house when we took in my sister's cat when she passed away one year ago.  Whenever we think we've got the problem licked she starts up again.  Sammie had been our only cat since 2005 and she was pissed when Lucy moved in.  We're having a hard time keeping up with all of her 'accidents.'  (Sorry Sam; she's not going anywhere.)  We've used this spray with a black light and the yellow goggles that come with it.  Unbelievable the urine you'll find.  I don't recommend buying this unless you are going to go with the entire kit along side the Nature's Miracle.
Too bad we didn't look into this sooner.  You need to tackle this problem as soon as you can or you'll be looking for fresh pee areas
for hours every day.",5
The ingredients in this particular cat food are better than what I've found listed in other brands.  This was a good deal.,5
"Total waste of money.  My old pug soaks through it even with pads.  To make matters worse, you can't put it in the dryer so, in my opinion it's more trouble than it's worth.",1
applied to my cat and 30 minutes later - fleas completely dead!,5
Did not help.,3
I have used this in the past and i actually find that it DOES help! The ingredients are all natural.. and up until a few months ago i hadnt heard of this brand but friends/family had. So i tried it ..Some days i cant get home early enough from work so i give them a fighting chance at being calm with this.,5
Excellent treat for our cats!,5
Turtle is taking a long time to eat one.  But I think we are happy with it.,4
These are super!!!  No problems. My dog uses them and seems to like them.,5
"THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Keeps my dog entertained anytime we spend time outside. The only problem is, after I introduced this he has no interest in any of the other outdoor toys that I bought him. He only wants to play with this! He will wait and extend his neck towards the place that I store it. You do want to make sure you put it away as the toy part of it is something that can be choked on if your dog is not careful. The toys itself are somewhat durable but do rip over time, especially if your dog has a good grip. They should begin to sell the toys separately as replacements for torn ones. The string and handle have held up well after 2 months of use.",5
"I bought these at the Humane Society store right after adopting a rescue dog.  Hadn't had a dog since I was a kid 3 decades ago.  Things have changed a lot with the price of dog stuff.  Maybe I was a bit stunned by this fact because I rather blindly followed the recommendations of the store attendant.  I didn't realize until after the 2nd bag that it was made in China.  I worry about that fact, but I'm more concerned about the foods that use Chinese-sourced ingredients and don't disclose it.  All I can say is this has been a great treat for my dogs over the past 10 months. It probably helps their teeth as well as any other similar products and the ingredients are grainfree and haven't affected my dogs in any negative way so far.  They've love all the offered flavors except for the cinnamon one.",5
"I thought my dogs would love this, as they have similar toys that they do love. It appears durable and exactly as promised but both dogs abandoned after the initial excitement.",4
"I used this to hand feed my baby African Grey.  It works well but only for about a week, then the rubber plunger started getting stuck and would come of the injector inside the main tube.  It's pretty cheap but it should last more than a week.  I assume the rubber stopper was stretching because I actually bothered to remove it for cleaning.

If you want to use it for a bird, I suggest getting the 10mL from Petco.  Same price, smaller but better quality",3
We have an older (9 yo) aussie shep mix that has been having some issues lately.  The vet gave us some samples to use and they worked great to get him back on track.  Now we give him 1 twice a week and he seems much healthier and happier!,5
"i keep getting asked to review this crate, so ill be quick w this one.  good crate, got here quickly, nice and light and compact.",5
its alright,4
MY VET RECOMMENDS THIS FOR ALL 3 OF MY DOGS.,5
Warning:  addictive to kitties,5
Puppy LOVES these,5
Sophie's tag turned out great!  We had our names and phone numbers added to the back. We wanted to make sure to have our contact information on her because we went camping and she's deaf and tends to wander off. Nice quality tag and easy to read. Shipping took about a week to arrive in a standard envelope taped to a card.,5
"I knew there were urine spots in the carpet and pad, but they didn't show in regular lighting.  This little gadget helped me find and treat the spots and now the urine odor is gone!  (None of the urine treatment products I purchased here worked on the smell.  I found a formula on line of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and dish soap that finally did the trick...no more pee smell!)",5
This is the best toy ever. My dogs love playing fetch with it and it is big enough for both of my boxers to get their mouths on so they play tug of war with it. Highly recommend JW Pet toys. They are now my go to puppy presents!,5
These are so great for poopy diapers on the go. I have a bunch of them in every diaper bag.,5
"I ordered this without reading the reviews first. Once it was on its way i decided i should probably see what i got myself into.. let me just tell you that the bad reviews are wrong and im happy i didn't cancel my order!! its very tall and is has enough room for all four of our cats to play on it at one time. the second it came out of the box the cats were all over it!! the directions are fine, everything is labeled very clearly, and you follow the number and picture! took me by myself 25-30 min to build. i couldn't be happier!!!! yes it wobbles a little but not enough to effect anything, my cats don't mind it, even when their at the very top of it. im talking a tiny wobble. we are planning on buying another cat tree for them so they have two and honestly, i may buy the same one, i love it that much! my cats haven't gotten off it yet! playing, sleeping, their loving it. i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone!!

UPDATE!!!****** ive had this for a while now and i would just like to add that a while ago the middle small cat house had fallen over. i ended up throwing away the smaller stand with the sisal on it and just resting the smaller cat house on one of the ledges and added a cat bed to the bottom part.",5
I bought this for my hermit crabs at work and I think they definitely liked it! They buried themselves in as soon as I added this into their habitat.,5
Durable construction with very soft lining.  Color is an ice blue with lots of reflection stitches.  Highly recommend for a chubby maltese like mine or a more powerful dog.  I am getting the green next.,5
We have a 110# Black Lab mix as well as another small dog and 2 cats. This bowl holds enough water for the whole gang so that it only needs to be filled twice a day.,5
"Our small dog (pug) loves ""worrying"" and biting this toy - at least until the squeakers give out.  And unfortunately they went ""dead"" after just two days of use.  The fabric seems tough enough, but the two squeakers inside are obviously cheap and not durable at all.  This is the second time we've had the same experience with a Skinneeez toy.  Good idea, not very well executed thanks to lousy component parts.  I probably would have given this toy four stars otherwise (as mentioned, our dog truly loves these things when the squeaker is part of the fun).  This product does not cost much, but a mere one or two days of squeaking is pretty disappointing and ridiculous.",2
Gave away to German Sheperd.  Was too big for chihuahua.  Quality product but did not work for my need at all,2
"This is the best toothbrush I have used for my dog. I recommend it to people all the time. Brushing goes by soooo much faster. Before I was using a finger brush and this one is definitely easier to use.

I added some photos with my dog so you can see the size. She's a five pound yorkie and we got the small breed toothbrush. I wish it was even smaller though. I've noticed some other reviews saying it is too big as well. It's still the best one I've found for my dog though.",5
"Our parakeets love these rings. They are constantly playing on them... climbing, going through the rings, trying to grab the bell with their beaks. For the price of these toys (which is quite cheap), it is easy to have a bunch of different ones on hand so they can be swapped out every week or two to ensure they keep interest. The rings are not flimsy and actually pretty thick. The small plastic holder/hanger that is at the top to hang it from the cage (and on the bell) appears flimsy at first (and one user said it was weak for their cockatiel), but even with a little chewing by the birds, shows no signs of wear. Perhaps my two parakeets are not as heavy as a cockatiel. Either way, I think these are probably going to last a long time.",5
very good quality,5
"Timmy, my fish,  loves this.",5
"I have been very pleased with the support this product is providing for my 12 year old cat.  My vet had recommended that she be put on this when her liver enzymes were elevated. The blood tests showed that the liver enzymes have returned to normal and vet has prescribed this as a long term medication.  The best prices for this product I found, was on this site.  Always check with your vet but I really like this product.",5
The only problem i have with them they are not soft. It is hard to get some pills in them,5
"Kitties love it and great construction! If they approve, I approve.",5
"My cat didn't care for catnip AT ALL, until a friend bought her a box of Cosmic Catnip.  It's really changed her behavior for the better.  This box is a great buy.",5
"my dog loves it, but she has a sensitive tummy and can't eat it anymore",5
My cats LOVE the heck outta this,5
"Great Quality pouch with multiple attachment options, easy to clean, easy to use and at a great price!",5
To hard to hold down the button the whole time you brush. I was really excited but highly disappointed.,1
"The first door I received was junk! My dogs stood at the door waiting and scratching/pawing to get in. The door would only open 2 out of 5 times. I didn't like the idea of paying $140 an automatic doggy door that was nothing more than a normal dog door. So I was crossing my fingers that I received a junky one and requested a replacement. So happy I did! The 2nd door is MUCH better. Its a little glitchy though, now instead of not opening for the dogs it now opens further away. The range is to be said 3ft, but its around 6ft. Which wouldnt be bad if my bed wasn't 6 feet from the door. So the door unlocks when my dog switches positions. (One sleeps with me) I have 3 indoor cats and I'm nervous that they will escape thought out the night. I've turned down the sensitivity, but cannot seem it find a happy medium. I'm still working on finding it though! I have high hopes for this door!

I have the doggy door installed in the door in my room. Door goes from outside dog yard to my room. IDK how else to explain it. Anyways, I had purchased this door because my dogs kept having accidents during the night. They eat when they can and they like eating at night I guess. We have to close and normal doggy door bc the cats sneak out.

I hope I've explained myself well enough.",4
"We purchased the dog door about 9 years ago.  This year the original flap required replacement.  Apparently in the years since we installed the original door, the design has been changed.  Our metal framed door needs some adjustments in order to use this replacement flap.  The flap is also just a wee bit narrower than the original one.  That will now allow wind to blow around the edges. but with the great big hole in the wall, not a whole lot I can do about it.  Not very happy about it.

So it has been a while since we replaced the old flap with the new one from PetSafe.  As I said earlier, the new flap is narrower, of thinner material and I am still not happy.  I have not contacted PetSafe because they have no other flap for the extra large door.  I have an idea of how to ""fix"" the problem, it just will require a trip to a hardware store for some tough, flexible plastic and a really good, waterproof glue.  Once I have worked the flap over, I will post another update on my success or failure.  I was correct about the wind blowing around the edges and the bottom magnet does not seal very well.  I think it might be a lighter weight also.  Once my big, old dogs are gone, I will have the hole in my wall repaired and will never buy another PetSafe product.",2
My kitten immediately demolished this!  waste of 2.50!,2
It's not as powerful as I had hoped but it does an adequate job. It was quiet for about a week and then it sometimes a bit loud. I don't know why. It has rubber feet and I tried cushioning it but to no avail. Not a serious issue but an issue none-the-less.,3
"My dogs are extreme chewers and love this! We put treats inside, bits of killed stuffed animals or even torn up t-shirts.",5
Jack th dog luvs it,5
Nice,5
All four cats from 6yrs to 1 yr old won't even go near it. Not sure why but they just look at it and walk away.,1
"Not impressed.
My tank is cycling & I've used up my Hach ammonia kit, so decided to try this one.
Briefly--the discs float on top of the sample surface and the color change is inconsistent across the disc.

Got the package and read the instructions; the procedure as described is very simple:
You put a sample in the little well (they hold about 1ml), pick up a disc with the forceps, rinse it with clean water, and put it in the well.
After 15 minutes you read disc color against scale (marked 0-6ppm) or after 30 minutes (same scale marked 0-3ppm).

So...open the jar of discs & notice there are some crystals on top of them.  Maybe the storage solution has dried out?  Pushed down on the sponge at the bottom of the storage jar--seems to be saturated; maybe this is how it's supposed to be.

I made 2 samples, one full strength and one diluted 50/50 with RO water and put the discs in according to the instructions.
After 15 minutes the color across both discs was very patchy; difficult to read.
Waited 30 minutes for the full change; hoping the color will be consistent.
Guessing that the top side didn't get enough exposure to the sample, I looked at both sides--nope both are patchy; can't really tell what the color is.

Next I tried to hold the discs down with a piece of plastic cut from a vinyl hose--maybe if I leave it in an hour it will give a readable result?
Guessing the color will eventually equilibrate?  After another 30 minutes there is no improvement.
Maybe take a photo each time & calculate the mean color with the GIMP?
Or mentally ignore the still-yellow parts of the disc & try to imagine what the rest of the color is?
Seriously?

Sorry--I can't use this; wasted my fifteen bucks.  Going back to the Hach test.  It costs a little more for the refills, but at least it's readable.",1
"For some reason, our golden-doodle prefers this over the traditional nylabone.  Maybe it's the flavor or shape; he's had it a few months so ""newness novelty"" would have worn off by now.

It would be better if it didn't get all rough (see picture) and flake off little burrs of plastic that stick in socks and bare feet, but since big blocks of silicone don't satisfy chew cravings, and most other things are shredded in minutes, this is the best compromise I've found.

Update:  after 6 months, he has really put a dent in it (second picture), but it continues to be a favorite.",5
"Works great, cat loves it. So do I. A real answer to the shedding problem and helps keep kitty from getting hairballs. I have a chihuahua and I use it on her also.",5
The last batch that I got was really fresh and my African Senegal really like it.,5
"Purchased this for my Son's dog when she is with me, got him a black one and my Daughter a blue one.",5
"Great harness. I really like this design. I was able to adjust it to fit my dog without it being too tight and rubbing behind her legs like is common with other harnesses. When we go to the dog park it stays on her and she's able to run full steam with no issues. My dog pulls less with this harness when compared to a collar, even in the normal top attachment point. The lower chest mount point reduces pulling even further but I haven't really needed to use it. The materials and construction are top notch and I definitely think it's worth the price.",5
"Cats like to sleep inside, while my feet are propped on top of the cube.  Looks very nice, like a small side table.",5
Started using when our dog was 1 1/2 years old and have been using ever since - she has beautiful white teeth!,5
I bought 2 of these.  My cat LOVES them.  May have to get some more.  I saw a picture online where someone had mounted a bunch of them on the wall.  Hmmm.....,5
"It was a bit small, but not bad. The last one was way too big.",3
"The food comes out of this toy easily. I thought it would keep my cat entertained for hours, but she got all of the food out of it in a matter of minutes.",3
Does not deter my Beagle from eating hers or my sister's dogs poop.,1
"My mini Holland Lop loves his hideout. He sleeps there, and he chews on it when he's bored.",5
I bought this with a couple other pieces for a 65 gallon aquarium. It looks great and I love the fact the holes are large enough to view the fish inside the tree. Great addition to my tsnk.,5
"The letter is not scored deep enough and is wearing it is hard to see the letters, I will need to buy some new tags soon. the shine has warnoff. I like the fact that you can get 4 line on one side. I would be a great item if the shine and letter did not wear down.",2
"My cat, Carol, LOVES this. She's so happy. Set up was fun! It didn't take very long and instructions were clear (clearer than say, IKEA) definitely a bit wobbly but all the more fun to take bets on when your cat is going to hit the floor. 5/5",5
"I bought this to use on weekends when I'm not home... Fairly easy to use if you read the instructions. My biggest issue is that it doesn't have an off button so I thought it would automatically shut off when the settings were finished.. It doesn't. So unless you're taking the batteries out when not in use or if you're using this every single day, it's a waste. My fault for not checking first. I also wish it would beep or something when the batteries are running low. Instead there's just a faint red light.",2
Best way to go for reptiles. Don't even bother with those stupid strips or dial style thermometers. They don't work. This is what you need! Get all your surface temps all over the enclosures.,5
Very sturdy and simple to put together. We had it for year in the house and then another year outside and it still strong and no rotting. Outside and may have leaks -- water can get inside of it but we have it inside the shed like building so the rabbits are nice and dry,5
dog loves it,5
Ok,5
"This is a wonderful quality food, and is affordable given its quality.  Our dog loves it, and the kibble size is nice for a small dog.",5
Very light and comfy. My cats love it. Easily washable. Considering getting another for another room.,5
"I love this trainer. I have some stubborn dogs who don't know their names when they don't want to listen. One push of the button, and suddenly they are no longer deaf to my voice. Simple solution.",5
Under the tree for my little girls Christmas Present. I'm sure she'll love it!,5
These work so awesome,5
This has been abused a lot in the past 5 days. One ear was torn off immediately. My cat loves it though!,4
"My dog is constantly doing something that results in her needing to wear a cone, and unfortunately hard cones don't suit her personality well. So when I found this, it was great. She's able to sleep in it and it doesn't freak her out. If your dog is a Houdini, they might get around this, because it's not super high. However I think my Houdini knows what the alternative is and hasn't tried to thwart the comfy cone once.",5
Works as expected,5
"First, I'm only giving this 2 stars because the designation for one single star is ""I hate it"" and I reserve such sentiment for much more important matters.  But, as for this toy, I had high hopes since it is made out of a nice, thick rubber.  However, within 15 minutes of receiving this toy, our Lab had a large chunk torn out of the end and it was thrown into the trash.  I do not recommend this toy for any dogs that are heavy chewers.",2
My dogs is healthy and doesn't have spotting issues because of her diet now,5
Teacher asked for a donation for an animal shelter. this was a great price and got here fast.,5
"I bought the Davis Benzoyl Peroxide, the Miconzole and the Chlorhexidine shampoos.  Our old female shepherd kept having horrible staph skin infections which almost killed her.  The vet bills were racking up fast and we were about to put her down...
Now I give her a bath (shower) every couple of weeks and I wash her with each shampoo for about 5 minutes each....
She no longer had any open sores, no hot spots and she does not bite at her skin.  Plus she does not shed nearly as much.
This series of shampoos saved our dog and I use them on our Ridgeback as well just so he does not pick up the same problem.
I would pay lots more for this brand now that I know how well it works.",5
"I only bought this pair because one of our four dogs lost its muttluk in the snow last winter.  It has since been found.  We are putting the boots away to use for a third winter at the end of this year.  They last.  They wash (hand wash).  They protect!  And they cost a mint!  So far, it seems you get what you pay for.",4
"Running 3 of these bulbs on an indoor tortoise enclosoure. Been a couple months and they still work well. Potency of UVB output has deminished a good bit after the 1st 30 days, but im still getting about 40% on the meter.",4
No bad breath and my dog seems to be super healthy.,5
Our hammy loves these. Always have one in his cage.,5
I had read article that this was not good for birds (ingredients) so I don't think I will purchase again,2
Cool you can put small treats in the head hours of fun for the dog!,5
"First off it does what it says, but the title is a little misleading especially for a saltwater novice like myself. It is my fault for not reading the enire description or reviewing the reviews thus the 3 stars. As many stated before this is basically a day/night, on/off switch. When the day (yellow) outlets are on going off whatever you programmed the night (blue) are off and they turn on whenever you have your days to turn off. There is no time programming control or programming for the nights as you can see from what was sted earlier.",3
good,4
"I don't know how effective this product is but the first time we applied it on our 10 lb Shorkie (last month), we noticed he had a twitch in both hindquarters. This month, he was listless for at least 24 hours and didn't eat. The twitch also came back after the second application for a couple of days. I am concerned about the reaction he had to this medication so I'm not giving it to him again. I'll try to find something else he can tolerate. Other dogs may tolerate it just fine, but ours doesn't. K9 Advantix may do a good job fending off fleas and ticks but it's not right for our dog.",2
"You can't go wrong with any Andis Blade or Clipper , they just keep on doing the job they were designed to do. If you go to Andis. Com they have a great blade chart , that can be printed out, and it will help you make the choice of what size and style Andis blade to purchase.",5
The shape and size are excellent. Seems clean and fresh.  My Lab loves it  I did use my bench grinder to smooth a sharp corner that was sawed - no big deal.,5
"Great product, I use it all the time.",5
"My ferret loves this, she couldn't stop playing with it. Make sure you buy the Marshall ball pit with it!!!!",5
"Works pretty well for dogs that are the same size. Still has some drawbacks but overall works well, some pulling and tangling.",3
"We've used these bags in a bucket with a toilet seat during camping trips, and loved the way they work.  The gel solidifies liquids, and help keep the odor down too.  They seal up nicely in the included disposal bag, without any worries about leaking before you get to a dumpster or approved disposal station.  We change them out every day so they don't get too full and overwhelm the gel.

Recently our power went out in a storm, and we used these bags inside the house toilet bowl to avoid using our water storage to flush the toilet manually.  Again, these bags did a great job.  If we had to use this method for more than a day or two, we would probably use sawdust or cat litter in the bags (a scoop every time we use the toilet) to help neutralize odors and absorb liquids.

I just ordered more of these bags - they are worth the money!",5
"Bought this on the strength of Embark's association with Cornell University and dog research. What others have said is true. The Embark team gives regular updates and offers to clarify and explain. My dog's results were a surprise in the sense that the recessive genes seem to have come to the fore with him. I really appreciate the testing for 160 genetically related diseases as well as the extent of in-breeding.

My dog looks very much like a rare breed that Embark's tests do not include, so I may have to get the competition's product, which tests for that breed, as well.",4
"I have a small 12 gallon saltwater tank with 2 fish, a starfish & a sea urchin which I'm told is to many fish for a tank that size! And they are right my nitrates were in the High 40 range in the red color on the test kit. I tired doing water changes like ever 4 days and I could Not get it under 40.

After researching what I can do to get nitrates down I bought a canister filter and de*nitrate and 3 weeks later my nitrates are now in the 20 range (orange color on the test kit)it has to be the de*nitrates because water changes wasn't doing it and I hadn't change anything else except add canister filter & de*nitrates. I hope with more time my nits will go down even more becasue it says take 4 to 6 weeks before you see a change, well I saw it in 3 weeks, I'm hoping in 6 weeks to have zero nitrates. Best part it says never change it!! So it's cheap! And now I only do a water change ever 3 weeks, since my nits are staying in low orange 20 range.",5

"It's cute and serves it's purpose.  It is cheap plastic, but for the price not bad.",3
"We've used this more times than I can count with a large German Shepherd. If you fasten the Velcro in the front carefully (as much surface area as possible, it stays on forever (the belly fastener is a clip). The side pockets are useful for more than just poo bags: I've used them to pack his collapsible water bowl, emergency blankets, whistle, pocket knife, water filterer, and other lightweight stuff. The pockets aren't for water bottles. I have a red vest... always good for keeping your dog from looking anything like a deer, especially during hunting season.

The other thing we use this for is nighttime walks. The reflective tape is really really visible: cars slow down well ahead of reaching us. It makes the walk safer for the dog and the person.",5
"My dog loves it.

My dog is a rat terrier with a super sensitive skin, caused by seasonal allergy and food allergy. She had less reaction when I fed her this. However, it is quite pricey.",5
"My dog was having a hard time going up the stairs, and would often just lay at the bottom looking up the stairs. He started taking these, and the stairs were no longer an obstacle. I let me friend know about these. and he swears by these too. My dog has been taking these for nearly 2 years now, and this has helped with his quality of life. Thank you for the added years Nutri-Vet!!",5
"Price is always right, can get the quantities I want and delivered to the door quickly.",5
My dog loves these.,5
Great Product! Fast delivery! Works as advertised!,5
"Good deal, especially with free shipping",5
I purchased this off of vet recommendation because I needed something for my cats after we moved. Im not entirely sure if this was what worked but my cats did calm down a lot and my older one wasn't as stressed out it seems. Im gonna purchase a refill and update my review,4
"I have two big cats that like this product because they fit comfortably in these litter boxes, unlike other boxes.",5

"Be careful with this one, it runs a little small. So far my pug has worn medium in several styles of Puppia. But this one runs a bit small. The buckles are not adjustable, however the velcro is.  Its was a miss for us, will exchange though for the largee its adorable and well made. Just love these harnesses.",5
"These are perfect crate pads, especially for the price. Will buy more of these in various sizes.",5
My cat took to this right away.  I like the idea of being able to fill it every so often rather than every day.,5
"Just a hard, hollow plastic ball.",1
Perfect on time delivery and good quality heater.,5
"Im so happy I ordered the 2-Pack Bundle Pet Grooming Massage Glove and Brush Glove. Im not the only one whos happy, both of my two kitties are really happy too!  This set comes with two gloves. The red glove has short nubby rubber tips and is like giving a massage to your kitty with the added benefit of brushing and removing shedding fur. The gray glove has stainless steel pins with a yellow rubber tip that is meant more for more longer haired pets that need serious grooming and deshedding. my kitties much more prefer the red glove. They come running when I take the glove out and put it on and they fight for who gets to be petted/rubbed down first with the red glove. As soon as the red glove comes in contact with their fur, the deep  purring begins and you can definitely tell they are in kitty heaven.  The gray glove with the spiky pins is a little bit too intense for my young kittens, perhaps they might like it more when they get bigger and older. Both gloves are well made with well sewn seams that I feel will last a long time and not unravel. Both gloves do a great job in picking up a lot of fur but the one caveat is that the accumulated fur is difficult to remove from the brush. I really have to really work hard at it to remove all the hair from the brush. On the plus side, both brushes are machine washable but I wouldnt want to toss it into my washing machine when its all clumped up with fur",5
"I previously reviewed this product and gave it an enthusiastic 5 stars.  Unfortunately their quality has gone down hill.  I reordered the same product I've ordered in the past and paid the same price but the lamb ears I got this time are all 2-2.5 inches smaller than my previous batch.  See photo below--the one in the center is my previous order.  These ears should be categorized as small sized and should cost 25-30% less than what I have been paying in the past.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!

My previous 5 star review:  I have purchased other lamb ear brands and I think this is the best value and best quality available.  All the the lamb ears are large and fairly clean looking.  Other companies sell bulk lamb ears that have several that are 50-60% smaller than the HDP ears.  This is my ""go to"" source whenever I get Lamb ears.  Their product is consistently high quality.",2
Good product with healthy ingredients for my dog. He has bad tummy problems and these were recommended by vet. He loves them.,4

"If it wasn't for this frisbee my dog never would have learned. The tips they give you on their website are golden! The soft style of this frisbee makes it easier for your dog to catch, it fly's straight and long too! Bonus it floats.

So Far a Great Item. Fits as Said. A bit Costly?? But where do you find one Cheaper. No Where..,5
"Very easy to fold up. I chose the large sized crate for my kitten so he can have his food and litter box in his ""house."" I don't like to sleep with pets, so this was the perfect option. Very easy to travel with and extremely well priced - you won't find a better deal.",5
our cat had a spleenectomy  in Dec 2014 for a hemangiosarcoma.  Our vet suggested we supplement her with I'm-Yunity daily along with a chemo pill every three days.  They told us without any treatment she might live 2 weeks to 2 months.  We are at 4 1/2 months and she is doing well.  Her appetite is good and her coat is so soft.  We definitely feel that this supplement is wonderful.,5
When this brush arrived the bristles were all tweaked .,2

"I have a one year old tabby cat who sheds like a beast in the spring. You can't even pet her without getting a handful of furs flying out. I bought her a shedder brush and she hated it. She wouldn't let the thing near her. I tried using a regular cat brush, same result. I bought this as a last ditch effort. I am so glad I did. My cat LOVES this thing. She comes right over and jumps up on your lap as soon as she sees it in your hand. She sits like a lady and lets you brush her. She even rolls over so you can get her belly!  This thing sucks up fur like crazy! As you are brushing the cut the loose fur gets stuck to the material the brush is made of so you don't have it flying everywhere. It's easy to clean, easy to use, my cat loves it. I bought one for a few of my friends who have cats because I was so pleased with how well this product works. My cat has nice shiny fur and is shedding much less now that we have regular brushing sessions. I can not recommend this item highly enough. This brush is a nice shape for your hand and is very easy to hold. It is made of a bendable plastic so it has some give if your cat decides she wants to take control and just rub against it.  I love this brush and plan to buy a second back up just in case we lose or somehow break this one.",5
"Awesome cat litter, have been using for a couple years. A couple times I got pretty dusty bags but all the other times there was almost no dust. Much much less than other cat litter I have tried.",5
"I have several tanks and grass rings. Out of the double-digit species of fish, I only have seen the betta use it.",3
"We purchased this for our 5 month old Dachshund. I work full-time and I think keeping a puppy in a kennel is awful. I like the way you can make this pen smaller or larger and the shape. Love the little door. Cute! We did purchase a piece of linoleum to put under this.  She went through separation anxiety for awhile and pooped in her pen. But she is doing so much better now. Puppies do like to have a small crate or kennel to go in. I would suggest putting this in the pen with your dog or puppy. And I also purchased the puppy pad holder. If you do not your puppy with play with the puppy pad.

 I feel so much better leaving my pup at home now. I know she is safe and she has room to move around and play with her toys.
This is a great buy!!!",5
Cats gobble these daily,5
"I can't even believe how well the tarter remover/scraper worked.  As long as your dog can tolerate you fiddling around in their mouth, this can seriously save you the $400 doggie dental.  This tool is fantastic!  I love it!",5
Dog loves it.,5
GREAT DISH BUT NOTE THAT IT DOESN'T SHIP FOR 1 TO 2 MONTHS.,5
Been using these for several years for my dog who had a broken shoulder several years ago.  Seems to be pretty effective at keeping her in good shape as far as her joints are concerned.,5
"Reef Energy A & B have made a difference with our corals. We soak mysis shrimp and cyclop-eeze in Reef Energy A & B, some phyto, and oysterfeast. Everything loves it! The corals are doings great and the fish love the feading frenzy. We also soak mysis in Reef Energy A & B and feed that to our seahorses. I think it has made their color pop a little more too and the algaes we have in the seahorse tank appreciate the extra nutrients. This 2 pack it what we purchased the first time but the bottles are smaller than what you can get if your purchase them separately. We buy the bigger bottles now since we use this on a regular basis.",5
These are a very good value. The bag you get looks so much larger than what is in the picture. The lamb lung pieces are huge and much better quality than you see in pet stores these days. My Pekingese loves them. He can only have certain treats with his allergies.,5
"I thought this would be a lifetime supply, but it turns out my dog poops more than I thought.  These bags function as advertised and I haven't had any faulty ones with holes in them.",5
All three of my cats love this bed. The size is perfect and a very nice color. It's definitely worth the price. Great product!,5
Sturdy and well made.,5
"This orange bowl is beautiful and perfect. Doesnt skid, washes easily by hand, perfect small size for meals, excellent price, so very pretty.
Cats love different bright colors.
Huge shame that identical bowls in different colors cost more than four times as much. Guess the cats won't get matching bowls. Sorry, much as we love this orange bowl, cutting two stars as the exact same bowls in different colors are too ridiculously expensive.",3
Great covers. Wish they covered sides of seat but worth the purchase,5
"sooooper flimsy. not expensive enough to worry about, but yuck.",2
"Well, we mixed these into her food. She ate all her food and left these. :(  Back to the drawing board.",1
"If your dogs need glucosamine and chondroitin, this is the product for you. It must be tasty because my 14 1/2 year old Westie loves it as does her much younger sister.",5
"My dogs loved this flavor! They gladly allowed this in their mouth, and would start licking as soon as I bring it out.",5
"My dogs both love these bones. When all the filling is gone I restuff them with all kinds of things...canned dog food, chicken, veggies, etc. Then stick them in the freezer for a few hours and they love them all over again!!",5
"I have been subscribing to these pads on Amazon for quite a while now since we set up the Tidy Cats Breeze systems for our two cats.  They come in a box with 10 packs with 4 pads in each pack.  Pretty handy deal and I never have to remember to buy them at the pet store.

These things work great and can hold quite a bit of liquid if you forget to change the box in a timely manner.  You do have to be careful when sliding them into the tray that they don't get bunched or folded up.  That happened a couple of times and is a memorable stinky mess when you end up with a tray full of urine that hasn't been absorbed.

The odor control on these has been a life-changer for us.  We were never the best at litter box maintenance and didn't always get to it every day.  Even if we were pretty rigorous, you ended up with yucky smelling litter pretty quickly due to the bits of urine clumps left that you didn't get scooped out.  These pads eliminate that problem with the Breeze system.  The pee goes through the grates and onto the pad and never gets all nasty with old litter.

The biggest downside with this system is if you have a cat who pees ""high"" sometimes.  There is no hood for the box, so if you have a high peeing cat, it might end up over the edge and onto your floor.  We solved the problem by putting the Breeze boxes in a Walmart plastic bin then cutting an access hole to allow the cats in.  Worked wonders and is probably easier to clean than if the Breeze system had a built in hood.

We are totally sold with the Breeze system, our cats fully adapted and it has been better for us than any of the machines, etc.",5
Simple and sturdy dish holder. I use these for my 50-60 pound pit bull mixes and they are the perfect height.,5
"It stays on the back seat with 3 dogs jumping in and out every day. It does get dirty. That means that the seat would be very filthy, if the mat was not on it. It is easy to install and take off.",5
2 min work for Shepherd mix :),4
"This is great vest, perfect fit, and looks beautiful on my dog. Thank you.",5
"I'm not big on reviewing products,  but this one deserved praise. I had my doubts when ordering this, it has literally changed my life. I recommend watching the dvd, and taking steps to get your pup adjusted.  Once it's on the difference is remarkable. I went from blistered hands at the end of a walk to a dog who doesn't leave my side. This collar is absolutely amazing.",5
"This canister is adorable and the lid fits nice and snug, it's just a lot smaller then I was hoping for. I should have read the measurements first.",4
I have been using this product for years for my Australian Shepard after she had an leg/hip injury. I take one pill and split it in half and give her a half with her morning and evening meal. She has not had a leg/hip problem since she started using this.,4
My dogs love this food and it has made a tremendous difference in their skin and coat. All my dogs are rescues and have had skin and Allergy issues in the past. I switch up my flavors every few months or so but always stay with Taste of the Wild. They love the Boar and the Bison as well as this flavor. You can't go wrong with this brand and your dogs will thank you!,5
So cute and fits my little yorkie fine.  She was 3 lbs (adjusted to the smallest then) when I got her and is 6lbs now adjusted to half way let out now. .  It adjusts great. Color and design adorable on her.,5
"It would have been most helpful had the description stated it was 220v. I now have a useless heat emitter. This is being shipped from China, so returning it is not an option. What a waste of my money.",1
"great quality, but too big for the size. back clasp promotes pulling.",4
I'm very happy with this leash.  Had one before but it got lost.  I can walk my two dogs alone with the leash.  The dog are 45 and 60 lbs.  The 45lb one also has a head collar on to prevent him from pulling.  Did a 30 minute walk last pm and it worked well.  I think the well behaved dog helps keep the wild one in line.,5
Love these bags,5
"This fits perfectly in my car and is extremely durable! I love the pockets for storing my guys stuff. It adjusts at all 4 corners so I know you can use it for a smaller or larger car. It has a velcro hole so the seatbelt can be pulled through.  It has protected my car without any issues. It also washes very good, just hang it dry don't out in the dryer. Definitely worth buying and have told others about it. Very happy!!!",5
"Big bowls, great price! Stylish bowl set, for large dogs (I have a GSD)",5
The best thing i have bought for my cat. When hes mad he just goes and kick his kickeroo. Good option for him to stop biting me.,5
Was purchased for a Great Dane and she loves it!!!,5
"My cat ""Scout"" seems to like this, but then he is fussy, but he eats it twice a day..I rate it pretty good, as he is fussy.",4
"Upon arrival, the box was missing 2 rolls of waste bags. I contacted the seller and they sent me the missing rolls including extra. These bags work well and they are big enough for a big dogs waste. My hands never smell bad and I like the fact that they are earth friendly.",5
Less mess and more absorbent than other products. I use it as litterbox filler for our pet rabbit. Bunny approves; by not tossing the stuff everywhere as she does with wood shavings.,5
Don't bother with this one! My 15 lb peekapoo chewed through this in 15 mins.,1
"This feeder seems to do the job of  feeding a lot of birds longer.  The birds seem to like hanging on while feeding.  Soooo, it's good.",4
"It looks good in the picture. That is about as good as it gets. It is a super soft ""fall apart"" bed. The walls of the bed flop around, and have no shape. The soft lining ""pills"" from the start. My dog got a piece of the material in her mouth and almost choked. Very dissatisfied with this purchase.
Would not recommend it to anyone.  MAK, PA",1
"I've got a beagle and she's got a destructive streak, but respects this. I think it's because beagles love food, but she has a blast eating her meals now!",5
"I got this to re-sisal the cat'e scratching post/tree. I cut about two inches off the large size to make it fit and wrapped it around, then stapled it on with a staple gun. As you can see in the pictures, kitty loves it! Sturdy and easy fix :)",5
"Nice finish, no blemishes or burrs
Perfect size for our shorthair cat",5
the tape or cord of the leash slides in and out without any tangling--it is very comfortable in my hand which is good since I have arthritis in my hands.  It is easy for me to clip to her collar and seems very heavy duty.,5
Very happy,5
"The blue came as a baby blue color and not a navy blue as shown in the advertisement, I bought the red and grey ones at the same time and they are true to color. But they're still great feeding mats and easy to clean",3
Product works. My bulldog likes the taste too.,5
"I feel like I've purchased a small pet boutique's worth of treat/kibble dispensing toys for my dogs to play with to give them some stimulation. (If you read all my reviews, you'll see a bunch of them, but I have a bunch more.)  This toy is by far the easiest one to get the treats out of unless you invest in some seriously large treats. Even my dog that usually struggles to figure out how to dispense the treats can empty this ball quickly.  In truth, that's usually why I put it in circulation. Sometimes I feel bad that he can't figure out the other toys. Although this ball seems relatively sturdy, a tough chewer could probably still chew it open if s/he wanted to. I don't think that would happen just to get the treats out though, as they'll dispense easily enough on their own. If you're looking for a more challenging toy of this genre, I'd go with the blue Everlasting Treat Toy over this green Everlasting Fun Ball.  Due to the flat sides of the blue treat toy, it usually ends up stuck under my couch less frequently than this ball, too, which tends to roll into numerous complicated spots for the dogs to retrieve on their own. If you're looking for a ball to dispense dry kibble, this one won't work, as the holes are far too large. For that purpose, I'd suggest the larger, orange Tricky Treat Ball by another manufacturer. In short, this is a fun, but easy toy for dispensing treats. To make it stay fuller longer and amuse your dog for a greater period of time, you'll need to stuff it with larger treats than average, even larger than the ones StarMark sells for this ball, in my opinion.",3
If you have a dog that loves to play and love there treats.  This works for you my dog I put his food in there and he chases it all over the yard and he has fun.,5
scoops the poop.,5
"I would purchase another one if I had to.  Actually my wife found this one.
It pops open from being folded.  All you have to do is zip the top and bottom on.
It was large enough for our new kitten to live in for several months (night only) and she really liked it too.
It has several doors and screens and a pocket or 2 (can't remember).
The doors roll up and have hook and loop to keep it opened.
Folds up and stores in its own bag too.
We only use it occasionally now.
The floor is solid and the top is mesh.
The top zipper even overlaps so the kitty (or doggy) doesn't get any ideas and try to unzip it from the inside, a nice touch.
Nicely made.",5
"This bed is pretty nice actually. For the price it filled the need and I actually like that it is flat so it will sit in the crate and not be a tempting thing to chew on. Having a double sided feature is nice too, during the day my dog lies on the cotton side-the cool side and at night when the AC and fan are on we flip it over to the wooly side so he has some extra warmth. I haven't washed it yet but can see the sewn design probably does keep the fluff from spreading around to one side like advertised. If I were to design this myself I would just make it more padded, but then again, the more padded beds were also more expensive.",4
"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 is I actually ordered the wrong one - twice!  First I ordered the wrong size, sent that back, re-ordered the wrong product!  I wanted the no-pull harness and ended up with the regular one.  It actually works fine so am keeping it but will probably re-order the other at some point.",4
My dogs love these!  Definitely a favorite toy in our house!  They are durable but I do have a  crazy chewer and if I do not keep an eye on him he will get them open.,5
Our Chihuahua Bella loves her hedge hog she loves getting mail.....thanks for a great product at a great price.. Great service...,5
"My mother's cat absolutely loves this. Installation is easy, but when installing, make sure you leave enough room between the window and the base for the cover to go over and tuck in. I installed hers a little too close and had to open the window to get the cover on, but it still does the trick. My only complaint is there is no on/off switch. The only way to turn it off is to unplug it, which can be difficult if your outlet is hard to reach. However, you may never need to unplug it because your cat is going to be on it all the time.",5
This is the correct bag of flying southwest with an animal between 16-20 lbs,5
great item,5
"My 4 month old dachshund/beagle mix is a pretty strong chewer so I thought these would be perfect for her, however she prefers the nylabones that have a little bit of flex in them. She does dig these out of her basket every so often to chew on though. The product holds up as it should. You can see teeth marks in the bones, but she hasn't been able to destroy them. I recommend this product if your pup likes to chew on something a little harder. I'm not going to down grade it just because my pup doesn't care for them too much.",5
"Well the birds love it. I generally burry these under pelleted food and flax seed so that it is a treat that they must search for. I have noticed that they are picking it out before all the other food which means they like it, I do feel that it is healthier than other options out there especially if you have pellet picky eaters ( which I do). I would recommend supplementing veggies and other items in to diversify their diets and don't over feed on seeds as this product has enough in there already.",5
"Since we got our beloved Golden Retrievers, over thirteen years ago, I made a vow that I would be ultra diligent with their dental care because I wanted to keep them as healthy as possible, keep their breath fresh, & for them to never feel dental pain/discomfort. Starting from only a few weeks of age, they have had their teeth brushed nearly every day of their precious lives. In the beginning, I experimented with few different brands of toothpastes, but ultimately found a winning combination. I have been using this product for 5+ years now.

Individually, I have them lie down with their left side up against the kitchen or bathroom cupboards. I put & a pea-sized amount of this product on their toothbrush, along with a squirt of PetzLife mint gel. I rest their head on my knee to stabilize their face, & begin by lifting the jowls on the left side & brushing in both directions, back & forth. To get the bottom back molars is a little tricky, but I angle to the toothbrush & slide it into place when their mouths open. Then I brush the right side of their teeth, applying another squirt of both toothpastes to the brush. I am careful to ensure that all of the teeth have been thoroughly scrubbed.

The combination of these two products has worked really well for my girls. The PetzLife mint flavor keeps their breath minty fresh, although they don't really like the taste of it; the C.E.T product helps to prevent tartar accumulation & they like the flavor. This color of this product is clear, with a gel-like consistency. The reason, however, why I rated the product a 4 instead of a 5 is because the tube sometimes gets cracks in it, causing the gel to squirt out in the wrong place. I think a plastic based tube would be significantly easier to use & more practical (like what human toothpaste is put in).

After I finish brushing their teeth, I wipe their faces with a soft cloth & inspect the skin around their mouths. Lastly, I give the inside of their ears a good look over & then they're done! Happy, beautiful girls!",4
Great crate - but not so much for a puppy that chews. Probably best for an older smaller dog. Also - if the dog has accidents in it - it is not easy to clean up inside. Lots of tubes and seams.,5
My cockatoo seems content with this food.,5
"The chew toy is  a disk that fits into the base. My 8 month old puppy figured out that she can pop out the chew toy and finish it in less than 15 minutes. Then she chewed up the base for good measure. Total waste of money for my pup. I guess it might work for little dainty doggies but if you have a pit bull  like i do, save your money. This is not for you!",1
This product does not work at all . Waste of money .,1
Length is ok. A tad snug around the chest/leg area. Doesnt droop around belly. Seems warm enough.,3
"I have had this for about a week now and it is great! It looks really nice. Assembly was pretty easy except attaching the top part was a bit tricky cause the instructions did not really show which way the hardware goes on and you do not want the top to open the wrong way. The bowls are huge and the height is perfect for my chow mix. This would still be perfect for even larger dogs. In order to open the storage area you have to take the bowls out, however, if you just store toys or treats in there you can easily reach them by reaching through one of the holes the bowls sit in. I can only recommend this and if I had too I would buy it again.",5
I bought this as a gift. Leash is strong and should last a long while.,5
My pup's love these.,5
Smaller than anticipated and cat showed absolutely no interest....,2
Cat hated it. She's picky. Not sure what flavor to try next. Hard to please some cats.,1
... Kong really needs to make one a little smaller.  Next size down is too small.,4
"Lovely, secure collar for my little Yorkie!  I was searching for a collar that had a bell, since she likes to hide.  This was just the perfect size for her and her tags attach very easily.  Highly recommend.",5
Very nice,5
GREAT FIT AND FINISH- EASY INSTALL. USING IN MY GARAGE FOR MY 95LB 1 YEAR OLD MALE GERMAN SHEPHARD! WORKS GREAT FOR HIM. MAY NOT WORK FOR LARGE SUPER ANXIOUS DOGS THAT JUMP AND CHEW! I LOVE IT FOR MY APPLICATION AND RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.,5
We set it up and within 1 day they refused to use the smaller old litter box so we ordered another and are excited for it to be here.,5
"After trying some other tighter seat covers I settled on this more practical version for my pets. It is just as described and I love it! This cover is made of thick, high quality material and cross stitching so it isn't easy to tear. My dogs can jump right up into the front seat and be pretty rough with it and I haven't had any problems. It has an adjustable strap with a pinch release clip to go around the joint at the head rest and one at the bottom to wrap around the back of the seat. It can be taken off in a few seconds and shaken out before someone else gets in the car or a plume of fur gets in your air vents (my life). It's easy to wipe off, although I will avoid washing it too often so it doesn't lose it's shape. I have two dogs and it does ride up a little with them crawling around, mainly in the middle area where the two parts of the seat come together. And the fur from my long haired dog (chi/pug mix) does stick to the material a bit so it doesn't come off very easily with the vacuum. I've had better luck rubbing it down with a static based fur removing fabric brush. I would definitely purchase this again and am thinking of the same thing for my back seat...",5
"These run super small. Even using the measurement guide, I ended up with one that was too small for my shihtzu. They are well made and super cute... I wish they came in larger sizes for all dogs... and ran true to measurements... I sent them back.",2
THUMB'S UP,4
The best price and fast shipping for a trusted product that I give my pet everyday!,5
"Okay, so I definitely underestimated the size of this thing! It's very tall and pretty hefty! My cats have been scratching at my new chair for weeks now, even with double sided no-scratch tape on it. I have many scratch posts around the house but only flat ones in the living room. My boys love to scratch vertically so I needed a tall post for them to stretch on. They immediately started using this post when I put it together and they haven't scratched my chair since! My 8 year old cat had all four paws on it scratching, hanging like a monkey! I like this material better than some carpeted posts because I'd rather not have my cats confused and scratching my actual carpet. Plus, it's actually quite nice looking for a cat post!",5
Fur fighter is the best thing I have found for cat hair on furniture and drapes (if heavy fabric drapes - not for delicate fabric).  This refill is the most economical.,5
"The scent of feces and litter had deodorizers built in already but, I wanted to eliminate the smell all together. Adding this to the mix was just aweful. The litter box smelt like flowers and garbage. I clean the litter box daily and the smell became too overwhelming I had to change the litter completely. Don't use if you have a sensitive nose!",1
"I got this for my dog who always wears a harness because it gives me better control of him - he's dog-reactive so he can be a challenge sometimes. It's a lot more comfortable for him than those harnesses that are just raw straps, but this is pretty lightweight so I'm not sure I trust it. The mesh part is great, but the back strap is kind of chintzy. I don't think I'd trust it if he started freaking out on me (which happens).

For a non-freaky dog this would work. The mesh front is soft and comfortable for them, better than the raw straps of many harnesses. Just wish the rest of it was a bit heavier.

Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",3
My puppy loves these vitamins! He thinks they are a treat!,5
"Love thundershirts, this is my second one.. easy transaction, great products",5
It was hard finding the exact size I needed for my Beagle but these were the closest.  They are super absorbent for urine and they have a lining that will prevent most leakage.  I love the resealable tabs that don't stick to hair.,4
Cats don't really care for the charmer. I have to play very hard to get some reaction from my feline overlords.,3
"I like the system as it is easier on my back.  However, my cat likes to scratch enthusiastically and break the poop up by scratching it after the event throwing some of the pellets etc out--easy enough to sweep up.  This leaves very small clumps that won't easily scoop. I can leave them, and scoop any large clumps--there is no odor, but it leaves brown pieces in the box, it is expensive to keep adding fresh or changing every couple of weeks, and unsightly. I like the idea of washing them but not sure whether I have the facilities--no stove, only microwave.  Have to think about that.  Everything aside, it is easier for me too use, and will keep it.",4
"Best choice CLUMP & SEAL!  COMPARISON TEST:  1st TEST:  Before finding CLUMP & SEAL... We tried Arm & Hammer Naturals, Multi-Cat Litter, 18 Lbs that is SO inferior-- it stays wet, stinks, and stunk up the garbage bin because it just stays moist, and stinks in the little pan because it just won't soak up the urine; also, SADLY, it WILL NOT CLUMP!  2nd TEST:  Arm & Hammer Feline Pine Original Litter, 40 Lbs.  This WORTH LESS stuff is still sitting in the garage, what to DO with it?  Arm & Hammer changed the RECIPE, as noted in many reviews... now it's in PELLETS, which are tough for the cats to walk on in the litter box, do NOT soak up urine, and are just sadly pathetic. We bought the ""Feline Pine"" because the bag of it we bought at Fort Bliss Commissary was wonderful-- clumped great and didn't stink.  We thought we were ordering the SAME ""Feline Pine"" but somewhere in there A&H changed the recipe (Read: ""RUINED"").  I was so happy we had found the pine product alternative to clay, before the pellets were foisted on us.  3rd TEST: Tried CLUMP & SEAL, quite reluctant to return to CLAY, but the cats love it, doesn't stink, doesn't have that HORRID PERFUME A&H uses in some kitty litters, and it CLUMPS MAGNIFICENTLY!  Back to clay we are, but it works.",5
Awesome product,5
"Prior to setting up and testing the Havahart Ultrasonic Basic Trainer, we used the E-328B Remote Control Training Collar with satisfactory results.  Attaching the collar and using the remote controller is/was a bit of a pain, as we did not want the collar continuously affixed to the puppy.  Chewing furniture and jumping on guests are the unwanted behaviors we are confronted with.  In addition to the 2 Duracell batteries included in the box, the Ultrasonic Basic comes with step by step operating instructions with some visuals, training tips and most importantly the toll free number to call for questions and issues seven days a week. The unit comes with a Lifetime limited warranty to boot.  Since we do not have a barking problem we started operating the Trainer manually with associated voice commands.. Although, using the automatic for excessive barking is the way to go!  The unit is simple to operate, and in our case works as advertised for the issues we have with the puppy - so far!  The Trainer has several neat easy to use features, i.e. auto mode and power on lights, frequency selector and manual correction buttons, and a low battery light. However, while the operating instructions are sufficient, we found the following link to a youtube video an invaluable instructional aid.  [...]
Overall, this is an excellent replacement of the collar and remote control system we have being using.  A slick system - recommended.",5
"i would recommend this product, but it will be a good add-on to your daily partial water change, if you are struggling with high Nitrate. I had nitrate of 160, started changing water daily and used Nitra-Zorb to pull it down to 40 within a week.
Also if you recharge it before first use then efficiency will increase. Instruction says to wash it before first use, i did but i was shocked seeing it turned tank water cloudy immediately as soon as i put it in my HOB filter, but don't worry within 24 hour your filter will clean the water again.
Partial water change is the key to fix Nitrate, Nitra-Zorb definitely helps in emergency situations.",5
I have 3 cats and all 3 continued to throw up while they were on this.  Had to stop feeding this to them and go back to their normal food.,2
"I've had it a little over a week, and my cat and I love it.  The only sound it makes is a little bit of splashing sound as water flows into the bowl.
Only improvement I would suggest is for the parts to fit more exactly.  There's a lot of wiggle room to seat the top part over the bowl, adjusting the position of the filter cage beneath it, and if you don't get the bubble hole aligned properly over the pump's outlet tube, you don't get a good flow.  Play with it a little bit and you'll find a good seating for the pump and the top part.",5
"My picky eater seems to like the flavor. Too early to tell long term results, but seems to be helping with her soft stools. Great price!",4
Not much to say. They both really love them and it keeps them busy for a while. I would buy again,5
its ok price is good but not the best out there,4
The dogs seem to like like them just fine. Not sure if them benefited them though. I feed Blue Buffola as well. Between the two I couldn't tell how well they did with out the other. We since purchase differnet vitamins that contain more then these. These at the time were priced right but I find them hard to order due to availablitity. I think we will stay with the other brand now.,4
This is pretty tough. My German Shepherd doesn't play with it too often but he hasn't damaged it yet when he does.,4
Good value on Amazon deals EXCEPT my cat has decided she now doesn't like the chicken flavor and flatly refuses to eat it..So it's no a dog snack or it gets donated to the animal shelter.  I've just ordered the Seafood Pate pack but it's more expensive ( don't understand this since it's the same # of cans),4
Exactly as described.  This item was well made and durable - easy to use. It was well packaged and arrived on time.,5
"Works well, makes the cuticles really soft and you only need very little.  Will buy again!",5
Plenty of room. Packs up easily. Carrying case is nice when traveling.  Fits in large suitcase.,5
Good as always,5
this works really well. I cannot BELIEVE how much hair comes off the cat with this great tool. Cuts way down on the shedding mess.  GET one!,5
"Makes walking two dogs amazingly easier!  No more untwisting leashes, or stepping over one or looking like I'm doing the doggie sidestep!  If you have two dogs... You NEED this!",5
"I have a cat and a dog that both sleep in crates at night. I find my cat often curled up in her crate when I am using these pads (or in the dog's crate if he's the only one that has one at the time). I found that the sizes were a little off for the plastic crates that I have for them, but this size fits perfectly when folded in half and gives them a little extra padding as well.

The fuzzy side can sometimes be a little warm for my Maltese (who has a very hot nature) but this is also true with terry cloth towels, he gets hot with practically anything next to him. He does enjoy the padding and doesn't paw at it (like he does with other crate pads or towels) or fuss to get out of his crate before it's time, even when he is sleeping warmer.",5
"My dog loves them, only thing is that I haft to rip to into threee pieces cause they aren't bite size for her she's a chihuahua!!! But other than that she absolutely loves them and they are much better for her than those cheap ones I used to buy her at Walmart!!",5
"I have a 7 lb Pomchi puppy and she is learning how to walk on a leash. This harness really has helped her to walk with me, not tugging to get ahead of the pack (myself and our larger Goldendoodle)! My Goldendoodle also uses a larger version of this harness and I swear by it! While it may be a little pricier than the other harnesses out there, it is worth every penny!!",5
"Well made, cat loves it, item as described, great seller!",5
"I bought this because my dog's best dog friend has one and she kept stealing it, so she clearly loved it! However, when I ordered our own, it smelled VERY strongly of rubber. It smells so strongly that my pup barely touches it, which is a shame because it would be much better for a game of tug than most of the things she tries to play with. Washing it with dish soap had little to no effect. As time passes the smell is fading, so hopefully in another month or so it will be her favorite toy...",4
Should get another one for myself!,5
"This bird feeder is very well made, solid and sturdy.  I chose to hang mine on a shepherds hook, right in front of my window. I have some cheaper bird feed, I was worried the feed would go right through the mesh bottom, but it didn't. So, you can use the cheap bird feed. In the summer I use the hook for flowers, so I will change the bird feeder to a stand.  I like that you can remove the mesh, it is very easy to remove and easy to slide back into place.  It usually takes a few days for the birds to find a new bird feeder, so I haven't seen any birds yet. I am very pleased with this bird feeder. I received this item at a reduced price for my truthful opinion.",5
"If they insist on treats, and it's hard to say no ... this is a good alternative. They get a little exercise trying to follow the treats around. Even the slowest kid eventually figures it out. Four cats, and I use two. I may get another ... don't want to give too many treats so I will need to be sure they're all getting some, but two may be a little too much sharing.",5
"My Pit bull/ Australian Shepherd loved this duck. He destroyed it after 5 months of sleeping with it. I had to get him another one, because it was so cute watching him carry it around and sleep with it.",4
great training treat for our dog. I cut the strips in 3/4 to 1 inch pieces.,5
"Yeah.  Dumb title, but it's past my bedtime!  My dachshund would recommend it!  It's soft all around with no rough or thin areas to chafe like we've experienced with some harnesses.  Noticed a little wear on the edges after it was worn for a couple of months, but overall, I think my dork's-hound is very happy with this product.",4
Been using this for years.,5
"Instinct Original Grain free dog food is good quality and my dogs love it. They wolf it down. Fast.

Tapioca is a lame filler, luckily it's the 9th ingredient. I knock one star off for including this nutritionally devoid ingredient, but it gets to keep 4 stars because it's the ninth ingredient. If you're curious about tapioca (also known as cassava root), just google ""tapioca in dog food"" and you'll get an earful about cyanide and how it's a crappy filler for some grain free dog foods.

Yes, my dogs love this, but I'm going to back to FARMINA dog food which has no fillers, great quality. It's expensive like this, but better ingredients, with no nutritionally devoid fillers.",4
"I bought this for the two TNR cats who live on my property. It fits perfectly on my covered porch where there's an outlet for the heated cushion. Plus, it's super easy to assemble. Good quality! The house works well here in South Florida because it doesn't get freezing cold in the winter. I wouldn't recommend it for harsh climates though. The cushion does get warm but definitely not warm enough for icy/snowy weather.",4
These are my dog's favorite frisbees. They are so easy to catch. He is a terrier mix and really gives them a workout.,5
love it,5
have to cut it up for gray he throws away big to hard. spoiled bird,3
This brushes the best brush I had bought for my poppy,5
"Yes- it does work as advertised. It keeps the water cold and our dogs love that! However if you have large dogs like we do- I'd wait to see if they come out with different sizes. This is great for my mom's pocket pup but our guys are 90# each and the waters gone like that-snap! Bought this combo so I could have an extra freezer insert not knowing it already came with one. So know I have 3... would have liked 1 less and a bigger bowl.
Also, the lip on the outside bowl(near the bottom) is already rusting. Great idea but could use some rework...",3
very thinly sliced,4
good price and serves it purpose,5
It's a scoop. In this house it gets heavy use and it holds up better than the plastic ones. I like that I can take it outside and pour boiling soapy water on it and keep it clean. We have three but I plan to get a few more as back ups should they ever stop making these.,4
"My Cats really like ""Friskies Cat food Classic Pate Salmon Dinner in Sauce"" one of the many Flavors that are Good for them and I get it Locally. My Cats get tired of eating the same Flavors too often so I have to try different ones all the time. Friskies Foods are Formulated to meet the Nutritional Levels Established by The Association of American Feed Control Officials ""AAFCO"" I have tried to give my Cats other more Expensive Gourmet Foods from Specialty Pet Shops and even the Pet Hospital where they have all those Bland and Pricey Foods, however, my Cats don't want any of that Food, they like to eat Friskies and they have it available to them all the time, Wet and Dry Foods.

"We now have three of these. You can hold your hand on the pad and feel the warmth reflected back. I don't know how it works, but it does work and we needed three so the two cats and the dog wouldn't fight over the first one.",5
Great tool for training a youg dog. Good quality and great price.,5
Cats won't touch it.,1
"Pros:
Ridiculously easy to clean.  Pop off the lid, tap it against the box to remove litter from grooves, scoop and done!  Litter doesn't stick to sides.

Perfect size.  Goldilocks's favorite litter box: not too big, not too small for the average cat.

Cons:
Doesn't diminish litter tracking any better than standard lidded models, especially if your kitties are jumpers.  Mine climb onto the lid (hole side against the wall) and rocket off into the sunset, litter flying off their toes.

Doesn't help control odor.  Fumes from ripe kitty packages, even covered ones, still waft out the top hole unimpeded.  I don't notice any difference between this box and unlidded boxes.",3
I love the brand Puppia. This harness runs smaller in the neck than an adjustable Puppia harness I purchased. But still a good harness just a little difficult to get over my pugs head.,5
This works really well... It's pricey but worth it ... I should have got the 180 tabs .. I didn't realize .. Oh and rhyme love the taste too ! Treat time :) the DMannose really is helping she was on just a cranberry one and I was told to try this .. I by fund it elsewhere .. Now I'm buying it here . Love amazon! Love these :),5
"Gave this seat 3 stars because I Never did figure out install instructions. However I created my own and it worked. I like this seat, more importantly my dog does too. She sits up high enough so that she can put her paws on my shoulder. She can turn around and look out the back window even when she has her safety clip on that comes with the seat.",3

"Ordered the hot pink S vest for a 5 month old, 7,5 lb, small unique breed pup. Arrived quickly, good condition.
The vest itself has a nice thickness, not too thin, perfect for sleeping in on colder nights, and walks after dark.
The color was as expected, very cute.
The fit is good, a mini tiny bit tight. If she grows at all it won't fit her anymore, I thought there was going to be a bit of room, but she's still not at her final size so, these things happen. If she does grow out of it I'll give it away and buy a bigger size, because it really does look great.
Pup is 3.4 kg/7.5 lb, measures 18"" head to butt, chest is 15"", neck 9"".",5
Quality and affordable at Amazon is what makes this great for me.,5
These bowls are perfect for my small dogs. I have a Yorky and Shih Tzu. It is nice that the bowl is not real deep. The price is great too.,5
My cat loves these and they're good for him.,5
"Our litter box sits in a small utility room with a vinyl floor.  Before the advent of the smartcatcher mat, there was litter strung through the utility room, out into the berber-carpeted house, as far as the door mat by the exit door used by the cat.  After six days with the box sitting on the smartcatcher mat, there are litter granules on the mat in front of the box opening, and NONE anywhere else in the house. We use Precious Cat clay litter, for reference purposes.
UPDATE --June 26, 2014-- Having used the mat for a few weeks, it looked like time to wash it.  I put it through my HE washer with some towels, using high spin and dried it in the dryer on medium.  It came out perfectly and it back on the job. I cannot say enough good things about this product.",5
"Used this to transport a Goffins cockatoo and a love bird via United Airline Petsafe travel. Worked well and with certain modifications I was able to make it meet the airlines standards. Had to add skateboard grip tape to the floor, foam padding to the top, mesh over the door and vents, and drill holes in the sides to attach perches. They did great and made it home safe and sound",4
"All of these dog bottle toys are hysterical! Sturdy, too! They've outlasted my chewers and are a great laugh. Thanks!",5
"My cat loves this food.  I've been feeding it to him in a couple of different flavors for 2 years now.  We made a complete quality diet switch to this and Spot's Stew grain-free dry 2 years ago, and I can say without a doubt that his health has improved significantly.  Even our vet remarked, at a recent check up,  how healthy he was for 16 years old and how shiny his coat is.  I have a Russian Blue and the typical balding spots at the temples, that they get with age, have actually filled back in somewhat!

In the two years I had only one case that seemed a little hard and dried out... Amazon replaced immediately and sent a free return label.",5
These made our dog sick because she ate them as snacks.,1
Perfect for difficult shrimp that need low ph..,5
"I bought this unit not for a treat, but to slow down eating habit of one of my cats. I don't have problem of the unit being kick down like others say. My young kitten know how to get kibbles out (make if fall down), but the older cat (my ""dry food only"" eater) doesn' know how to get food out. Perhaps, she isn't hungry enough.",3
"My cats all love these, although they were purchased for an older long haired cat.  They seem to help, or at least get his mind off of it!  My cats are not fans of most treats, so I was happy when they all like it (and try to get into the package if I'm not there).",5
High-value treats that are excellent for training. Some pieces are quite large so you might need to break them up to make them smaller!,5
"After years of frying liver for my dogs I was delighted to find this from Rocco.  I was a bit skeptical of what I would get, but I am so happy to say this liver treat is GREAT.  I break it up in smaller pieces and use it as a very special treat when they come pestering me for some big lovin'.  You will not be disappointed with the product.",5

"Got a 42' for our 56 lb husky, it's great! Love we can collapse it for storage, and he has plenty of room! He is tall and lean but he can fully lay down in it! Loves that I put a blanket over it, making it kind of his own cave. If your worried on size like I was, this is a great size for medium dogs! I will try to update it with him laying in it, he loves to go in there when we are home.",5
It is a nice soft toy for inside but it didn't work out for our dog.  He's a chewer and was able to tear it up.  We just have to stick to Kong toys for him.,2
My cat did not like very much,2
Helps my dog with her dementia and arthritis.,5
I have used this product for 2-3 months on both my Doberman Pinschers.  The reason I decided to try it was because one of them was suffering from a skin allergy.  It worked great on him.  They both love the taste of it.,5
Thank you for a great product,1
"Excellent price for the size, high end food. My 2 cats love it. No complaints.",5
"Either your cat likes it or hates it. One of mine turns her nose up at it, but luckily, the one with the bad breath tends to like it...though he also uses it as a toy for a bit before eating. There's no ""smell"" to them either, like some other treats, so that's a good thing!",4
great,5
Works as expected.,4
"I've tried several sizes of this harness on my 30lb beagle/coonhound. They've all reduced pulling in various degrees, and they keep my dog from choking himself while trying to pull, so they deserve praise for that alone.

However, I will say I'm pretty disappointed with this product by itself. The first harness we tried (a medium) had a shoulder strap proportioned perfectly to fit around my dog, but the chest strap couldn't be tightened enough, and so even though it did prevent pulling, it was primarily because the chest strap kept falling down over my dog's legs, preventing him from moving his front legs very effectively. We decided to try another size when the strap actually caused my dog to trip and fall on some stairs. We tried a small and a small-medium, and settled on the small/medium, which proved to fit the best, though even when it seems like it should be perfectly tight, the chest strap moves up and down, restricting my beagle's leg movement.

I was ready to ditch this harness and try something else, when I had the idea to leave his regular neck collar attached, and attached the leash to BOTH the harness and regular collar. By doing so, the collar keeps the chest strap of the harness from moving down, while the harness prevents pulling and doesn't allow my dog to choke himself on the regular collar. This combination has proven to be pretty much perfect for us, so I like the product, but without the additional collar, I think this product feels incomplete (at least for my dog).

Every dog is shaped differently, and these harnesses seem to work great by themselves on larger dogs and smaller dogs, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt. If you have a medium dog, though, I would highly recommend trying the method I mentioned with both the collar and harness attached together- its made walking my dog a LOT more enjoyable.",4
Cats Love it ! And they like chewing it up too.,5
"really easy to pick up the litter and it helps a lot with the odor, good size,.",5
"Works great, smells great, great price",5
"My cat LOVES it, but it's a bit flimsy for all the use it gets.  The horizontal bar which holds the string out from the door (etc) is not so well attached to the base, and it will eventually break. It's a tiny plastic tongue-in-groove device that will break in a heartbeat unless your cat weighs less than a bread loaf.  I've bought two so far now, and this second one i'm reinforcing that bar with duct tape before it even gets put on the door.

Also of note, MEASURE THE THICKNESS OF YOUR DOOR.  This thing is made for older or regular THIN doors... not the new 1.5 inch or thicker closet doors they put into new or luxury construction these days.  All the doors in my apartment (closet or otherwise) are 1.75"" thick and so I've had to create a custom door mount for this one.  I literally break the base and (again) duct tape it to a 'universal' over-the-door mount that is made for thicker doors.  What would we do without duct tape?",3
"Although our dog is more gifted than most (isn't everyone's?), she took to these stairs with practically no training--ascending and even descending. While she still has enough hind leg strength to make it up on our tall mattress from the floor, she willingly uses the stairs more often than not. If she's not chasing a cat, she seems to appreciate going down the stairs and sparing her 11-year-old ""wrists"" from concussing on the floor.",5
"Bought this with the hose attachment one because i didn't think it would work. I use the attachment emptied it, and it made a huge difference. The next day i went over the area again and now no more smell. My dogs still use same area and i am going on 1 month with no odor.",5

"This is a high-quality dog food. My dog loves it!
My only complaint is that this brand always hides dented cans in the center of the flat as if I won't eventually discover them.",5
Works about as well as a bath mat or rug.  Not worth the price.  I wouldn't by it again.,2
"I have two cats, one was a little scared at first, but the other one took right to it and will even lay beside it on occassion when it is hot.  Now they both love it, when I first set it up, it did make a sound, but after a week when I went to clean it, I realized that is makes that sound if it is not completely full.  Now the loud sound that others complain about is gone, you have to make sure that not just the reserve part of the fountain is full but also the main container level matches water level as well. Cleaning it once a week is best, since fur can get caught as well as food bits in the main fountain.  But it is a really good fountain, it was so good that I got one for my moms new kitten!",5
"One pig.  Just one. It's a shame, because this would be a 5 star review, except for the fact that the ad is so misleading.  I read every word of this ad, and no where does it state I would only receive one lone pig for my $7.  In fact, it states ""multiple colors.""  Complaint filed.",1
"I think it is good but I want to see if it holds up over time. I had another kind similar and it had metal gromets and latches and I thought it was going to last a very long time, but the gromets pulle lose and it was ruined.
They need to be reinforced on that one, This one looks better reinforced.",4
"I have a teeny-tiny, 5 lb. minpin/chihuahua mix, and incredibly enough, the XS was too small for him.  As many other reviews state, the chest size is fine.  The head size is just too restrictive, and cannot be adjusted.  I had to go to a size S, and that worked.  The chest is a little loose now, but not enough that he can wriggle out of it.

All of that said, I'm rating this 4 stars because the construction appears sturdy, it's handsome, and most of all, my dog likes it and seems very comfortable in it.  The dark brown is a very handsome shade; I'd almost call it a dark brown/taupe color.

If it weren't for the head size problem, this would get 5 stars.",4
Hated it. Sent it back. Never got the money.,1
Not as I expected I thought it tri-fold  but I looked at a lot so I might have gotten confused. It is big and bulky and does take up some room in my SUV. That said having a large dog I do not think anything thinner or narrower would have worked. Only problem is teaching an old dog a new trick to walk the plank into the car. My younger one does it just fine tho.,3
"I have a picky border collie mix who is a bit of a delicate flower.  Rescued and timid by nature her training has been quite a learning experience as my previous dogs were always gung ho about play and would move first, think later!

Not so my pup - she carefully watches, calculates and plans every move.  She does nothing even remotely assertive and will always relinquish power to a human or other animal.  So much so that it was growing problematic and she was fearful in many situation.  Knowing that one of the ways to make a timid dog a little more assertive is through play and especially play tug of war I really worked on getting her to engage.  But the traditional rope games baffled my girl - if I was pulling on the rope she thought I wanted it and would graciously release it (always looking slightly confused because of course I'd been encouraging her to take the other end only to pull it back - the borders can be a bit judgemental with their smarts).

And then, a couple of years ago, I found Foxy at a local store.  She loves him.  Really really loves him.  Although she'd never growl at me she will hang on for dear life and she loves that he squeaks on either end.  He's fun to throw and catch, hide, and most of all to tug on.  She'll carry him around and play with him on her own.  She bounces into the room with him in her mouth and challenges me to get him from her.

I went back to the store and bought the 3 remaining Foxys they had.  3 years later (she's gentle on her toys) I was trying to find him again and was thrilled to find him reasonably price on Amazon.  I'm going to try never to run out of this toy - It's fantastic and was a game changer for her.

She even gets a little bossy with her mates when they come over and look at Foxy!  I couldn't be happier.

It has absolutely changed how she plays with me and I can now rough house with a few of the rope toys and she'll understand and play the game a bit better so it made play much more fun for her.",5
"I like it. It's very soft and warming to my cat. She won't climb in it like the cat in the picture. The opening won't stay open and she won't go inside. But she sits on top of it happily and if she likes it, I'm happy. The crunchiness at first bothered me, but now when I hear it in the dark, I know one of my cats is there and enjoying the bed. I gave it  4 stars because it won't stay open by itself.",4
"Despite issues with shipping due to a ice storm, it arrived before I ran out and my dog seems to love it.",5
Love this cat litter mat! It was recommended by my neighbor.  I had a cat a few years ago and recently adopted another and cat litter tracking was my least liked thing about owning a cat. This mat is so much better than any of the ones I had tried before. The mats do a great job of trapping the larger pieces of litter. I liked it so much that I bought 2 more so I could practically fill up my closet with them (to minimize the area uncovered to make sure she walked on these). The dark color plus light litter dust makes it obvious where she walks.  Some may not like that but for me it will be more obvious to know when to clean them. I did vacuum in the areas where I used to have a lot of litter in the carpet and there was hardly any. I'm hoping with the addition of these there will be even less. Oh and I now scoop over the mat into the litter genie to contain anything I drop in the process. (The cat litter is supposed to be 99.9% dust free. Haha),5
stoped working unplug for a day or two its better,4
"This dish is a nice size, I like that I don't have to worry that my dog will run out of water, however, the pump is junk!! The first one blew after just a few days, I called customer service at Petsafe and they sent out a new one, no questions asked. The new one blew within a week. I was sure to clean it out every couple of days, even though the customer service rep at Petsafe recommended once a week. We are still using the dish, but it isn't a filtered water dish anymore because I am not continually replacing pumps.

If you want a really nice size standing water dish, this is a good choice, but don't expect the pump to last at all",1

Our pets know what they like far better than we do. Not saying it is a bad product by any means. To me, the price and likeability to my dog, doesn`t jutisfy the price. I also m not so sure animals don`t need grain or such as they will eat many organic things such as grass, flowers, weeds, shrubs, tree leaves etc. At least mine does. She tears my greenery up and chews on it and brings it in the house more so for reasons othan than just eating it.",4
very well build cage only need's to be bigger,5
"This was well-worth the price.  The sisal is in a woven-pattern rather than rope wrapped around.  It is nice and tall.  The cats can really stretch.  Mine like to stretch to the top with their feet off the ground.  I have a blind cat that loves to climb to the top and then circles around it like a gymnast.  The base is very sturdy. It is heavily used daily by 4 cats.  I believe due to the quality of this product it will hold up better than any cat scratcher that I have previously purchased.  I am almost hesitated when I first saw it and decided to give it a chance (I liked that the cats could stretch, most of their scratching posts are short).  It was better than expected.  I would purchase again.",5
"I am 5'2"" to wear size 4 and the waist belt gives me plenty of room between clips, (actual belt buckle moved to the back), about 10 inches for the leash to move side to side.  I don't wear it totally tight around my waist because I want it more comfortable so it lays on my hips. I have a 2 year old German Shepherd Dog who sometimes pulls on leash so I like the strength of the bungee. It's tight enough but also gives a little bit, but not so much that she can lunge away out of control.  I also like that I can unclip at the belt so I can use it only as a leash and I can also grab the handle closer to the her collar I need to, or lengthen the waist belt and attach it around a tree, etc. to tether her for a moment.  Very versatile.  I've been hiking with the tuff mutt it was perfect for hands free walking on the trails and I would certainly buy it this leash again if I needed to replace a lost one.  Seems to be well made and strong.",5

"I like the washable cover but my dog likes to ""scratch burrow"" as I like to call it before he lays down. When he did this he ended up tearing a hole in the under cover that holds the memory foam in. I was super surprised to find that the memory foam was basically a bunch of scrap pieces of memory foam in different sizes and colors.... can't really wash the bed itself. The description makes it sound like its one big piece of memory foam. I'm still finding the chunks of foam around my house",3

I bought this one as it looks like a new version and is described to work similarly to the old model.  I put it on my dog Wednesday afternoon before taking him to my sister as we were heading out of town for the long weekend.  My dog was used to a bark collar, so the training process was unnecessary.  When we returned 5 days later, I found my dog's neck to be raw and burned, especially around the area where the contacts primarily touched his skin (and no, I didn't have it on too tight. The collar was snug and you could easily slip two fingers under the collar without causing him discomfort).  My sister said he never barked all weekend, that he stayed curled up on the couch and wouldn't even go outside.  He has longish hair around his neck so she couldn't see the damage it was doing.  It wasn't until I came to pick him up and noticed his odd behavior that we figured it out.  This product shocked him even though he wasn't even moving. The safety feature that is supposed to keep it from continuously shocking the dog clearly does not work.  I will never purchase another PetSafe product ever again.  Not even if they reimburse my vet bills for antibiotics and pain meds.  Very, very disapointed.",1
"I add this into my fish tank after every water change.
I like to keep a 4 gallon bucket with pre-treated Nutrafin Cycle Bio. Filter Supplement water, just in case of an emergency.",4
"I foster dogs for 2 different rescues, and this product does exactly as it claims! When we get dogs from the shelters or abusive situations they often have liquid stools. We feed them quality kibble and it can be hard on their systems at 1st. This works great in getting their stools back to the proper consistency.",5
I have two long haired cats. One of them was struggling badly with hairballs that were getting trapped in her stomach and intestines. We tried pretty much every brand of hairball treatment ointment but my cats refused to eat them. We bought different hairball control wet food and my cats STILL refused to eat them. We bought this and finally my cats ate this and were able to pass the hairballs! I now have happy cats again!!,5
"I put this break-away collar on my 4 month old kitten.  Thankfully I was home when I noticed my kitten was being strangled by the collar because it did not break-away.  He got his arm through the excess fabric loop which subsequently made the collar so tight that it was strangling him.  I foster kittens and this is the first brand of break-away collar I have had trouble with.  It seems as though the breakaway takes too much force for a 4 month old kitten to break through.  Thankfully I was home to hear him gasping for air, but it could have ended a lot worse!",2
love it!,5
"I really like undergravel filters for filtration.  It's old school tech and if you go with some plants, it will fertilize them.  I've had systems setup where I didn't have to change water for 6 months because of the balance between plants and the filter.  Just topping off.  Just beware of some of the colored gravel.  I bought some from petco that broke down in 2 months and mass killed all the fish in my tank.  I've got the filter in another tank with different gravel and it's working fine.",4
Perfect size and color. Fits her really well! She cries when we take it off. My puppy loves her puppia! :),5
"My cat loves it! As long as I'm careful to thoroughly mash the peas and carrots,
she'll eat it all. Otherwise, she eats around the veggies! She's very picky - she
only eats canned food with salmon.",5
Love Science Diet for my puppy.  Have used it for YEARS with no complaints.  So much cheaper to buy it from Amazon.  Add the fact that I don't have to lug the 30 pound bag home from the store and we have a WINNER!,5
Another awesome goDog toy that my dog hasn't succeeded in killing!!!,5
i feed to every tank i have and all types of fish devour it.does not cloud the water and excess can easily be removed.,5
"This is the best harness I have purchased for my Toy Fox Pinscher.  I slip it over her head, and she lifts her paw through the leg opening.  Then I fasten it around her belly and clip it together.  It is lightweight and she prefers it to any of the other harness items I have tried.",5
"PERFECT, GREAT QUALITY, LOVE THIS PIN.",5
"My cat loves the canned variety of this food.. same brand, same flavor. She hated the dry food that was a different brand and grain-free. I believe the canned food of this variety IS grain-free, and that's why I wanted to try the dry version. We were trying grain-free to see if she puked a little less (not that she does it anymore than any other cat). So although I was bummed to see that the dry was not grain-free, Gertie (my cat) loves it. I cannot give it 4/5 stars because it's not grain-free. It's cat food, and my cat loves it. To my surprise (seriously), she often leaves the wet food behind and chooses to eat the dry that we leave out for her. I will absolutely be ordering this (and the canned) again.",5
"The perfect pet travel carrier that i use tor my 2 poud pup, she sleeps in it at work and it is sturdy and very light weight. I got this size to give her room.",5
"Goes off at random and motion doesn't activate it. I've tried two sets of batteries thinking that was the problem, but it didn't help. Don't know if I got a dud or if it's the can or what, but it's completely useless.",1
Easy and affordable way to put trace elements for my aquariums. Works great,5
It works really well in dogs,5
The best catnip toys ever!!,5
Lamar is picky but he ate all of this at one sitting.,5
A wonderful treat for your dogs...mine love them as as special treat.,5
"The rubber ring around the bowl comes off easily...

Not great quality",3
"5"" Russian tortoise loves her home. She's used it several months now. She also likes to climb it for some reason. Anyway, super cool, plenty big. Two thumbs up.",5
I had a coon hound with liver and kidney problems and was put on this which did work pretty well. She died of a metastasized cancer in her lungs but this kept her liver readings fairly normal. This is the same as SAM-E and thistle seed extract that you can by cheaper. but that's up to your budget.,4
"I found out about this brand on a pet food ranking website and after I found out about what was in my current dog food, I thought it was a perfect time to change. This rated among the highest for quality of products and the least amount of fillers and grains.
We have 2 standard poodles.  They are not picky eaters by any means, however one of them has a severe chicken allergy. We've tried many expensive ""vet recommended"" brands and they simply don't like the taste of them.
 We have to feed lamb and rice to combat the allergy problem.  This does have chicken fat in it as one of the ingredients, but as it doesn't contain chicken protein, our parti is fine with it.
The kibble is smaller than what I thought it would be, so it would be great for smaller dogs as well.  Mine are both over 50#.  I like the fact that this is almost completely digestible.  Their stool is much smaller than with other foods.  They free feed from the same bowl and I find that 4C of food lasts more than 2 days for them.  It fills them up and satisfies their hunger.
 They're also not as gassy on this brand either.
I keep some in a slow feeder bowl and they graze throughout the day. Its tasty for them and they think its a treat when its in the 'fun bowl'
For the price, this food is a winner.  I'll keep buying it.",5
"The size is too small. I bought the XL for my 60 lb Golden-Doodle and it is too small for him. The length is ok but the width is narrow.
Your dog wll not be comfortable if he lies on his side like mine. My 25 lb Border Collie is the right size for it. I tried to return this but they have not responded to my emails. I found out I have to pay the return shipping myself which will cost me almost $50 ground shipping for 14.7 lbs.
Partial product credit is provided for products removed from original packaging. Instead of wasting $60 MORE dollars I kept it. My dogs have not used it yet.",1
"I bought this for my White German Shepherd.  She sheds nonstop all year long.  We have dark wood floors, so her white hair is easily visible.  I vacuum constantly! I didn't want to pay $60.00 for that furminator brush because that is insane to spend on a dog brush, and I heard it irritates the skin.

When I first used this I had hope.  It took off a lot of hair, and seemed to work like a really good wire brush.  There were two problems that occurred though.

1-This brush only has 1 row of teeth, which is fine, but the row is so shallow that with one swipe, a small amount of hair would completely cover the teeth.  Therefore with every swipe you had to clean the hair off or it wouldn't work.  It takes FOREVER to brush a dog if after every swipe you have to ""empty"" the brush.

2-This did nothing to stop my dog's shedding.  Despite it took off a lot of hair, within a day my dog was shedding all over again.",3
"This cardboard piece is very expensive but the cats do love it and use it constantly.  I am trying to have lots of scratch posts around to keep them away from the furniture, and this helps.",4
great stuff,5
My mom's cats love this brand of catnip so I thought I'd get this for them as a treat. They loved it! It's so fun watching them go crazy over the catnip. Mom puts it away between play sessions so they don't get bored of it... It's truly fun for the whole family!,5
"We feed our cat mostly wet food, but we treat her to kibble/treats once a day during lunch time. This bowl definitely stopped our cat from woofing down her treats, and she seems to enjoy digging out the treats with her paws. The bowl is way too big and deep, and I couldn't imagine trying to feed her wet food from this bowl as others have claimed.",4
Exactly how advertised I am very happy with this purchase,4
"My two feral cats  adapted to this pretty well, gave them somewhere to go with the perches when I cleaned their cat boxes and fed them. They could observe the other cats while still feeling safe and see that maybe the world wasn;t as bad as they thought it was going to be..",5
"they work nicely, but don't seem to last long.",4
Love them.,5
"If you have an overactive kitten or cat, this is hours of playtime.  It really will wear them out.",5
"We started feeding this to my dogs last week, and so far the results have been great. I have two picky dogs, an 11 yr old cairn and a 1 yr old small terrier mix. Neither one of them have ever been too excited for a meal, and often times would turn them down. I began feeding them this food...and bam! No more skipped meals and no more picky eaters. My only complaint is that it makes my little guy a bit gassy. :/ for the amount of time and money I have spent trying out other foods with no success, I would definitely recommend Taste Of The Wild venison!!!",5
"This is one of many purchases I have made of Pup-Peroni as my dog, Terminator, a  tiny minpin, just loves it.  It is soft so there is no problem eating it even for small dogs and dogs with bad or missing teeth. The price on this order (pack of 5) was good, so good they sold out and I can't order it again until they get it in stock again.  Terminator waits patiently for me to leave as he knows when I leave he will get a Pup-Peroni treat.",5
"I buy these every year for my parents two kitties who are indoor/outdoor and sleep in the garage. Combined with their favorite bed (cardboard boxes), the two semi-elderly pets stay warm in during the winter and continue to use them on cooler nights during the other seasons. (Live in the SE US, so relatively mild winters) They are very much attracted to the fabric, and get excited when you're setting up/refreshing their beds.",5
Great,5
bird did not like them at call but my daycare kids did. So not a total loss. :),5
Great product. It is easy to use and fits well in my hand.,5
"We started house-training our puppy with Arm & Hammer puppy pads from Target. He took to them pretty well and was going if not on, within the general vicinity of, the puppy pads. As they were no longer on sale, we decided to try Out. Bad idea.

I don't know if the scent or the feel of the Out puppy pad was different enough from the Arm & Hammer for our puppy to avoid regularly using it or if he just didn't like it. We continued to put it down but he would use it in an unpredictable manner. Luckily, our older dog has been a role model of sorts and he usually goes outside now but he still occasionally has accidents. The pads are definitely absorbent and we use them for the accidental whizzes as well as when the puppy decides to play with/in a full bowl of water.",4
I have 3 dogs and this product works great .they can go outside and I don't have to worry,5
Our beagle pup took a couple of weeks to warm up to this toy but now adores it. I had the end of a bully stick chewed down to the May Be Choking Hazard stage and jammed it in one of the round openings. It extended the interest life of the stick another two weeks. (Your mileage may vary of course.),4
"My old, almost 16 years old, dog loves these. They are soft enough for her to chew. She's an incredibly picky eater and if she could, she'd probably live on these...well maybe she does because she barely eats any of the other incredibly expensive food I try to feed her.",5
This food is perfect for my dog. He has a gluten allergy and it is tough to find food that is grain free. He seems to really enjoy that taste as well!,5
"My puppies hate them! They are not very chewable, and they both vomited shortly after taking them.",1
Both of my cats would not eat these treats,1
Ordered Grey but it came in brown. Wobbles but what's to be expected at that price,2
"My cat is quite thin, but he has a very long body and really long legs. People often say he's the longest cat they've ever seen. This litter box fits him perfectly, and it'd work for overweight cats as well. Two regular sized cats could fit in here, if you have a multi-cat home!",5
Did not work as advertised just using it as a treat now...would not recommend,2
"Kitty's like it or they prefer what they do but will eat up on something Friskies sell's as the company goes, my Cat liked Salmon, wouldn't eat Turkey & Giblet at all, he's ok with the Mixed grill most times, Friskies, get large can, quality old time brand name, pay less. Delivery on time no probs.",4
"Gravy with meaty bites.  My two older cats lick their bowls clean.  After years of bad smelling fishy ground up mush - the smell of their meals is actually decent...and their breath improved.  Each can is the right amount to share between the two, so no messing with covering and refrigerating left overs.",5
Loved it fits perfect on my bullterrier.over 50lbs got the xl one.n its streaches n does not shrink when u wash,4
"I have five destructors.....er...dogs... of various shapes, sizes and ages......These dogs live to destroy.  It would be safe to say I have spent hundreds of dollars on various brands of dog ""toys""...........nearly all of which are either shredded or torn in seconds to minutes. Of course, the ones that have lasted the longest are the original Kong black. Even after a few months, I will find one with a few chunks out of it.  IMO, Kongs are money well spent.

In my quest for new and interesting, indestructible alternatives, I saw the Zogoflex Hurley at Homegoods of all places (only $7.99).  I actually passed on it the first few times I saw it thinking it wouldn't last. Eventually, I bought five and was glad I did! They are twice the price everywhere else.

Since then, the Zogoflex Hurley (black) has become a favorite toy to play with. They will actually chase each other crazily all over the yard trying to steal whichever one has it............despite that there are at least four of them scattered throughout the backyard. And although I don't see them chewing it for hours the way they do their Kongs, none of these toys have any chunks out yet!

So - if you have any destructor dogs at your house, this might be a good one to try!",5
my cats love these,5
My dogs LOVE Stella & Chewy's freeze dried raw food and this was such a great price that I couldn't pass it up.  I usually supplement their diets with a variety of different flavors.  Love this company and their product.  Great for picky eaters too!,5

I would have returned it to exchange for the next size up except it was covered in her dog hair after we tried it on. The handle works great.

"No temperature control but does a decent job of heating my 2.5 gallon beta tank. However, the suction cup doesn't work that well, it kept coming off the wall and once got pulled out of the water and exposed to air so now it's cracked and no longer working. When it was working, it heated the tank up about 3-5 degrees above what it was without a heater.",3
"Very sturdy and well-designed. My dog just plops down and falls asleep where she used to worry about falling into the footwells of my car. The fabric gives her a lot of traction.

Easy to adjust and tighten. Also very easy to convert for people to sit - it has some perfectly situated slits for seatbelt access. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a plain seat cover.",5
nice,4
i give these as nightly treats to my cats.  They LOVE them!,5
I think the very thing that makes it a little annoying to me is partly what my cat loves.  Its made of crinkly material and crunches when he plays in it.  Oh well.  Both my cats enjoy it.  There is a hole in the middle they pop out of like a jack in the box.  Too funny.  it folds up and stores nicely if I don't want it laying around on the floor (or at night when they seem to always want to play in it and I'm trying to sleep) ha ha,4
Worked excellent on my shih-tzu!!! Quiet so they didn't even scare him.,5
My chickens love it and gets here in 2 days.,5
great product,5
These are a great treat and keep my dogs entertained for long periods of time and also helps keep their teeth cleaner. These end up in several sections and pieces which offers still more chewing time and minerals. The Bone marrow is a great  source of vitamins and minerals. Don't be alarmed if your pet doesn't eat as much food after they eat the marrow asit is so nutrient rich...I love giving my dogs natural bones rather tha rawhides all the time...,5
Seemed to have done the trick. No complaints here,4
Looks great in my 10 gal. tank.,5
"Best pooper scooper, by far. Does not clog up... just scoop & dump.

Simple and cute. Perfect for all the toys to live in on the ground.,5
"Bought this when my cats were smaller, they are only 7 months now but look like they are a large breed. They both love it and can often be found in the cot sleeping. I bought a cheap blanket to put on it since the material isn't that inviting, they definitely prefer it covered. My only complaint is that I have had to reattach it more than I should, for the cost. I followed the directions fully and the cot has fallen while being used solo and shared. I have no comparison, so I can't say it is any better than a cheaper model.",4
Works awesome on my German Shepard.  Really pulls the loose hair out!!  I was skeptical but I'm so glad I tried it!,5
"a bit pricey, but it does stop the licking and helps heal.",4
"I loved this toy, but of the several large ones I bought, two had to be returned and replaced, due to lacking the grunting sound that dogs love. The small Plush Puppies are all fine and retain their sound (though the small ones do not have grunt sounds).
Otherwise, this is good, and the fact that replacements are immediately sent out is really great.",3
Its cute!  My cats love it!,5
Great fit for big chested 30+lb French Bulldog.,5
Not for us: The urine smell was too strong after one week. Only the solid waste was scoop able.,1
"This is a wonderful treat bag!  I use it for taking my dog on walks, playing at the park, and in doggy classes.  The opening at the top is large enough that I can easily get my hand into it, but not so wide or floppy that anything falls out if I'm moving around a lot.  It can fit a couple ziplocks of treats, a small ball, or other small items.  The pocket on the front is great for storing extra treats, a clicker, or a chain collar (to use at class).  The pockets on the side are perfect for holding little baggies to clean up after my dogs.  One of the things I like BEST about this bag is the clip!  It is strong and stiff enough that I can clip it to the waistband of my pants without using the provided belt.  (It clips well to pockets on larger bags, too.)  This works on everything from thinner leggings to thicker jeans and hasn't fallen off yet.",5
I use two to catch the inevitable scratching that causes leaks. Easy to dispose of with the drawstring tie.,4
cute,5
"Low calorie, tasty treats - pups love 'em!",5
Our dogs like this.,5
"I think these were more for me than for my dog. I hated the idea of using a prong collar, in spite of everything i've read and professional trainers assuring me that they do not hurt the dog. Putting these little tips on the prongs gave me a bit of peace of mind to begin to use the prong collar for training. If you're hesitant but need a collar to train, i suggest you get these.",5
"This has lasted us such a long time.  I actually really like the kiwi scent, and know that this isn't rough on my cats skin.  Would definitely recommend",4
Quiet running with good flow. Adapters provide for two diameter output tubes. Design allows for a low level of sump water.,4
"Will my Yorkies have been on this for a month now and sometimes we think it's working and then the next thing we know there right back at it again.
We even have the Potty Mouth tablets.
As our vet said we have a 50/50 chance of it working, they are now 3 mths old and it still doesn't work all the way.",1
"I take care of 5 dogs all at the same time... Three of the 5 need a squeaky tennis ball in their mouth , most of the time as a "" stress ball. "" The dogs love the balls...and long balls have lasted the longest.",5
"These bones last a LONG time. Toby, my dog, still hasn't made it through the first one but continues to chew it daily.",5
"Worked perfectly for my Boxer/Pitbull. Half of his nose had dried out very bad and now it's back to normal. I used it daily for about a week. I'm hoping it's permanently gone. We shall see!

UPDATE: Its been months and it stayed gone. His nose has not been dried out since! Would def recommend and would buy it again. Also a little goes a long way!",5
I use it as a double water bowl for my 2 German Shepherds and it is great.  Cut the mess down 70-80% not sure it is large enough for using water only if you have more than 1 dog as we have to fill it (both) several times a day now,5
Great for my lab mix but didn't work well for my Bloodhound.,5
Cat Loves this! Gobbles it down and seems to be helping with overall energy levels.,5
I purchased one for each dog and they both are head over heals for the Philly Cheese stake flavor. They have had the toys since Christmas and they are still in good shape considering they have been enjoyed everyday since. I am really pleased with how long they are lasting!,5
"Very happy with this litter; I'm a repeat customer.  pH indicator appears to be accurate - it changed color for one kitty who has alkaline urine problems, but remained unchanged for my other healthy cat.  Love that the litter is lightweight too.  The company has very good customer service as well.",5
Some of the teeth fell out soon after purchase and got stuck in a dog I was combing out. Dont recommend this comb.,2
Our puppy didn't have much of a complaint when we snipped her with these shears. They are good and sharp so they don't tug on the nail. I hope they last long!,5
"We have two cats and one cat liked these and the other wouldn't touch them.  The cat that liked them gobbled them up the first time, but after that ate only half her treats.  The have a meat like texture, and smell like something a cat would enjoy, so I was really surprised they both didn't love it.",3
Feels like styrofoam,2
"My dog loves this jerky. Small package good for about 4 servings for a smaller dog, or 3 for a bigger dog. Fair price.",4
it is what it is.,5
"The stray and feral cats I feed LOVE these. Even one that will not always eat the pate will gobble this right up. They also love to drink water out of the empty can as it mixes with the gravy that is left over. For some of the cats, this is the only time they will drink water.",5
Silent operation.  Easy to prime when you make sure the tubes are not longer than need be.,5
Good for preventing upper respiratory infections in my cats.,5
"Wish I hadnt bought it. Tooth brush works better at cleaning the main part of the fountain(the multiple holes in the bottom), and for cleaning the motor. Wash cloth works fine for cleaning the middle section. Really the only brush that comes in handy..and probably could have been purchased separately elsewhere, is the smallest one. Cleans the tiny tube that goes into the pump.",3
Not as durable as I had hoped,3
"Worked well at first application. Killed all aiptasia that I put it on and did not seem to effect my fish or coral. First application no side effects noticed. In two to three weeks some of the aiptasia came back killed 2nd time now they keep coming back every few weeks but fewer each time I had 10 now 4th time of killing, I now have 3 aiptasia, I have not seem any effect on fish or coral.

From Oct 2012 to Jan 2013
I killed two more today it controls but need to do every few weeks not a cure may need to keep this up forever?",2
"We received this item very quickly, so my complaint is more about the manufacturing of the product. Many of the pieces were bent to the point that we had to use a hammer to get them straight and to fit with the others properly. Unfortunately, since the cost of shipping to return this would be too great because it is so heavy, we just improvised and made the pieces fit.",3
"I have a wide opening in my living room that I needed to fence in for my puppy. There isn't many choices for such a wide opening I thought I would try this, it had to be better than the extra large cardboard box I was using!.  My puppy, now 22 lbs and 5 months, does not try to jump on it like he did with the cardboard - he can see through it so no reason.
I have it opened to the max width and it is not quite the 96"" as advertised. That could be due to the way I needed to install it due to the AC return being in the way. When it is extended all the way there is some give in the center, I would say 2 inch sway in either direction. I put my magazine rack on the outside so if he does run into it or jump on it it will not move.
It attaches to the wall with eyelet screws so be prepared to put holes in the wall.
This completely serves the purpose of containing the puppy to only part of the house and would recommend  it for tothers that have dogs that will not jump on it.",5
"Generally both of my dogs really LOVE a treat that has blueberries in it--actually most fruit.  This one not so much.  This is a very tiny size treat (if it isn't crumbled) so it's a good size for a little dog.  I have MiniPoodles--they just weren't all that nuts over these. Opening the bag they sure smell good!

I gave the bag to a friend and her dogs seemed to enjoy them...especially her little ChiMix",3
"I had the 32 oz. bottle of this product that ran out.  The price of the gallon was very good, only a couple dollars more than a 32 oz. bottle, so I bought the gallon size and refilled the 32 oz. spray bottle that I had.  My dogs are potty trained and rarely puke but my cats sometimes vomit light yellow foamy bile on the beige carpet.  I use a Hoover carpet cleaning machine on the yellow bile and then follow it up with some of this spray.  Sometimes the cats vomit a little bit of white foam that sits on top of the carpet and isn't watery and for that, I usually just use this spray with a scrub brush. I can't say whether it gets out stains because I haven't had that issue but it does work with odor.
For the last 6 weeks we have had a Yorkie/Maltese foster dog and she must have come from a home that used pee pee pads because she always peed or pooped in the same spot on the kitchen tile.  She needed potty training reinforcement and now she rarely has an accident in the house. I used to use this spray on the tile when she peed and pooped in kitchen and again, stains weren't a concern but odor was, and this worked.
Also, the bottle was packed in a plastic bag that was sealed with tape so if it opened up in transit, it wouldn't spill all over.  Luckily it arrived safely in two days with Prime shipping and no leaking.",5
Perfect harness for small dog.  Our dog has a trachea problem and we have been using Puppia harnesses for years and the only one we will use.  Is comfortable for the dog and easy to put on and does not choke her if you pull on the leash.,5
"My Macaw loves this!!!  It's so colorful and bright and she loves to try to hang from it--it's a riot, as she is huge in comparison...",5
"Perfect size for storing rabbit pellet litter.  Kept right next to pen, easy to access, holds a bag of pellet litter.  Rabbits chew on paper bag so putting the litter in the plastic container is a necessity.",5
Recommended by our vet but this is a better price.,5
"Not for heavy chewers or gnawers as a ""toy""--the ball is soft rubber.... but for some fetch.... if you are right there watching your furbaby and not letting them have it it like a treat..... it can make for some laugh-yourself-silly pic time with the furkids!!",5
The thin park has already been chewed half off in under 6 hours.  :(  expected more durability from a KONG product,1
"I have an Australian Shepherd, currently 11 weeks old. He loves these toys-especially the two with plastic. He's so-so on the rope, but that's ok; it's great getting a 3-pack with a puppy. I've had pretty good luck with Petstages products. Anything to get his attention from the curtains or couch corner.....",5
"Worked great for saltwater. Same product i always buy, except about 5 dollars cheaper. Awesome. Will be buying again.

Shipping was fast.",5

it`s a little bit sharp for my cat,4

"I have a 6 pound Havanese and doesn't have any room. If my puppy moves his head just a bit the zipper opens, which is very frustrating.",2
I have bought several dog collars like this from this company and they always come out perfect. I have never had a problem and I'm always very satisfied.  This latest coller is perfect. Great company to do business with too.,5
"Awesome product the best I've ever used. Highly recommend.
Keeps my pup happy & busy for hours",5
"So you're probably thinking that the motor died because I let the well dry out.  You would be correct.  However, I have had a Drinkwell pet fountain for 7 years that has run out of water many times through out its life.  I am not horribly irresponsible.  I just don't notice it is low before I leave the house, go to bed, etc. I wanted a second fountain for downstairs, so I could have one up and one down.

I bought this one because it got really good reviews and it is easy to clean. Cleaning my Drinkwell is a chore. However, I will buy another Drinkwell pet fountain despite it being difficult to clean, because it has given me its money's worth.

If you are extremely responsible and will never have the motor get dry, this may be a good machine for you.  If you are like me and sometimes forgetful, choose a more durable model.

****Update****
I read some others cleaned out the motor and their fountain started working again.  I decided to give it a try, and it worked. I now have a functional Cat Mate Pet Fountain.  I bumped my review to 3 stars, and I will monitor the fountain.  It appears that soaking the motor in vinegar for 30 minutes cleans off all the gunk. If it stays operational and a 30 minute soak every few weeks is all that is needed, I will revisit this review and give a higher rating.",3
Worked fine,5
"I bought due to the brand, Furminator has historically had good tools and quality. Not this time.

A total piece of junk here. Rubber handle rotates as you brush, so unless you hold on to the yellow part, the comb doesn't work and you end up getting tangled in hair. The rubber handle will also just pull off easily, separating from the rest of the comb. We have a border collie and a golden retriever, so long hair, tangles are a daily way of life on the bayou. Unless you have a short haired, inside dog, this is a waste of your time. Going to file a return request in just a few minutes and try again.",1
This mat is great. I have two deep set bowl that fit perfectly in the mat.  My puppy is a crazy eater. This mat catches all the food he tosses out of the plate.  The water does not seep through the mat when it spills as well.  I have two dogs but only bought this for my puppy since he gets food everywhere.  When place on the floor the rubber mat does not slide it sticks firmly in place. I am seriously considering buying one for my other since they are very nice.,5
"This stuff is cheap and doesn't work. When I got this product, the only button that worked was the button 2. Which was shock. No vibration or anything.",1
"Great price, my dog loves it !",5
FYI- these do not work for mealworms (which will eat their way into it.  But good for other creatures,5
"This little bed is super soft and a good, cozy for a very small dog. Our ex-small dog saw the detached bottom cushion as a mobile chew toy so we affixed two small velcro strips to it and the bottom of the bed and problem solved.",5
This lasted less that 10 min. with my 25lb. corgi mix.,2
"I've bought many of these at this point. The first one lasted at least 5-6 years. Then the pump got so loud I was nervous about leaving it on when I wasn't home. So I bought a new pump. It lasted about 3 months. Bought another pump. Lasted about the same. Then the whole fountain went on sale and I thought for all the money I wasted on replacement pumps at $17 a piece, I could and should just buy a new fountain. So I did. It arrived 9/11. It is 11/27 and Im here for another and to find out I cant return it. Return window closed 10/13. Its been making grinding noises for almost too weeks. I have taken it apart completely to clean it to no avail. No change. Next step is finding a different brand all together. For the money I keep wasting on this fountain, it should last alot longer than 2 months!!!",1
These are the favorite treats in our household. It's the only brand other than the Greenies that all 3 cats like. Like is an understatement - they all go nuts for these treats and would eat the entire bag in a single sitting if they could. I sometimes will put meds into the soft parts of the treat. Sometimes that works.,5
Does just what it says it will do. The dog is more active and happy. More like when he was a puppy.,5
"Overall, I think this a really cute piece for your pet. The material is soft and sure to keep your pup warm. My only problem with it is that it was a bit too big (I have a male dog, and it hung just a little too low, so if he peed it would be on the sweater!) But I just use little safety pins to make it for. Very nice product, but make sure about the sizing for your dog.",4
I have been buying this food for years.  I love the food but hate that they recently reduced the large bag size from 33lbs to 30lbs and increased the price by $5-$10 depending on the retailers.,4
My dog loves them,5
"My dog LOVES this bed! I've only had it for about 6 weeks and it's already getting holes in it, though. I wish the sewing was done for more rugged use seeing as this is for dogs.

Aside from that, it's comfy and my dog loves cuddling up in it.",3
"My puppy absolutely goes nuts for these! She does go through one in about 15-20 minutes and is only 11 weeks old and 17 pounds, so they don't last as long as I was hoping. They keep her busy and happy though so that is a definite plus! Fair warning, the treats get soft when they have been chewed on for a while and get all over her mouth and paws, it is pretty difficult to get off without a bath. Again though, it is definitely worth how much she enjoys them!",5
"My cat absolutely loves playing with his lil' squeeker mouse!
He's an older cat, but this toy seems to be giving him more reasons to be playful.
I highly recommend this !  :-)
Thanx again Amazon",5
Great deal! My local pet store charges $8 a bag for these so this value pack is awesome! I love the natural ingredients and my dogs love the flavor!,5
"I love this shampoo for our dogs. They have hair (don't shed) and they love hiking and being outside (like their owners). They get frequent baths from going in mud and yuck stuff and this shampoo does not dry their skin out at all. It smells really great, too!",5
"Bypass this bulb and go right for the tube version!! The few dollars you save on this bulb isn't worth it. This bulb doesn't give off nearly enough quality UVB for most animals, especially bearded dragons! My bearded dragon went off feed and became severely dehydrated due to lack of UVB exposure while I was using this bulb. I switched to the tube and (after some nursing) he is doing well again.",2
Cute. Too small,3
"This is so handy! I was tired of lugging around old plastic bags ans sometimes forgetting to bring one along. Not anymore! Easy to turn, easy to reload. A must have for a dog owner.",5
Good for the price. Saw significantly change in a month. Work well with the stain but plauqe.,4
dogs love them  last a long time compared to regular milk bones,5
My dog just loves minis chicken breasts.  They have always been so good for him....keep up thegood work.  The treats are small and easy for him to eat as he has bad teeths....,5
"Massive success. A normally picky eater, our male british short hair went straight for the meal.",5
"Very easy to set up and use, remember to hold the button in for 5 seconds for the proper reading. You can set it to give you fairenhight or celcius. The provided suction cup holds it in place nicely. The digital display is easy to read. The display unit in not meant to be placed in the water so be sure not to put into the tank. I have been using it to check my fish tank and it has been working great and has been right on with my water heater temp setting. Im very pleased with the unit. Shipping was quick, packaging was great. Highly recommend product and seller. I would do business with again!

"My two recently adopted guinea pigs love Small Pet Select 2nd cut Timothy Hay.  I gave the pigs a handful of hay for the night and when I woke up, they ate all of it but a few stalks. The hay box that I received was stuffed full of fresh beautiful green hay that smelled great.  This box had plently of seed tops with balance of long soft leaves and stalks.  I like that I can store the hay in the box it came in as well, which is convenient. I had previously purchased Kaytee hay which was nothing but a big bag of dust, so I needed an urgent hay replacement which was delivered within a few days.  Even before the recent Kaytee bag of dust and short pieces hay, which I can't even use for bedding due to the dust, I was looking for a replacement hay because the pigs would only eat the seed tops out of a good bag of Kaytee, which meant that I was having to throw away most of the hay on a daily basis.  Of course, since pigs need 80% of hay in their diet, I was concerned about their lack of interest in hay which I was supplementing with fresh daily grass from a secluded meadow that they loved.",5
Nice pump wish lights had switch for on or off,4
"I have 4 dogs who all need their feet trimmed. These work great, easy to use and I like the fact that they are blunted on the end. Wish there was a way to give Half a star because i would have given 4.5 stars. The only reason for that is that i miss the curl at the end of some scissors.",4
"This dog shampoo is great! My new favorite. The scent is berry, which is delicious. Even though it's a little feminine for my rottweilers I still love it. My favorite part is not even the amazing shine it gives their black coats....It's how well the shampoo suds, bubbles and spreads through their thick coat and undercoat! I will not be buying any other shampoo for my pooches.",5
"My 8 lb puppy was just spayed and this collar was much more comfortable than the usual hard cone for her. In that sense, it seemed like the perfect product. But the fact that it's advertised at a product to use after surgery is a joke, and it's very dangerous. If you don't keep an eye on your dog while they have this on there is a very good chance they'll be able to reach their stitches and chew on them/pull them out. It's common knowledge that the main reason someone would order this is because their dog was just spayed or neutered. My dog didn't even have to be determined, she simply just reached down and started licking her stitches- and the collar fit just fine. I can't speak for anyone but myself, some dogs might be prevented from getting to their stitches but mine definitely was not. Just be very careful and don't put it on them unless you can monitor your pet very closely to see what they can reach.",1
My dog loves these.  One of his favorite presents!,5
"Excellent Product. I've been using Capstar on my Shelties for as long as it's been around. The Sheltie rescue folks as well as the Sheltie club folks here in Atlanta use Capstar and I don't believe I've ever heard of it harming a dog. Just be sure and read the instructions and get the right dosage. Let me reiterate what others have said in the reviews - THIS IS NOT A FLEA PREVENTATIVE! It kills the ADULT fleas already on the dog in short order, but you need to start using a monthly preventative IMMEDIATELY to prevent flea eggs from hatching. It wears off in about a day and you need the preventative to take over when the Capstar loses it's potency as fleas will begin latching onto your dog the very next day. I, personally, have had great luck with it which makes me wonder at all of the 1 star reviews here. Maybe it's the breed of the dog or someone lives in a super-infested area, but I've has none of the problems described by other folks. DEATH TO FLEAS!!!",5
This is my cat's favorite dry food - won't eat any other dry food!!  Has eaten this for over 1-1/2 years (along with some canned food) and still loves it.,5
"It's quiet, small, and works.  The filter cartridge that came with it really was no good -as others have mentioned.  I did buy filter sponge and ceramic balls with intent to replace the filter cartridge as soon as it stopped working.  The 3 gallon tank with one betta got cloudy in two days.  I just threw away the filter cartridge and stuffed it with cut out filter sponge and couple ceramic balls.  The water is getting clearer.  I like this filter a lot.  I know it works well.  I just wish the cartridge worked better and longer than it did.",4
Exactly as expected.,5
"my 55 pound pitbull absolutely love these balls. She destroys every single 20 weed if her, but we've had these for now 6 months and have no problems with him whatsoever. She loves to play with them and their indestructible",5
cheap and easily tears,1
This goes great with vodka.,4
"My beagle loves these bones. We give them to her every sunday as a treat after clipping nails, getting a bath or cleaning her ears. She gets so excited when I pull one out of the bag. She loves them so much that I have signed up for subscribe and save to receive them every month.",5
"My cats are gourmets at lunchtime, I searched all kinds of cat treats without success. I received a sample of this product and I did not pay much attention, after a few days I opened it and gave them to two cats, both loved it. I was surpised. I really like that has no grains and is made from natural products. My cats have food intolerance and egg-splosive was great.",5
"The harness itself is really nice. The material is soft and comfortable and it is easy to put on and remove. Unfortunately, as many others have stated, the sizing is way off. I ordered the XX large for my 62 pound Labradoodle based on the measurements they said to take and it was too big. That being said, I haven't returned it because it does what I need it to do at the moment which is short walks in the yard while she heals from an injury. At some point I may order a smaller size as I do really like the harness in general.",3
Great company. Excellent customer service. Fantastic product. My juvenile severe macaw took to wearing this harness quicker that I ever anticipated. It is such a joy to be able to take my parrot outside and socialize her property and safely. Thank you Parrot University!,5
Great quality and price,5
Seemed to work after just a couple uses. Would have worked better or completely if Id been more diligent so thats my fault,5
"My sister told me about the Vittles Vault, so I decided to give it a try. My dogs are smart, and have figured out how to open other containers. This is extremely sturdy, and the screw on top makes it virtually impossible for critters without hands to get into. It keeps the dog food fresh and will hold a 40 lb bag of food easily. I highly recommend this.",5
great snack for my cats,4
It was what I needed at a very good price.,5
Works great for my 29 gal tank!,5
"Our dogs love this food! When we first got our second dog, she had an upset tummy and we had her on a different brand of food. Once we found out what was wrong with her (worms, she's fine now), we got both dogs on to TOTW dog food, and they both do great on it! They are both mixed breed dogs, one 65 lbs and one 40 lbs. We do rotate around the different TOTW foods, to vary it up for them at times and it does not seem to upset their tummies one bit. I do wish they'd put this on Subscribe and Save.",5
"My dog thinks these taste great, I haven't tried them though.",5
All 3 of my dogs want nothing to do with this thing.,1
"Please correct me if I'm wrong but the ingredients are: Water and natural extracts of lime, pine needle, aniseed, clove and cedarwood.  Yet it claims to be non-toxic, non-hazardous and biodegradable. Safe for humans, pets and the environment. Extracts of lime, pine, clove and some cedarwood can be toxic to cats even if the cat does not come into contact with the containers holding the ""crystals"" (gel bits). Not happy that there is no warning to not use this product around cats or some verification that the harmful components have been removed.",1
This stuff works well. My daughter slacked off one our  55 gallon tank and they got sick. Added this and it helped them recover after I got the tank going good again,5
What can I say? It's a poop bag and its biodegradable.,5
Good dog food for overweight dogs.,4
It works for my dogs very well. I will order more.,5
This fish tank aquarium thermometer is a great item to put on the out side of the aquarium it has a suction cup that sticks on the out side,5
"Safe for clown loaches and cats. Although, I used it as a preventative and at a lower dosage. (30 gallon - 2 packets instead of the suggested 3. No adverse affects)",5
"Follow the instructions, use the enclosed card to check the color of the water and thereby tell the level of copper in the water. Now if someone could just tell me how to get the copper OUT of my hot water lines, I'd be a happy camper!",5
Works great for my allergy prone frenchie.  Smells great too!,5
This shirt is so cute!  The price cannot be beat and it is made really well.  My Bichon is 16 pounds and the fit couldn't be better.  He suffers from allergies and I find tshirts to be a great barrier for scratching.  I would buy this product again!,5
"I absolutely love these things!! I bought the first one at pesmart and realized how much my rabbit liked it, so naturally after getting another rabbit I bought 3 more of them here. I recieved 2 yellow and 1 pink. I use them as a ledge for my rabbits to put their front paws on while they eat so that they don't get choked. They like chewing o. Them as well. Money well spent :)",5
"Our squeaker broke within 24 hours! We have two dogs, a 1 yr old miniature poodle and a 4 month old standard poodle puppy. They have a ton of toys they play with so its not like this was their only toy. Although our standard poodle puppy is larger and teething, she is not destructive with her toys. The squeaker was not punctured but came apart, we can hear the pieces rattling around in the plastic squeaker when we shake the toy. I have also noticed that the fur on the bottom is starting to pull apart. This is just from normal use, carrying the toy around and a couple times our smaller dog has picked up the toy and shaken it around quickly. We have previously had a dog that would deliberately tear toys apart and these dogs don't do that so I was surprised to see the fur falling apart after just a few days. The dogs still enjoy the toy although it doesn't squeak but if the fur keeps coming out easy we will be trashing the toy. It seems well made but I don't think the material is of any sort of quality.",3
"Okay, so, maybe it's that she's half Aussie Cattle Dog and therefore one of the smartest breeds but my dog DID figure this out extremely rapidly, like other reviews are saying. But you know what, I don't mind. She still LOVES this toy and even gets excited when she sees me pick it up (even when I'm just trying to wash it! XD) Could be good for a dog of any size or age because it's easy to learn. If you want to slow down your dogs eating this is a great way to do it, not only will it keep them from scarfing down too quickly but it's FUN for them, too, and makes them use their brain! People know they need to walk their dogs but they don't realize that mental stimulation is essential, as well! Puzzle toys like these are a super easy and fun way to make your dog work to earn their meals which they LOVE, having a sense of purpose. Why not turn feeding time into a game? :)",5
Cute!,4
"A very good product, just wished it lasted longer.",4
No weight to the stand.  Before I could get the bowl atop the stand my dog had knocked it over.  I returned & received a refund.,2
I bought this for our Newfoundland and I could not be more pleased with the purchase. The bowl height is perfect so he doesn't have to bend down really low to eat or drink.,5
"Just got it, they seem to be eating it OK... Time will tell all",5
Good product Thanks,5
Perfect for a small puppy who's learning to walk on a lead. I don't have to pull at his neck so often and he's well behaved on it. Plus I think it gives him a sense of safety and he relaxes while wearing it.,5
"Handy pal, pleasant smell, cats like it.",5
"I would highly recommend Purina Pro Plan Dog food for sensitive skin. I purchased this because my German Shepherd dog has very sensitive skin and will scratch herself raw when fed other dog foods. After starting her on this dog food her scratching decreased significantly. During times of the year in which she is shedding a lot I still do see some scratching, but it is not nearly as bad as it has been in the past. She loves the taste and eats it without difficulty. If you have a dog with itchy skin I would recommend giving this product a try. Additionally, the price on Amazon is great and shipping is very fast. I love being able to order this product and have it sitting on my front porch within a couple of days.",5
"Holds a lot of water which is awesome. The water started flowing not as strong after a week or two.  Do not let this unit run dry at all, I heard strain on it for a moment after.",3
"I travel on a regular basis with my cat on a three-hour drive. I have tried this the last four times and I honestly feel this is doing no good. It has not made her more anxious, nor has it calmed her down. Her cat carrier is made of cloth and roomy, lined with a sherpa base. Each timed I tried spraying the base with a bit more of the product. I wanted/needed this to work, but sadly that is not the case. Wish I could return it - for Mindy it DID NOTHING.",1
Got this for a Boxer and its a cool thing to use a GoPro on. A little shaky but that's how dogs more about.,4
My cats like batting the mouse and laying on it.  It looks like a mouse and feels like a real animal might feel when we accidentally step on it.  The squeak sound is loud enough to be heard,4
The shipping was really fast and it was packaged appropriately. I used it on my yorkie and it lathers up really well. He got so clean and the his coat is noticeable shiny. I love it.,5
"Ok so we are newbies to the Bergan turbo scratcher cat toy world....I read the reviews of the toy and so many people recommended the twinkle replacement balls that I ordered two of them when we ordered the original scratcher.  I use two of the twinkle lights in the scratcher and our two cats love them.  I took the original white ball out and it was lost within a day, but no one misses it.  When these burn out I will purchase two more - so worth the fun it is to watch the cats play with them!",5
"My cats love Weruva. It may appear to be short on the chicken, but that's because the can is not stuffed with grain and a bunch of gunky fatty-lookin' stuff. Thin gravy, shredded white meat chicken, some peas and carrots...NO CARRAGEENAN.
I choose not to feed any fish to my cats, but I can vouch for the chicken and turkey stuff.
Ordered a case last week. Arrived undented and intact.  The expiration on this case is 2019.
Very pleased with the convenience of free delivery. Very pleased with the quality of Weruva cat food and am expecting a case of dog food tomorrow.
For the record: the only dry food I will feed to my dogs and cats now is Acana. After Blue Buffalo lied about ""no by-products"" and Merrick Foods being bought-out by PURINA (eeek!!-oh hell NO!) I feel safe with choices of Acana dry and Weruva canned.",5
I like that it's lightweight and it has pretty good oder control. BUT. My cat tracks dust all over the place after using the litter box.  It's a nightmare to clean up.,2
"I received one as a gift and am considering buying another one. I have been free-feeding the cats using a rotation of puzzle feeders, so that they do not over-eat out of sheer boredom. However, the three puzzle feeders I had before were all plastic. My cats were getting feline acne. I started using this feeder instead and the feline acne has decreased dramatically.",5
So glad I bought this for my bird feeder! It is amazing how much feed it saves!,5
"I got this because I wanted to be ready to take my 3 cats if I had to evacuate for the hurricane. My cats are of average weight and size. It is lightweight, not bulky and easy to assemble- actually it just pops open when you take it out of the packaging. Lucky for me, I did not have to leave so I really haven't put in on a road test, but I let my cats get comfortable playing and lying in it. They didn't have any problem getting into it. However, I have not tried to put all three in it yet, so that will be an adventure.
But if you want something light and easy to carry, especially if you are in a hurry, this is for you.",5
"My old dog is no longer the notorious fart machine he once was. He is still a fart machine, but just not as often and not nearly as potent.",5
They didn't sink and went right to the filter skimmer.,2
"does as expected, remember to adjust as dog grows.",4
"The Comfy Cone sounded like the perfect way to protect my dog's stitches while letting her feel less like she was wearing a ""cone of shame.""  However, my Border Collie pup learned how to fold back the edge of the cone and removed all but two of her stitches from her spay surgery.  Had the location of the surgery been less accessible, it may have worked, but I ended up buying a plastic cone and antibiotics due to an infected incision.  I wish I could, but I cannot recommend this product.",2
wish I'd bought this for my dog sooner,5
My dog absolutely loves this thing. It's great for playing and getting energy out when the weather sucks and we don't get outside.,5
Just bought and delivered on the 16th of August and it has come undone at the seams dog ate some of the stuffing because of this so threw it away,1
"I really love this pouch, but after using it a few times the clip for the belt / strap broke off so now I have to figure out a way to attach it to another belt since this doesn't have a standard belt loop. Hopefully I can get a replacement from the company.",2
"Pups love it.
Much easier than going to the pet shops.
Deliverer right to my door.",5
Adorable!,5
My chocolate lab is an avid chewer and she loves this toy. It is made out of a thicker corduroy type fabric with thick sticking. The limbs have squeekers in them for her to annoy the heck out of me with. So far she hadn't destroyed it. Washes easy in the machine.,4
"My 2 year old Pit bull loves to use her jaw. Like for everything. And the nylabone is her go to favorite item. It helps her relax and she will chew for a long time.  I love that it doesn't smell or get gross like a bully stick. When given the choice between the two she will always choose her Nylabone! Love your product! The wishbone shape is great for her to hold and chew at the same time
We get about two to three months out of them but I have several around my house",5
"My cats love it. When I pull it out to fill their bowl, they come running. Although  there is only 2 of them, they make pigs of themselves, and I need to push them away just to fill their bowl.",5
My picky pup loves this.,4
work great as prescribed.,5
"I wasn't expecting much when I purchased this. I was pleasantly surprised that it has 4 settings ...regular, led, blue (black light), and off. I am using it for my single goldfish in a 10 gallon tank. He and I both Love it! I do have a tank with a lipped edge so I have to be careful not to bump it too hard since it dosnt slide all the way down but I secured it a different way and it works fine.",5
"My dog is obsessed with the mini version of the chuck it balls. I do have to say, if given the choice between these or the mini chuckit balls that are just made of the rubber, I prefer the rubber, because they last longer, especially since she has a tendency to leave them outside in the weather and the fuzz can be eventually chewed off.",4
This litter has a different texture and appearance than what my cat is used to using. I seriously doubt we'll be buying it again.,4
"These are pricy, but SO much better for our pup than raw hide and Amazon has a MUCH better price than our local pet store.  Our dog goes BONKERS for these!  He only gets about 1 a week.  Our 70lb lab/pit mix is a heavy chewer.  Upon receipt of his bully he prances around the house and yard with it for about 5 minutes, showing it off to anyone who will pay attention to him, tosses it in the air and attacks it for a few minutes, then once he starts to chew it, it takes him about 7 mins to devour it.  We've purchase bully sticks that were not odor-free and they gave me the dry heaves, they stunk so bad.  I will only buy odor-free going forward.  We just ordered more of these from this same manufacturer (USA!) during an Amazon lightening sale, 10 12"" sticks that we will cut IN 1/2 to 6"", $30/12 = $2.50 per stick is a steal!  These will last us a few months.",5
Very good food!,4
"Soft, lightweight. Just what I needed for a 5 pound chihuahua. Looks well made and durable.",5
"A size medium fit my oversized Chihuahua perfectly. I read the reviews about how the sizes run small and that was absolutely correct, so glad I listened. The quality is great and its so adorable.",5
Great Product!,5
"I wish I could say that my dog loved it, sadly I cannot. I have a very finicky shih tzu/bichon mix who would not touch this stuff. I'm not sure if Acana makes speciality food for small breeds, my dog may have done better with that.",3
"My dog's senses become very keen whenever he sees this bag, hears me opening it, and/or catches a whiff once it's opened.  His attention becomes laser-focused upon this bag and its contents.  Needless to say, our pup loves these treats.  Oh, and my wife told me the other day she had to stop herself reaching for them because they looked so good before remembering they were dog treats (the label was facing the other way).  I've thought the same thing.  They do look very appetizing and smell good too.  So far I've been able to resist.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for my wife (she ate dog food as a child).",5
Best leash ever.. I have a 4 years old Siberian husky service dog and she has one bad habit of wanting to pull me up the stairs which after today will never be a issue,5
This nylabone ring is too hard.  My dog broke a small piece of tooth while trying to chew on this ring.  I do not recommend it.,1
"Good if your dog doesn't use this as a chew toy. Give it to a 6 mths golden, ears were ripped and belly torn",4
"This product helped more than most of the ointments I've been given over the years for my cats chronic eye issue. It cleared up faster and much better with this. I wanted something natural, as I read using the antibiotic ointments too much can lead to other problems. I will be buying this again!",4
"strong, good quality, vibrant color, strong clasp",5
"Great fish oil, my dogs coats are soft",5
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this cat harness, I am going to order the next size up for when my kitten grows out of this one. It comes with a leash and rhinestone crown charm. The only negative is that the flowers are got glued on, I chose to tack them down with a few stitches. Our kitten Pippa doesn't mind wearing it at all. Cutest harness on the market for people who love frilly stuff for their pets.",5
"I have two rescue cats. I feed them grain free and some raw. One of our kitties is very picky - and both she and our other cat loved this food.

They tried the Oh My Cod flavor.  The ingredients seem really good and they like it - recommended.",5
Is what it is.,4
This stuff works ok but it is SO EXPENSIVE to keep up. Go to the vet and get kitty prozac for $25 a month and save your furniture and your sanity!,2
This is like kitty crack. My two Russian Blues go nuts for these things. Previously the only treat I gave them was Stewart's Fiber Formula. My Blues are taking a break from Stewart's and enjoying some Kittles.,4
my dogs don't like this treat at all.,2
"Works well on our dogs. We have labradoodles and it smells great, and manages well on their fur. Will be ordering more in the future.",5
"Not as rugged as I would like, but will work.",4
"it was a little smaller than i expected but i suppose that was my fault for not reading the specs.

I put this in my African Grey's cage and he ended up destroying it within a week (it generally takes him longer to destroy his toys).  I guess i was expecting this to be more like a perch than a chew toy

I don't think I would buy this again, but I suppose that's mostly because I was looking for a longer lasting toy.  if you want something for your bird to chew on, this would be good.",3
"This food is definitely a step above grocery store brands but my dog could not tolerate the grain and had loose stools for 2 months which she also had on royal canin, switched to Orijen puppy food and all Is well",3
"I started using this as recommended by a friend. I adopted a dog from a shelter and was feeding him purina dog chow and he had really bad gas all the time. My friend said its cause purina is ""crappy food"" and i should try something with better ingredients like Taste of the Wild. Problem went away! It is a little pricey but I always find it cheaper on Amazon and being able to get it shipped free is awesome!!! even if it takes 7 days i don't mind, i just order after half a bag is gone",4
Plush. Looks nice in our great room and not sloppy.,5
"The cats love these, and they're the perfect size for bunny-kicking, pouncing, chewing, even batting!  Filled with nice, potent catnip covered by canvas so it'll last a long time.  If you have a kitty who likes to bunny-kick their toys, this is the toy for you (well, your cat)!  I got several so my kitties wouldn't have to fight over them ;)",5
"I was not impressed with this item. I am not sure if there is more to it than what I did. I simply gave it to my pups as it came in the package. It took them a record of 3 minutes to pop the treat out and had the treat devoured within 5 minutes. However, they love playing with the ball even without the treat. It seems to withstand a lot of chewing as well!",3
"I had the same problem that others had with Frontline.  A couple of years ago, it quit working.  I had fleas everywhere.  I spent hours a night with the flea comb on the animals - it was a horror show.  I found this product and within 24 hours the animals were better, and after about 3-4 days - no more fleas showed up anywhere.  I haven't had a flea problem since.  This is a great product.

Today the ticks came out.  I found out that I didn't have any more of this.  I told the dog I'd get the ""bug medicine"" and she was asking me for it at that point.  I only had a couple of drops left in the tubes.  I'm back to order more now.  Great stuff.",5
My little Yorkie loves this food.,5
"This stuff is amazing! Currently using in a Fluval Spec III.  A 100ml pouch will fit (folded in half) in the top cut out where the carbon is supposed to go.  Prior to Purigen my water was tea yellow from mopani wood tannins even though I boiled the wood for hours and soaked it for 2 weeks.  Inserted Purigen - a few hours later my water was crystal clear.  The tank is planted and home to 1 betta and 2 amano shrimp.  Everything is healthy with no adverse affects.

I like that you can regenerate it, but note that Purigen can become toxic during regeneration if it was previously exposed to Slime Coat conditioners containing amine.  ""Only certain slime coat products will cause Purigen to become toxic; the products that do this are amine based. Seachem Prime and Safe are not amine based and will not cause this problem. If you're curious, what happens is that the amine compounds can strongly bind to the resin, then when they (the amines) come into contact with any chlorine they will form chloramines which are highly toxic.""

However, if you don't plan on reusing the Purigen you can continue to use amine based conditioners.",5
Great quality light fixture with excellent customer service from Finnex. This was the 3rd light I've bought from them over the years.,5
"I bought 18 of these because my dog is obsessed with them but loses them while we are walking.  I hate the squeaker and love when it is broken, but he, of course, prefers the ones that still make noises.  I am almost down to the last one and will have to reorder soon.  Perfect size for chasing.  Fits into most throwing gadgets.",5
great for long distance trips. My puppy slept in it comfortably. Well made. Took my puppy in it to vet's office and received many compliments!,5
Even though it says it is a firm slicker brush it does not brush matts out well. In fact it glides right over the knots and leaves them in there. Miracle Coat slicker brushes are far better.,2
I have a 70 lb lab mix and wanted a harness for him.  I wasn't sure what size to order and I think the XXL was a perfect fit.  It still has plenty of room if he gets bigger.  It appears well made and secure.,5
Cute tennis balls! And they squeak so my dog loves that.,5
"Makes my dogs smell great, not sure if it helps that much with the shedding but they are noticeably softer after using this conditioner.",5
A great treat,5
"I purchased the green medium, in accordance with the sizing chart provided by happy Dog Place (he has a 13"" neck and 17"" ribcage). The charming harness came in, but it was big enough to let my little guy slip out of. I contacted the company for an exchange, explaining that if their sizing chart hadn't misdirected me, I would have ordered the small. The company said they'd gladly ship out an exchange if we paid $2.50 shipping for the item. (Why does it originally cost $6.00 to ship me a harness if the exchange only costs $2.50?) So, besides S&H rip off and poor sizing (order a full size smaller than what the chart says) I'd say this is an excellent purchase. Gotta lower them two stars for the above mentioned woes.",3
My Pomeranian loves it and its the perfect size for him at 20lbs,5
"I bought this airline tubing for my 29 gallon tank ...
One word is excellent tubing - Make sure u get check value also.",5
perfect replacements,5
Geckos love to climb on it.,5
Kitty seems to like it.,5
"This dog food is one of the only foods I've found that seems to really agree with my dog's rather delicate digestive system. No more funky gas problems anymore thanks to this food, and it's cheaper to have it delivered to me than to pick it up at my local big box retailer. A win all around!",5
"Leaves your dog with a bit of a greasy fell. Does help to get out tangles, but not really useful for matting.",3
"Fur baby loves them, breath smells better and they don't aggravate her allergies!",5
This cooling pad has worked so well for my dog.  We don't have AC or a swamp cooler in our house and it can get really toasty in our room during the summer.  This mat has made it much more comfortable for him this summer.  I can tell he loves it because he chooses to lie on the cooling pad instead of his comfy bed at night.,5
"My dog loves these treats, but I did notice that he right away was able to pop one of them out of the holder and had swallowed it whole. He is a shi-tzu mix so it was very concerning to me that he could have possibly choked on it. Since then I only allow him to have this when we are watching him. Additionally, he hasn't popped another out like that since, but it is good to know that it can and does happen.",3
"This food was on a list of low-sodium, high quality  canine foods from our cardiac vet. Its the only one my dog (a Boxer but this is good for any large breed who needs low-sodium and high taurine) enjoys plain. The kibble are large and a funky shape that makes them easy to pick up from the bowl. Watch the recommendation for serving size- my dog gained weight quickly on the recommended serving- my 75lb Boxer gets just a little more than 2 cups total per day. Second dog eats a grain free diet but much prefers this food too.",5
My dog has stomach problems and pancreatitis and she loves this food. Hasn't thrown up since,5
Great,5
Keeps my kitties teeth clean,5
"yes, yes, YES! This thing is a lifesaver.. or at the very least an arm saver. I started using it on my year old Scottish Terrier/Poodle a little over a year ago (he is 2 now). It was a struggle the first day, he kept pawing at his nose, but i just kept walking and he got used to it pretty quickly. Walks are no longer a squirrel hunt. with this lead i can control where his head goes, and he doesn't pull or he would just end up turning himself around. This is the third leader i've gotten (bad habit of leaving them behind on holidays) and is by far my favorite one. It is easier to put on than the ones i found at PetSmart. It has only one clip and works just as well! When i don't have it with me hes still much better on a lead than he used to be, a couple tugs and he falls back at my side, before the entire 45 minutes was a battle.

My dog went from getting wound up trying to chase furry critters on walks to coming home relaxed and wound down. I can tell he gets more out of the walk this way and i know i do.",5
"I use it for my 14 year old and 10 year old dogs. They like them but the they are small so the blind 14 year old you have to put it at his nose.
I would have used them to train but you cannot teach old dogs new tricks!",4
"My 80lb+ dogs get a  tablespoon of plain, low/fat free yogurt daily in their dinners...and, as a result, DO NOT FART!!!!
I don't think there's either enough yogurt in these to have the same result...and store yogurt is sure less costly!
But they sure did like chewing your treats!",3
The fit good and work ok but They get dirty fast but are expensive,4
"Item is good quality but the sizing is a little off. I measured my dog and she seemed to exactly fit the small, but it is a little big. We're going to wash and dry it and hope it fits better. If not I might just take the seams in a little bit.",4
Good value.,5
"Absolutely love this liner! I have a dog that loves to roll in mud and dead animals and poop and all sorts of other things. This liner has saved my car from being disgusting like my dog. I used it in my 2010 Ford Escape and it is just slightly too long. The first day I had it I accidentally made a hole in it by closing the tailgate on it, and the latch punctured it. Now I just keep that edge folded. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep the back of their car clean! It's also easily removed to put the seats up on the rare occasion I have passengers who aren't my dog.",5
fine,5
Good brush that gets the job done.,5
bought this for best protection for my large 120# dog.  Best price and best reviews. Don't want my dog falling on floor in car from sudden stops,5
"Did nothing for our spastic rat terrier.  Then again, nothing else worked either.",1
"Like others, I also have to hide in his food, he won't touch them otherwise.. too soon to see any change, so I'll have to update. Hopeful it eases his joint pain some.. worth trying..",4
"My dog has food allergies and these are great for her--no tummy upset or itching. Very nice size for small dogs.  I got it at the add on price, which was very affordable. Highly recommend.",5
nice shirt / runs large,5
"I really like these, easy cleanup the no slip base works great.",5
My dog doesn't like them. But maybe that's just him. He won't touch them. They do seem to have an odd texture.,3
Very cute and perfect for my Yorkies,4
"I wholeheartedly recommend this line of treats for your dogs. My dogs definitely know what the word ""greenie"" means, and will start running around like lunatics at the promise of receiving one. These originals are all about fresh breath and clean teeth, and my veterinarian can attest to the fact that they do indeed work on my dogs' teeth. I am able to forgo the under anesthesia dental cleaning for a while, because I have a very strict dental routine for my dogs(that does not involve brushing, btw), and these treats are a part of their daily routine. I feel like a good pet owner when I feed these to my dogs.",5
I previously had my dog on the regular blue toy breed. While she did eat that and enjoy it. She's a dog that would typically eat her dry kibble only when she's really hungry preferring to eat treats all day or beg for human food. After switching to the wilderness she actually begs for more food to be put into her bowl!,5
These were easy to use.  This is the first time I clipped my dog's nails and I found it to be a simple process.  The guard on the clippers was helpful and I did not feel like I was going to hurt my dog.,5
Nice leash.  Great pattern.  Strong for active puppy!,5
"ALWAYS FAST ship! GREAT product ,my cat CANNOT be ""regular"" without it!",5
This held up with a large border collie pulling part of it inside and chewing on it. Can't even tell that happened! I foster dogs so it's great to have things hold up!,5
"my little Border collie is about to turn 15 in December, and she's getting to be a real fuss pot about where she sleeps (since she's not able to jump up on the couch anymore). This warming pad was a lightning deal, so I got it for her - kind of on impulse, really. And she LOVES it! I no longer have to wonder where she is in the house - she's curled up on the pad! I couldn't be more thrilled... she worked hard for me every day until she retired, and I'm glad I can make her retirement more comfy. Love this warming pad... great for my old girl. I do not know if the cats would like it too, as she never gives them a chance to try it.",5
"I don't know how accurate these are, but they seem to work find, are easy to read and inexpensive.",4
My cats love this bush and it is so easy to clean off all that fur with a single press. I was hesitant cause I didn't think my cats would like something so wire-y but they love it! Purrrrs all around :),5
The long feather hangs down so far that my cat doesn't want to play with it.  I haven't yet tried the smaller feather.,2
"The best price! I used to buy at Walmart, not any more. My mini dachshund boy loves it. This can contents 3 meals for my 13 lb. He eats twice/day. THANK YOU AMAZON ! Woof - woof :)",5
"Great smell, and not dusty. The cats seem to like it (don't toss it out of the litter box as they do with some brands). The box is easy to use which is  a big bonus. Works like a charm.",5
"This works wonders on my dog's teeth.
I have an older dog (almost 13), with lots of tartar build-up on his teeth. While I brush his teeth 3-4 times a week, the tartar still builds up. After using this product for 30 days, the tartar and stains began to disappear, and now his teeth look much healthier! I believe his breath smells better as well.
Great stuff!",5
"The chunks of freeze dried pheasant was non existent, in its place was dust in the bottom of the bag. My dog did eat it & seemed to enjoy it but I'm sure he would have enjoyed it more if he'd had the chance to chew on some pieces of pheasant, rather than licking dust.",2
Even my chew crazy dog can't get through this bear.,5
our dogs love one a day.  good for their teeth,5
"Sturdy and works for purpose. Wood is sharp at edges and you can get splinters. This would have been much nicer if it wasn't so ""raw"" and unfinished, but it is sturdy and looks okay in the playroom.",3
"i have a cat who has major food allergy problems. this is the only food that doesn't give him a reaction besides the prescription food i had him on originally, which contains almost exactly the same ingredients. that food was $58 for an 8.8 pound bag. this is about $15 for a 5 lb bag and $25ish for a 10 lb bag. do the math. MUCH BETTER",5
This product is fantastic because it's safe and natural for my cat and I used it on me when doing yard work after being stung by mosquitos and I said what the heck and it worked!  Smells great also.,5
"Ugh, the cats love this thing.  After one minute of playing though, the string becomes twisted on the rod.  If you keep playing because  you've grown tired of untwisting it every minute, it twists in on it self in a grotesque manner.  If you hate twisted cords and strings do not buy this toy.",2
Verdict is still out on lavendar verses blue. At first they didn't seem to care for but now they use lavendar also. Honestly I can't tell much difference between the two.,3
"I bought this to help my kitten from teething. She played with it for a bit, but the dog ended up using it more and now neither of them really touch it. It was a good price though and I'm just glad one of them had fun with it.",3
"My puppy enjoys the taste. I especially enjoy the fact that I can feed one to her a day and treat it as if it's a snack. She chomps on it immediately. I love the fact that I don't have to hide it in her food.

I pair this up with Canidae All Life Stages, Oster Naturals Oatmeal Shampoo and Grizzly Pollock Oil... her fur is soft, shiny and her shedding is minimal. :)",5
"Love the fabric, love the fit, true to size, n well made- thank you !",5
First time I use RSM salt.  Calcium looks like little high.,4
This is a great piece. Love how it looks ....very pretty and interesting to watch. Low maintenance. My only criticism is that it is expensive. Great gift for someone that has everything.,5
"This is a great product. They include a packet of catnip in case your cats need some encouragement to check it out. My kitties have only ever had cardboard scratching toys to use so they know just what to do. I had not had these out of the box for a full minute before my babies were on it. The love it. They love the cat nip too! We stick a few toys or treats in the holes in the sides and they enjoy batting them out too. The shape seems to be more appealing then the flat ones they have. They get a really good stretch when they use this one. I couldn't get a picture of them on it but you can tell from this picture I do include that it has already gotten a lot of love.

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",5
SO CUTE,5
"Best part of these is that this is the first time replacing it since the original purchase 4 years ago, and I have 4 big dogs!",5
"Absolute junk, do not buy, doesnt work at all, waste of money.",1
Washes clean. I use bleach and soap and washes without losing color. Cats liked it a lot. Top stays put. Nice pink and tan coloring.,5
"I like this box a lot, kitties seem OK with it too.  I have a litter pan on the landing of my stairs, and it was hard to get around it sometimes.  That was a regular rectangular box, now that I have this, it fits nicely in the corner of the landing, easy to walk by, and kitties don't try to scratch so much at the wall, due to the nice high sides.  This IS a large pan, if you are in doubt, check the measurements before ordering.  But I have multiple cats and this works for us.  I have regular litter pans in other areas, but when you have room in a corner, this is the answer.  Sturdy, well made.  Easy to scoop.",5
"I liked the apple better, but these are great too! and my dog loves them",5
Love the ones I bought for my 2 rabbits..Well made & sturdy..,5
"Good stuff here, I just wish someone would make a cling background that is 48"" long or longer so I don't have to splice two of them together to cover my aquarium.",5
"At first I thought this duck toy would hold through for my 14 week lab puppy but unfortunately after two days of using this, the neck broke through from the threads and the squeaky came out. Luckily I noticed this before putting this duck toy in the cage otherwise it would of been a potential hazard for my dog (ex. Swallowing). The description made it seem like the toy would be strong hold for puppies due to the double stitching but guess it is not reliable enough to survive through a playful puppy.",1
"This harness just WORKS, when nothing else would. Below is my experience with my dog.

My female Labrador retriever, Whiskey Bean, is relatively small by the standards of her breed. She only weighs 55 pounds, but she's very strong and energetic. I taught her how to walk on a leash when she was a puppy, and she immediately picked it up, heeling very well. Her weakness, however, was when she would see other people or dogs when we were walking. She would immediately lung toward the people or dogs, because she wanted to say hello and play. She's extremely friendly, and she's never snapped at anybody; she just loves everybody, and would want to play. All training would leave her mind, and she would pull against her leash, full steam ahead. She would ignore commands, and if I used a training collar, she would gladly pull against it. Other harnesses would not work... they would slow her down a little bit, but she would still be able to pull against it as hard as she liked.

This harness, however, put a stop to that. Like many great ideas, its innovation seems simple in hindsight. All they did was put the buckle on the FRONT of the harness, rather than at the back. Therefore, your leash connects at the front of the dog's chest (as you can see in the photo of the product). So when Whiskey Bean begins pulling really hard, the design of the harness simply TURNS HER AROUND. She can't pull if she's facing the wrong way!

Not only this, but since I've been walking her with this harness for about a month now, I've found that she generally won't try to pull against the harness, even when there are other dogs around. Once in a while she will, if she's really excited (like in a busy downtown setting), but her behavior is drastically improved. Also, her heeling continues to be just as good as it was with traditional collars. The placement of the buckle on the harness allows me to gently tug in order to slow/speed her pace to bring her back to a good heel.

Sizes for this harness run on the large side. I bought a medium (thought she would have been a large) size for Whiskey Bean (55 pounds), and it fits perfectly. It's also worth mentioning that the design of this harness is very well thought out, in terms of putting it on and removing it- it's much easier than than the other harness I tried, and it only takes a couple of seconds. This was a great purchase, and a must buy for anybody who walks a dog. If you don't regularly walk your dog because of his or her pulling behavior- this harness just might transform you into a person who loves to walk with their dog!",5
"I really like this mat!!!  First, it's actually bigger than I thought which was fine with me.  Secondly, it really does keep the litter from tracking all over the place and it's easy to sweep off the litter that is on the mat.  Very happy with this purchase!!!",5
"After much research, I settled on these. My dog loves them, and they're good for him. What could be better.",5
"this thing is great, it has a bit of a learning curve with how to throw it but you learn quickly. i use this with my dog at the dog park",5
"My dog loves these rawhides the best out of all that I've purchased for her. They also indicate that these treats have protein, which is nice to know when you're giving your dog a treat.",5
the chats love the toy so I had bought 4 because we have three cats and they go pretty fast if 3 cats use it all the time was very fast shipping thank you!,5
This is a great life jacket! It was very sturdy on my dog and provided me a lot of security with him swimming in the lake. I worried he might wear out with all the swmiming and I wanted him protected. It helped keep him afloat and I like the handle to pull him back up into the boat. It's very well build and feels very safe and secure on the dog. I am very happy with my purchase.  I have a 65lb lab and I ordered a Large. It fits perfectly.,5
II saw one flea on one of my pets and flipped out. I knew I had to hit my home hard. I should have read the back of the bottom more. I will say that it is very strong. The scent takes awhile to go away and will aggravate your eyes. It gave me a headache and I realized quickly that the animals would need to stay out of the room for quite awhile. I can say that I haven't seen any fleas so far in there so I can't complain,3
Can't get cats to use it,3
Our ferret absolutely turned his nose up at this supplement & refused to try it. Normally he's very curious about new smells & offerings. He absolutely loves Vitapaste so we will stick w/that.,1
This collar works wonders on my very barky dogs! They become silent immediately when I put it on them! But having 2 dogs and 1 collar is difficult...so I'm going to order another one!,5
My cats LOVE them!,5
Makes puppy teeth smeel great and the taste didn't seem to bother my 8 week old pup!,5
My turtle likes these.  They are great for those days we don't get to feed him or he is extra hungry.,5
Great look and size for small pups. This puppy will grow to be a medium sized dog.,5
Great bags.,5
My two nearly 100 lb dogs adore this thing.  I just ordered a 2nd one even tho they both fit easily on the XL.  Popped right out of the box ready to use.  I don't think they'll be getting up any time soon.  Very happy w it.,5
Our little dog gets one of these each day and loves them!,5
"The harness is very attractive, easy to put on my dog, and is well made. However, the material could be a little more flexible or have more cushioning on it. Very sturdy.",4
"Good, quality dog foods are easier to find than in the past, thanks to the committed effort from a growing base of manufacturers that want to make better foods for our canine friends. Science Diet is one of the companies that has been around for a little longer than its competition and it continues to make quality foods like Perfect Weight Dry Dog Food.

The most important quality of any dog food is the way its made and this Hills Science Diet dog food is good in most respects. There are no artificial colors or preservatives in this dog food and it contains chicken, vegetables, and other good ingredients. And as long as you feed in moderation, it can help your dog stay in good shape. Its greatest strike in the ingredient department is the added grains, but there are not as many grains in this food as in some of the cheaper foods so I think I can overlook this.

So, did my dog take to Hills Science Diet Perfect Weight Dog Food? Well, yes, he in fact does seem to like it. The kibbles are a little larger than he prefers, but he can still eat the food without much of a problem. He was lukewarm at first, but he is like this with any new dog food. After a while, he emptied out his bowl and now he looks forward to his next meal.

This dog food is a little on the costly side and that could be enough to discourage many dog owners from buying. But if you can get past the price, you will find that this is a very good dog food with respectable quality. It isn't perfect, like the name suggests, but it is certainly an above average pet food product that all dog owners should try, particularly if your dog needs a little help in the weight department.",4
"My dogs are chewers, but they are also relatively small (30 -35 lb range).  These toys last a long time at my house.  I throw them in the washing machine and air-dry them with no problem.  There's no stuffing for any dog to eat, which is important.",5
Great seller and product,5
"Barely saw a change in my electric bill after keeping this plugged in 24/7. My outdoor kitty took a couple months and a lot of treats to learn not to be afraid of the pad, but now loves it to keep warm.",5
Great quality,5
Just the size I needed..very easy on the hands! Dog responded very well! Would recommend highly! Great color!  Use for shelter dogs!,5
"Unfortunately, my dog spits them out immediately.  He ate the ones I purchased from Entirely Pets so not sure what's wrong with these.  They can't work if he won't eat them.  Guess I'll give them to my local humane society for their senior dogs.",1
Not very durable,2
they seem to be working just as well as their alternative but it is too soon to tell if they last as long/,4
Very colorful and makes noise. Dog chewed through it within days.,1
Dogs love it and subscription saves us a lot of money.,5
Very convenient!,5
"This was not a winner in our quest for discouraging our dog who chews and licks herself obsessively. We went straight back to the non-alternative E collar. Dogs can still get to various parts that are chew-worthy, the fabric is stretchy enough that they can nose up under the edges, it isn't at all chew-proof material itself, and it's made in a really unfinished, home project kind of way - raw cut edges, for example. The fabric is really thin stretchy knit - it would cost you pennies to cut a thrift shop kid's tee shirt into one of these. Taking it on and off for elimination needs is a pain, and the way it fastens is by stuffing the cut tails of the shirt, which get wrapped under the dogs back legs, into a kind of annoying Velcro pouch. I do origami pretty competently and I can't make that into a very elegant solution. I'm giving more than a single star rating only because, if you're considering it as a thundershirt alternative it might work for you, or if your dog is very easily discouraged from chewing, or if you only need it for a couple of post-op days. Maybe.",2
"Great kennel! fits my 10 lbs kitty kat Niko perfectly, with extra space to move. set up was easy (took 3 mins) and its very sturdy!",5
"My Sheltie loves this ball.  She attacks it, herds it, drags it around and yes, barks at it!  (she's a Sheltie)  Great purchase!!!",5
"I'm sorry, the smell of the product is so awful, I have to throw it away and get something else.",1
My rats don't enjoy this tons but they play with it a little,3
"This food is amazing! I noticed a huge difference in my cats eye boogies lol.. they're almost non-existent! Also, their coat is shiny, soft and just gorgeous. So goes for my 2 dogs with Caniade dog food! Definitely worth the price!",5
"Perfect, smells great , very strong and fun looking !",5
great cat food my older one eat it better not throwing it up gentle on tummys thx deb love the taste too,5
This product is NOT made in the USA.,1
My saga and cats love the food.,5
"Cats love it, easy to store and pour. Been buying same for a year+. Always arrives quickly.",5
I love love love this pet gate!  It is super easy to assemble and disassemble and the quality is very nice.  My only recommendation would be to purchased a strong magnet to help you pull the pins out when you need to disassemble.  I highly recommend this gate!,5
"Good price, good quality.",5
"I don't know what it is about this toy, but normally my dog shreds anything she gets.  This one, she carries around, squeaks it, plays with it, and sleeps with it.  The only time I replace it is when the squeaker breaks.  We also have the skunk and she is just as gentle with it.",5

The back ones fit perfectly, and I think she needs the next size up for her front paws which eventually came off over the course of 30 min of running over grass, hills, and rocks.
The rubber balloon booties work well for quick walks and are faster to put on, but when were playing fetch, they get torn to shreds.  These are durable and the rubber bottoms give her a pretty good grip while running (see video)",5
These are my dogs favorite. She is a 6 pound Chihuahua and these are the perfect size for her. She loves them. They last a long time because there are so many.,5
"Bought this awhile ago. My dog still uses it although not as much. I like it and it was a good buy, taking off 1 star just because the bolts come loose all the time. They never fell out on me but every time I move this thing I have to tighten the bolts.",4
key for maintaining your aquarium plants.,4
small but it workes,3
"Installed this in my filter last week, and only noticed a little change. I know that this will help in the long run, however not sure about this cleaning cloudy water.",3
Cat did not like this at all. He takes the vetri lysine and loves it but this he would not eat. Would not order again if cats won't eat it.,1
"I have two cats; 1 senior and 1 kitten that both love to play. They enjoy sitting in the curve of the new toy, scratching on the carpetted section and batting at the toy. Only marked it down because that lovely tunnel I expected them to go through is too small. They can't fit under it.",4
No stink. But they don't last at all. My giant ate them far too fast. Bull sticks from Costco last much longer.,5
"First, I must say I only give rawhide when I can supervise the dogs, just to make sure no one chokes. That being said, these are a huge treat for my 4 small dogs. They love them. Dingo is the only brand of rawhide I buy now. Even for the larger bones for my  Border Collie, I buy Dingo. Rare that I find a treat they all enjoy, and my dogs can be such snobs.",5
So far so good.  Dog seems comfortable in it.,5
I'll post more after I try it on my dog and if it does or does not work!,3
Picky puppy loves these!!!,5
"Best ball I've had for my German Shepherd. I kick it around, he retrieves it and chews on it and we can still play because he can't pop it. The bright neon color is also very helpful.",5
Great marbles; look great in my fish tank.,5
"Great for clipping on to my purse and going. Nice and compact, but fits plent of treats for a day out. Drawstring keeps treats in pouch.",5
"This tough dog toy is a little big even for my 100-pound dog, but she LOVES it!

It's very wide, but thin, so she has to pick it up a certain way- which seems awkward, but she seems to love the challenge. She is still prancing around with it after working it out of the Amazon box. It is very sturdy and the fur is softer than on other tough toys. The seams are extra strong.

This is is definitely for big dogs.",4
I didn't see much result unless I actually brush my dog's tiny teeth.  It should be into a toothpaste as most dogs hate the shocking forceful spray into their mouths.,3
"MY DOG HAS LOVED THIS TIE-OUT FOR BEING OUT IN THE YARD. HE CHEWED THE ROPE TIE-OUT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO  NOW I WON""T HAVE TO CHASE HIM AROUND THE BLOCK. HAPPY ME.",4
as expected,4
I'm new to the cat game but everything about this makes sense. Worth the extra money for the convienece.,5
My dog loves these treats.,5
"Using this along with spray on plaque remover to hopefully avoid another costly dental for my small senior dog. It's pretty tricky business, but I think this tool is going to help. There are no burrs on the edges and it's well-balanced for holding. I can't complain.",5
Very good and a good price.,5
Goldie loves these salmon treats!,5
"Better smelling than the original bully stick, but still has an unpleasant odor.",3
"I've used this for my dog several times, and it definitely seems to help. She is a very anxious dog during travel, and this has helped her stay more collected on all of our vacations.",5
"Many years ago I started using washable puppy pads for my shorkie. The first brand I bought were great, but then they changed and are now terrible. I found LennyPads and thought I had found a good replacement. I was wrong. The fact that these are white is just gross. You can see the urine, so they should make them another color. And they leaked. The first time my dog used it, I went to see if it leaked, and sure enough it went right through the bottom. I have learned that if I don't want puppy pee on the floor, I double up on puppy pads. I have plenty now after trying so many different brands, and apparently that is the only option any more.",2
pups love it,5
works as advertised,4
"So cute, but made small.  I bought a Med. for our Toy Poodle, and had to send it back.
It's made well, and seems like it would be warm, but my advice is to order the next size
up..",4
The felt cleaner is hollow so it holds lots of water and always makes a mess outside the tank after cleaning.,4
Yummy for my dog,5
Didn't see any differents in my dogs fur.,3
"Wow, all my cats love this, to play in sleep in, hang out in, etc.",5
Very cool,5
These bowls work very well. My pup likes them she picks it up and moves it to where she wants it.,4
Sadly my dog didn't like it and refuses to keep it on in the car.  So she doesn't get to put her head out the window,5
Dog love these small toys... perfect for Chihuahua's.,5
"Very convenient to buy these bags online. They are actually less expensive ,than using gas,time etc to drive the 15 miles ,to Petco.",5
It was a sturdy material. They slipped off my dogs paws and twisted around her paw. I had to constantly readjust them. The Velcro also started to unthread from the boot. Not durable.,2
"This is an excellent timothy hay! It is nice and green, has lots of seed heads and leafy bits. This hay smells wonderful too. I am going to try the Orchard grass hay next. I feed my guinea pigs a combination of timothy and orchard grass hay and have tried every brand out there. This brand is the closest to the kleenmama's brand that I have seen. Much better than small pet select, jojo's and oxbow in my opinion. Highly recommend! Can't wait to try the Orchard!",5
"I have a 100 lb dog having trouble using steps into my SUV.  She will not use this ramp, and I think it is just too narrow for her.",3
Great for what we use it for.,4
This is a great little bed for guinea pigs.  Fits 2 pigs.  Love that it comes with a clip so that you can attach it to the side of the cage and they're not dragging it around or knocking it upside down.,5
"I had a little trouble getting the product to spray out at first. Once the nozzle worked, a  whole lot of the product was wasted in my hand!  I put a little of the product in his Kong Toy along with the bone marrow treats.  My dog loves this treat!  Just wish it took him longer to lick the Kong empty.  He is a fast eater too.",4
"My German Shepherd loved this.  It was her Christmas gift.  However, she punctured the squeeky part in 3 minutes.  I kept the toy and I cut open a slit to replace the squeeky as I bought a huge bag of replacement squeekies for just such an occassion.",5
Love this product!,4
I bought the extra large for my 7 month old puppy and it is too large for her now.  Needed a large and will reorder in a month or two to see if she has stopped growing and will use her old harness until then.  Like the material and think she will too.,4
"Unlike the bottled version, this refill leaves a bleachy smell. Otherwise, you'd have no idea that this product was used (the whole point).",3
"When I first opened the box and took this out I noticed a large piece of the material had broken off inside of the log. When I reached in to grab it I noticed that the edges were extremely sharp. I sanded them down and put it in the tank, and I noticed the next day my Crowntail Betta was missing a great deal of his Dorsal fin. There is nothing else in the tank besides driftwood, plants, and gravel. Do not buy if you care about your fish.",1
"I can't believe it, but our dogs actually allow us to spray their teeth with this.  Our vet says our dogs' teeth are great, so it must work!",5
Dogs love them and they are the perfect size for calorie conscious owner parents.  Great training tool,5
these look like the date has expired. hard to read but it looks like they expired in march.,2
my cat wouldn't eat,1
Goes a long way and my dog loves the taste!  I didn't know how big this was before ordering.  It's pretty large and I have a small dog (16 pounds) but I cut it into about 5 pieces  and froze them.,4
"Thus was bought directly from SwaglyCat. It is the most horrible poorly-made (in China) piece of utter rubbish I have ever had the misfortune to buy online. There was glue residue EVERYWHERE all over it. Along the edge of the holes, running out of the sisal, the balls inside were covered in it. It is an insult to cat owners and there is no way on earth I was going to let our girl get anywhere near it as I consider it a DANGEROUS item. If she had chewed at the glue and then digested it I have no idea what would have happened. Swagly and Ocsoso should be embarrassed at having allowed something so shoddy out into the marketplace. Any positive reviews for this must be fake or by pet owners who simply don't care.",1
"Excellent and easy to set up portable guinea pig cage. Gives decent space for two pigs. Easy to clean, you can spray and wipe or put in washer. I can't say anything about the longevity because I upgraded my cage, but I use the wire part only as an outdoor exercise pen (with supervision) now.",5
DOGS LOVE!,5
"Gibson, my Chinchilla, doesn't always take to toys. I think the issue is that they're too difficult to hold and nibble,so he loved this one. Despite his rambunctious playing, the hook kept it in place nicely, and only gace out when he chewed through everything else and turned his attack on the rope. It took him a few days to reduce it to nothing, which I would call a success.",5
"My new kitten loses her little kitten mind over these toys, especially the feather-on-the-wand one. Highly recommended.",5
cute and easy to clean,5
He loves them but they come apart so easily. He has them unthreaded in about 5 minutes. Then can eat them and puke them up.,2
Our dog loves them,5
"Currently mixing Davis Chlorhexidine Pet Shampoo, Davis Benzoyl Peroxide Pet Shampoo and Davis Miconazole Pet Shampoo together and using them off label as a once a week* pretreatment for severe athletes feet and nail fungal infection. After hubby showers I put this mixture on his feet and then put his feet in baggies for a deep treatment for about 20 minutes. I then have him sit on the side of the tub and I scrub his feet and between his toes really well with salt to slough off as much dead skin as possible before using a pedi egg on the more rough patches. This is followed by prescription strength Nystatin 100,000 IU cream and a deep emollient moisturizer that I added a few drops of Turkish oregano oil and camphor oil to. This is the second treatment and his skin looks a lot better. There seems to be less cracking in the skin.  And the cracks he has seem to bee healing. I am also going to try painting his toenails with the gentian violet next time. The shampoos definitely have cut the odor wafting of his feet 100% and they are extremely mild to my hands and to his feet. They accept the added salt very well for the scrubbing part and while I realize that its the Nystatin 100,000 IU cream that is doing the bulk of the work on the candida the shampoo treatment is helping a lot.

* Hubby has grudgingly consented to this experiment and once a week was all I could negotiate, because it is time consuming.",5
"Size was way off!  I woukd not recommend using the chart provided.  I had to return the harness, and go elsewhere.",1
small but good,3
"I bought this bed for my 5mo Irish Wolfhound puppy, knowing that when he is fully grown it will not be large enough.  However I love the Coolaroo products and thought this would be great while he is growing.  We managed to put it together without too much trouble and once he got used to it he loved it.  But.....had I known that I would not be able to get the replacement cover for this size, I would not have bought it.  I have tried searching everywhere for an extra lage replacement cover, all to no avail.  I even emailed the customer service at Coolaroo USA and 24hrs later they responded saying I should contact one of their online retailers and ask them to order it.  They gave me a link to a site that *should* have it, but like all the others, the largest size was ""large"".  I emailed the customer service for this company to ask if they could special order it for me, but I am still waiting to hear anything back.  I am disappointed the company sells the small, medium and large quite readily and yet the extra large is impossible to find.  It would be nice to warn people of this small fact.  Beware if you expect to need a replacement!

***UPDATE***

Coolaroo Customer Service finally said I could order a replacement cover from their California warehouse and I ordered two, so that I have a spare in hand....while I am glad I have been able to get the covers, I would still like to see it made as readily available as the other sizes.  My puppy is 90lbs so the bed may not last him for an extended period of time, but I have another puppy who should get more use out of it, providing I can get the replacement covers.",3
"wish they stayed on better...they fit my 35 pound Aussie, but fall off one by one within a few hours; while they're on, however, she doesn't slip and splay like when they're off...she feels friskier when wearing them",4
"my dog just loves chewing on these bully sticks,a good chew lasts my small dog long time",5
Best pet carrier/kennel ever!!,5
My dog won't even get near this!,1
"This product has helped our arthritic fur baby SO much! It has brought her back to loving to go for walks again! She no longer groans when getting up from laying down, can jump up into and out of our bed and couch again! Thank You for such a Great Miracle Product!!!=",5
"dog tears that heck out of them. However, they last him (English setter) several weeks before one needs to be replaced.  Its a toy and he's a dog hell bent on trying to remove squeakers.  It gets them out so we keep and eye on him so that when he gets close we physically remove them.  He loves these toys.",5
Love it!!!!!!! Perfect for my maltese when I'm not at home.  He's only 7 pounds an it fits a small pad an small bed an food an water.  I still want to get 3 more sections to give him a bit more room when we are gone for the day.,5
These are the purrrrrfect replacement for the DA BIRD long stick. The feathers from that company are outrageously priced and these fit universally. I couldn't even get them out of the bag to put them on the stick before my cats were attacking them. A great bargain and will definitely order these again when my cats destroy these!,5
Love this bag and my babies do too!  they both climb in it when they know we are about to leave. So cute!,5
"Products works as describe. Fits my vehicle fine, and is easy to install. Should have bought a long time a go!",5
"This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the ""pegs"" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is ""buried"") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting.",1
It really works! Our pit mix gets way too excited on walks and this harness keeps her in check. We wish we bought this years ago.,5
They don't go after it like they did the Innova but our old cat has to be chased away from it.  He has kidney problems and the protein in the kitten food is too much for him.,4
"Deciding to feed our dogs a raw diet means adding in supplements to ensure they are getting everything they need to be strong and healthy. This has a great line up of vitamins and my dogs actually gobble these up! I have tried many different ones and end up sneaking them in their food by crushing them. My akita is notorious for liking the pills clean, then dropping them on the side of her bowl. GAH! My yorkie is not that picky, but I usually smoosh them cause she is so small. With these, I obviously cant tell how it makes them feel or what not, but I haven't noticed any decline in their skin, hair or digestive health from the last brand I crushed up for them. I add in salmon oil, kelp and probiotics to round out a good regimen to complete their diet. So far, they gobble them up everyday so I am happy! I purchased these discounted to test with my dogs to provide a genuine review from that experience.",4
Great groomer and my cat loves it.,5
"Poor poor product
It hurts them not gentle",1
"Way too big for my adult cat. The ears fit where they should, but the neck and head space is way too large and it falls all the way forward, so she can't see to walk.

If it fit, I think she would wear it as she is pretty friendly and docile. It would look cute on her, too. It seems like it should fit a dog, not a cat, the way it is shaped and sewn.

Too bad.",3
great product and service.!,5
it looks like broken sponge pieces and when you pick a piece out of the bag it crumbles into dust. Jack won't eat it and i don't blame him,1
"One of our cats will only use this scratching post, and he only use it upside down. Glad you can order refills.",5
"If you are buying a new biOrb tank you don't need to buy this. A bag should come with your biOrb. I hate that you have to have this for your biOrb tank and i don't like the fact it does not come in different colors. I feel BiOrb products are very pretty, but get pricey fast. Make sure to clean it and remove all the pea size pieces before putting it in your tank.",3
"Cat hates the smell, would only keep him off for 10 mins, if apply constantly I would have to leave the room, strong smell for human too",2
"This is a little smaller then I thought it was going to be.  My fish don't even swim through it.  But, it sit in the tank.",2
"Nice. Fits well in corner; cats seem to like it. Scooping is easy. Cats still track litter everywhere, but what can you do?",5
This was too big & heavy.  My cats completely ignored it.,2
"The packaging was great.  The product overall is fantastic.  My cat loves her new litter box.  I opted out on the black finish becuase the white one is only $75.  It is a great price!  If you do get this, I recommend purchasing a taller litter box.  If your cat is messy like mine, it will not get all over the place in there.  Now, I just need a mat for the front.",5
I wanted to take my dog on trips with me but he won't go anywhere near this. I put his toys in it and left it out so he wouldn't fear it and it doesn't work.,3
worked great. easy to use and set up.  only took our pup about 2 or 3 days to figure out she didn't want to get up on the table.  Its really the only thing we needed it for.,5
I now have three of these and my cats love them for when they are outside on the covered porch in their chairs-one chair didn't have one and they wouldn't lay in that one-so had to buy the third. When it gets a little wet from blowing rain-I bring it inside for a half hour and it's fully dry and I wipe off anything that gets on it. It dries very fast.,5
This collar fit our 65 pound yellow lab well and she did not mind it.  It looks very festive and people really enjoy seeing her in it.  I did have to add extra knots to the little bells as they were all loose and when the dog shook the little bells would go flying.  There are a lot of little bells so this took a awhile.  We'll keep it and use it again.,4
"You'll definitely notice a difference in your pets coat and physical health. Purina Pro Plan is the absolute best food that we have given our dogs. Believe me we have tried cheaper brands but this brand is the best. On every brand we've used, our dogs would she'd like crazy, not to mention had lots of upset stomachs, itchy rashes, or poor energy levels.",5
"Great product! Worked by the second shampoo. My beagle mix was having the worst dandruff. He's allergic to something outside, and it was causing him to have crusty lesions of flaking skin that would come off and leave angry red sores underneath. The vet prescribed an antibiotic which only worked for a short while, so I decided he needed a better solution. This shampoo is it! I'm so happy that he's now relatively itch free and the dander has been clearing up very noticeably since the second shampoo so that there are only a few random flakes left. I've given him four baths, and he has regrown healthy skin where it once used be be red or crusty. Happy beagle, happy life.",5
I've been through soooo many water bottles trying to find the best one that stays attached to the cage the best- so far this is my winner!  I definitely recommend this one.  I use it for my mini-rex bunny.,5
My dog loved it!!,5
"We've fed blue buffalo to our dogs for 10+ years.  Our Beagle just lived to be 16 and was in great health until close to the end.  Our boxer is going on 11 which is old for that breed.  We attribute their good health to good nutrition from Blue Buffalo!

Can't beat the price on amazon!",5
Fits & looks great on our dog!,5
"I love all of the Taste of Wild products. I rotate the favors and all of my dogs love the food. In a taste test, my girl choose to eat it right out of the bag over other products.",5
I have been using a cricket cube diet by Fluker's but it often gets maggots and they don't really seem to gobble it up. My crickets eat this up almost faster than I can pour it. Very clean and easy to use daily.,5
I bought this because I don't like something that is hard for my dogs to chew and they will swallow before actually chewing. They (4) totally love this. It is one of their favorites.,5
does the job for me,5
EXCELLENT.,5
Works great in my 29 gallon tank.,5
My frenchie needs half of cup 3 times a day... this will make measuring a breathe. Really heavy and thick plastic. Very happy!!,5
"As the title says, way too strong of a smell. I hate this stuff. I still smell like it hours after I scoop the litter box. If you are using this crap you need to make sure you scoop the littler box right before you intend to shower. And hold your breath while you're scooping. Horrible product, I can only wonder how harmful these odors are.",1
Just as advertised,5
"Have not noticed any improvement in my Boston Terrier at all and have used the entire bottle, very disappointing.",1
Great product,5
Good health food for my aging dogs.,5
The pup loves these toys.,5
My cat loves these and I good giving these to him instead of the ones will all the fillers.,5
"I have kept fish 50 plus years.  I can say that Spirulina20  has to be one of the best fish foods I have ever used.  The results in most aquarium fish have been superb.  It's gives great growth color anOr leaves lasting scars, trauma, psychological issUes and long if not permanent need for various methods of rehabd health AND is a great value.",5
"Worked wonderfully! My dog is no longer throwing up and pooping weird. whatever type of worm it was,(i don't know) this got rid of it. Had to buy two packs for my over 60 lb dog, but still was half the price the vet was charging. I recommend this dewormer. (:",5
Pups love it,4
"We used hard cylenders and soft neck inner-tubes.  This works best.  Out big pit can't get his head around it to nip at his neutering sutures, yet he can still see and walk around just fine.",5
Door latchopened and chinchilla got out and was very terrified,2
"Use them with the three cats, makes for a quieter breakfast and dinner time.",5
"I bought this fully expecting to get the usual mediocre results.  I have two small dogs and they love to pee all over the back yard which is covered inlarge gravel and not possible to wash down. It overpowered and killed all odor.  It has been several weeks that I applied it and I am not yet due to reapply it.  The bottle has enough for 2 or three applications depending on the size of the yard.
I highly recommend it.",5
Bought to use in the metal crate. Really soft,5
Daughter very happy with her new puppies winter sweater..,5
Dog loves these.,5
I use this for my two chinchillas. It's a big cage and offers a few ways to set it up which I love because I like to change up the cage every so often. This in my opinion is one of the best on the market.,5
My cat got sick every time she ate this. And now I find out I cannot get a refund???,1
"My dog loves it - and perfect for Great Danes who require more protein and cant tolerate corn, wheat, soy etc..",5
I was hoping this was the same as a similar product I bought a PetSmart.  But it is a cheap imitation and I came with black stains on it.,1
"The Comfy Cone is just that. Its as comfy as you can get with a cone on your head. You will notice in my pictures that my 40 pound half Labrador half Golden Retriever puppy is pretty comfy sporting her Cone. She was able to fit into the x-large kennel and had little issue turning around in the kennel. As you can see by the mud and dirt, she was still able to be a puppy in the yard. When walking through the house, bumping into walls and corners were easier on her shoulders and the walls in this cone. It was also easier on the back of my legs as she pushed up against me. The cone is pliable and easier for her to sleep with. It has elastic loops for her collar. There is a reflective piping to finish the outter edge of the cone. There are several firm and removable plastic pieces in the cone to help keep its shape. My pup is wearing a size large and it fit nicely with the option to increase the size should she need a cone in the near future.
She was able to eat and drink wearing it. However, sometimes she would accidentally flip her food bowl over if she caught the bowl with the cone. She was also able to pick up and play with toys.
What she could not do was lick her wounds. She loved ear scratches from me as her head was off limits from her paws.",5
"Still not sure what makes an unstuffed chicken toy ethical, but then I don't know why women watch daytime TV.  This was a crowd  favorite with our dogs but had a fairly short life as the pups did their best to render it ethically destoyed.",3
great large water bowl for my pit bull,5
OMG I have 2 of these they have saved my shoulders!,5
"My Chihuahua mix (13 lbs) dog took to this immediately! I've tried stairs - all kinds of stairs. He'd jump right over the stairs. This piece is fabulous. Its very substantial/sturdy. I think this was key to my dog actually using it. The brown color is a nice neutral brown and is a bit lighter in color than what is shown in the picture. The carpeting is a neutral beige.

I agree with the other comments about the carpeting not having enough tread - my dogs feet slip a bit but, that's only when he's standing on it for a few seconds. The important thing is, he uses it to get up on a high bed. I didn't need treats, encouragement, training or anything. He knew - immediately - what this was for.

This is one of the best purchases I've made in years. I'd highly suggest this.",5
"Made my dog sick. He started throwing up, his skin became loose, he had a fever, he was scratching and chewing himself everywhere after 2 weeks on this product. After 2 days off of this product he quit throwing up and being feverish. Still scratching and chewing but he's feeling better. His skin looks better. The Dr says he must have had an allergic reaction to something in it and if I had continued to give it to him he would have died. Thanks for making my baby sick and the $160.00 vet bill.",1
Absolutely love this canned food.  Best product around and it's the only food my two cats love without a doubt,5
"Work as they should. All my aquariums show accurate temps, even tested with separate digital probes. Nice to know what the water temperature is at a glance. Have these on all 13 of my tanks.",5
Fast shipping at a great price,5
"1 Star simply because the advertised ""Reverse flow"" option doesn't do anything meaningful.
When flow is reversed, the intake is not the outlet pipe which CAN be covered with a pre-filter sponge, but rather a new intake opens up, a narrow one, on the side of the filter (right above the yellow flow adjustment marker). That intake can't be covered up with a sponge. Also, in reverse flow mode, a small opening is still crated in the small intake pipe which reduces the flow down into the filter by about 25%.",1
"good and strong material.. nice colour, and easy to use. would love to order other size soon cos pup is growing up fast,",4
my dog loves these treats more than anything else,5
I have a small poodle and well behaved black lab.  We bought two of the shorter size and it has been great for us.  We have been traveling the US in a RV and it makes it easier for our dogs to get outside time.  Would highly recommend but would have to watch the height based on what kind of dog you have.,5
My dog loves these!,5
"My older dog has horrible gas.  This is a wonderful limited ingredient diet that works great for him.  It has tasty (my dog's opinion not mine) freeze dried raw bites that he loves and you can also by as a treat separately.  It is a bit pricey, but cheaper than the pet store.",5
Love it,5
"I own a double flap wall-mount Enduraflap pet door. I live in a cold and windy environment and previously owned a ""Ruff Weather"" double flap door. The Enduraflap is much better in high winds. However, for the price, I'm somewhat disappointed in the performance. At the bottom corners of the flap there exists small gaps in the seal which allow a noticeable persistent draft to enter the house. Twice I've emailed customer service about this problem, and they've never replied.

This isn't what one would expect from a company that brags about their products and their product support. It's too bad because this product could be adjusted slightly in it's design to address the issue. But that requires the manufacturer to listen to the complaint and they seem unwilling to do that.",2
"My boy kitty is a fetcher. He just loved to play fetch. He was wild for the Jack in the Box Jack head balls. Then he got  tired of them. Today the springs arrived and he's playing fetch again. A really fun toy for those kitties that are human and have human hands. Girl kitty is a mouser, and just loved to toss the squeeky mouse toys.",5
Bunny's favorite toy!,5
A little tricky for back seats but our puppy is enjoying the ride and she is safer than just on the floor or seat.,4
"My pups like it, however, with all I've been reading about the dangers of feeding and all kibble, I have to decide whether to keep purchasing it.",4
I love this stuff! I am so happy I made the jump to purchase this breath freshener. I did add a few more jobs of peppermint oil to make my dogs' kisses extra minty. Great natural alternative to other breath fresheners out there.,5
"the two very fussy boys play around with this thing a bit, whereas with other catnip toys, they just totally ignore them or look upon them with contempt.  LOL",4
"It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats!  There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her ""puppy dog"" eyes.  As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.

Teeth cleaning ability? We were only able to sample 1 bag up front, so I can not comment on how well they would do over time, but can say that they did appear to be soft and chewy and looked like they would clean teeth over a period of weeks.  As for her breath?  Again, not enough quantity to make a call one way or another, but she did not have what I would consider bad breath.

On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per...  If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them.  However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.

This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them.  In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.",5
"I can't seem to keep my dog away from my cat's food bowl and vice versa, my cat loves my dog's food; this is a happy medium since they eat each other's dry food anyways. It has taurine which is essenial for cats (and isn't common in many dog foods) and has enough protein and vitamins to meet the needs of both my cat and dog with no issues. My dog has sensitive skin and allergies and this hasn't given him any problems. Also his walks have produced solid number 2s, which my canine pal appreciates.",5
Easy to give and my kitties love them.,5
"This, and the Classic Chicken Feast are all my cat eats.  She is now about 12 years old, healthy and gorgeous.",5
I live these but they hang too low on my kitties- I don't want them to get hung up. The clip is great!! The bells are cute and pretty but they hang too low for us.,4
"Excellent product! This came in really handy with the cold spell we are having in Cincinnati. I was so happy that my feral cats had water to drink when they wanted it, and not a huge ice cube like last winter. My only complaint is the cord length, it really limits where you can put it.",5
excellent product i keep buying more an more,5
Marbel seems to like this stuff,4
This is the only food my Peppy gets!  He is one year old now and his coat is so shiny.  Do  your cat a favor and buy grain free food for him.  I've signed up for Amazon Subscribe and save for this food and save even more.,5
Excellent product...,5
"my bunnies like to dig and burrow.... I put this down where they mainly burrow at and they went at this thing like it offended their mothers. within a week they've got the ends of it torn up and have peed on it cause they are dumb. They frequently alternate between attacking it for their mothers honor and napping on it.

After they are victorious in its defeat I will probably buy them another",5
"Nice leash, feels sturdy and the one botton operation is very smooth. We'll see how it stands up to puppy rigors but so far I like it a lot.",4
Another amazing squeak toy by this company! Fun for owners and pets!,5
My cat loves this scratching post & I like that it's tall enough he can stretch out.  It also seems to be very durable.,5
My dogs love the taste.  My dog who has skin problems is not scratching as much.,5
My Shih Tzu loves these balls. They are the perfect size for his little mouth!,5
"Not sure if this works or not.  Cats are now getting along fine, two months later.",3
"I purchased the Medium Pet Feeder and the Ergo Pet Waterer in 2003 from the Ergo website.

First off, the timer that comes with the food is horrible.  It has great functions and is easily programmable, but over the course of 5 years I had 3 and they would just stop working.  I didn't realize I could use any appliance timer so I kept buying replacements from Ergo at $25 a pop.  When I finally found out any appliance timer would work, I went with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woods-59377-Digital-7-Day-Lamp-Appliance-Timer-with-2-Outlets-Up-to-8-On-Off-Settings-per-day-and-Battery-Back-Up/dp/B000IKQRTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woods 59377 Digital 7-Day Lamp/Appliance Timer with 2 Outlets, Up to 8 On/Off Settings per day and Battery Back Up</a>, it has all the same functions and is a sleeker design.  Not to mention it was over $10 cheaper.

Other than the timer issue, I couldn't be happier with the feeder 8 years later.  I use either Science Diet or Purina Beneful.  The Beneful is dispensed with no problem, but any food that is ""Large Bites"" will not.  If you change the size of the kernels, you may need to adjust the time duration it feeds. Larger kernels I find need to be set longer, but if I use smaller kernels and don't decrease the fall time, it overfeeds them.

I received the waterer at the same time an was initially satisfied.  Everything assembled well, but if you've used smaller auto wateres in the past, you know the warning sound it makes when it's low, this one doesn't and we burned out several pumps.  We eventually just got rid of all the filters and electronics and just use it a a gravity waterer.  This works well for us because we add teeth cleaners and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Dog/dp/B000633X14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Dog!</a>&nbsp;to the water and our dogs finish the water pretty quickly so it doesn't have time to get slimy or stale.

If you stay on top of the water level so you don't burn out the pump, it is a great machine.  However if you burn out the pump you have to buy a replacement from Ergo because they are a special size and you can't connect one externally due to the products design, it has a hole on the side that prevents use of another pump.

Works perfectly,5
My Rotti loves his kongs. I fill with his biscuits and seal the top with some cheese. Keeps him busy for at least 15 mins :),5
economical....cats must love it because  they drink more water now.  And they love to bat at the water as it falls from the spigot.,5
My fish seem to love it! They snap it up once it gets a bit soft from the water.,5
This was very thin and didn't provide any comfort from the plastic crate bottom. My dog didn't want to sleep in her crate at all until I bought a different mat and now she's back in there all the time. Spring for the more expensive one. I ended up donating this one and paying for another one anyway.,2
I couldn't get rid of the fleas last year. Bought Vectra last year by a colleagues recommendation and it worked fast.,5
"I have been using this for years. I first discovered it in a health food store. A full bottle will last me about a year with my 10 lb dog. It's natural, not tested on animals, smells good, and works well with sensitive skin.",5
"I have two mini poodles and a Portie. They love the Pedigree dentastix  but Blue has better health rating so we got large bag.  Well not one dog will take it, they all walk away. ""Hysterical"".  It's either the scent turns them off or they are already expecting Dentastix which they run for.",2
"I have a ten year old Pug who I love dearly.  A couple of months ago, he started really struggling to get up and down stairs and seemed to have some difficulty controlling his back legs.  I came across this product and I really, really(!) hoped it would make a difference.  I've purchased three bags now, but unfortunately it just does not seem to be having any effect on him.  I gave this product two stars because although Otis is real finicky when it comes to dog treats, he seems to like this one and readily devours it.  I'm so glad that it seems to be effective for other people's dogs, but it didn't help mine.",2
"I love this collar! The design is unique and my pup is always getting compliments on it. The martingale style is nice because it's more secure than a snap collar and gives me more control on our walks. Plus, it has a lifetime guarantee even if chewed! How can you beat that?",5
My dogs love chewing on these.  It helps them to not chew on other items when they have bully sticks.,5
MY DOG IS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT HE WILL NOT TOUCH IT EVEN IF HE IS HUNGRY,2
I highly recommend this product.,5
Great product! I would recommend to my friends,5
"Our German Shepherd prefers Chuckit toys to any of her others. This bumper toy is easy to throw and is easy for her to catch. The bright colors make it easy to see, day or night. Finally, Chuckit toys are super durable, even for our German ""Shredder""!",5
"These are awesomely big! My dogs love them! And they really are low odor, even better!",5
"Nice small tank.  I have 5 neon tets in it and it stays clean.  That being said, the light system goes bad after a very short time.  I got it replaced with little effort one time but it was beyond the 90 day warranty the second time.",3
"Love the way the Jetstream ink flows! Easy to write, which helps a lot when I grade about 100 student papers per week. I only wish I had bought the retractable pens instead of the pens with lids. I keep losing the lids. Pens still work though.",4
Just received this coat in the mail today! Fits well and stays secure! Its super adorable as well! We are ready for the spring rain!,5
Nice and works good but it pretty heavy when filled. To have to turn it upside down without spilling water after you fill it is kind of difficult.,3
This is a product is one that your Chickens will love and at a good price  and Great service,5
Too small,3
I bought so many of these that didn't fit. My husky had hurt his paw and needed protection to go for walks. The booties helped a lot. Not too bulky like the hard sole boots.,5
"I ordered my aquarium plants from InvertObsession because a reviewer talked about how it is a small business that cares for its stock.  The plants arrived on time and were in good condition.  The packing was excellent!  My only complain is that my Java fern was a little smaller than the advertised 3x5.  However, I understand that when it was packed it shrunk a little (2x4).  I like the fact that I had a surprise in my bag ... an assassin snail!  This little snail made my day!  The snail sales for about  $5 - $10.  This beautiful snail eats other snails, algae, and detritus.  Thank you for the gift InvertObsession!  My plants are doing well, and the little snail is doing his job!",5
I use stress coat on all my tanks. great stuff,5
"I can't say enough about this skimmer.  It was a little loud in the beginning and lots of micro bubbles returning to the tank had me concerned at first.  A week later I can't hear it at all.  When I empty the collection cup the skimmate stench will make your eyes roll back in your head, which is a good thing.  Bad smell = lots of gunk no longer in your water column.  I still have a few micro bubbles but it's loads better than in the first week.  I leave the air intake line wide open which probably doesn't help. Just ordered the add-on bubble trap.  Should be here tomorrow.",5
"I bought this back in January and it works just as well as it did when I first got it. Easily to clean off when algae builds on it, if at all. I never have trouble keeping this down.",5
"i got this for my office. while i like the size and shape of the tank, there were a bunch of problems with it.

the lighting rusted out and fell apart very quickly. the lid hole to feed the fish through doesn't work at all and the tube in the middle takes up a ton of room and doesn't really aerate the tank very well. and my guppies keep getting stuck in it, even though it has a lid.

also, the under-gravel filtration is a joke. unless you hang a giant filter on the tank, it doesn't work very well and you have to clean out the rocks instead of just doing water changes and filter changes. cleaning out the rocks is super impractical in an office setting.

 i am actively looking for a new home for my guppies.",2
"Right out of the shipment box we opened the top of this storage container for the first time and the rubber that fits into grooves on the top to create the air tight seal, fell off completely and into the buckets. We were able to get the rubber stuffed back into the grooves and it seems to s*** well now. The rubber has stayed in place after opening and shutting it a few times to test it.
I'm 5'4 and the container stands right u see my knees. It fits perfectly under our lowest shelf in the pantry. I didn't look at the measurements and worried after ordering that it would take up much more room than it does.
The opening to use daily for feeding is the perfect size to fit our measuring scooper in and out without problems.
There was a very strong plastic smell on the inside that was easy to get rid of by simply washing and letting it air dry outside for an hour.

There are a few negative about this container. It is made of a very cheap plastic. I worry that the latches that secure the whole top shut will not hold up.
There are no wheels on the container nor is it designed with a bottom that will easily slide if it needs to be moved once full.
While I do believe that at least certain areas should have been made using a more durable plastic, this is the most convenient storage container and best design to be able to keep inside our pantry without taking up a huge area of space.  This would even fit in very small pantries
Holds our 63 pound bags of dog food with room to spare",2
"Absolutely can not beat the price for these filters. I use them on a 30gallon tank...change the filters weekly as I have some Very Large Goldfish. Nothing fancy in the these fish, but I've had them so long now that their just part of my life!!! Gotta keep their tank clean and clear...
Great filtering pads, I have even removed them and rinsed them and put them back in place in order to get longer use from them, I've not had any problems with them. I will continue to purchase these filters from this seller....",5
This is such an awesome cat tree. Our growing kitten just loves it. It was easy to put together and she played on it right away! This cat tree rocks!,5
Works well. Good quality. Would purchase again. Good price.,5
"A must have this product is! I have two cats that I love dearly, but when potty time comes along and a number #2 is deposited into the littler box,  to keep breathing one does need to plug ones nose, after the offending potty is deposed of, the littler box still can stink, this product I have found after trying many other products takes care of it the best. This deodorizer has a fresh clean scent and does not overwhelm me, as some I have tried in the past have. I would recommend the product as well as the seller. Thank-you",5
Works Great.  Love the lenght.  The lock is easy to use. My dog loves the extra runway.,5
"My pug needed to have a collar for a month and this was great! She didn't really like it the first time I put it on, but then she got used to it, and it was very easy to remove and clean (since it accumulated a lot of hair and it smelled bad in the inside within a few days).",5
My pug enjoyed these very much.  Will definitely buy these for him again.,5
Good,5
"General Mills has recently purchased Blue Buffalo.  We haven't noticed a change in the food yet, but for sure the price per pound has increased.",3
"Definitely does the job of eliminating the urine odor. My puppy has had a few accidents in the house. I usually press down on it with a towel or paper towels to absorb out the urine, then I generously squeeze the product over the spot and allow a few days for it to dry. Carpet is brand new afterwards.",5
"All my fish love it save my white cloud minnows, even the catfish go for it if the others aren't quick enough.  Between 7 tanks of fish, good product, a great stable diet for all my little ones.",5
"Only in my tank (30 Gal. hi) about 2 weeks. Fish seem more active, ph is down a little and a slight tint to the water. Pleased for now",4
My dog is very picky and this is about the only treats he will eat. He loves them!!!,5
Okay jacket. Bought it for our growing 4 month old puppy. The material started to come off the neck piece and fell apart in less than 10 uses. Only good as used for a short amount of time but would not buy if needed for the whole boating season.,3
Love it and the folks at Pet Classics are beyond terrific.  Great service.  One of the tags got lost in post and they replaced it asap and were very nice.,5
Great price on amazon..I was paying almost three times this amount from the vet,5
"Our dog, Cleo, loves this! She'll catch it in midair every time ... when we throw it right, :)",5
Only wish the bowls were deeper but this is a great height for our Shepherd  mix and very sturdy. Shes pushes it around the floor when demanding food if I forget and it never tips over. Bowls hold approximately 5 cups dry food or water comfortably. Bowl holders at the height of the animal are better for their digestion. They are less likely  to inhale. their food causing upset.,4
I like this product..Would recommend,4
"You know those infomercials of grooming tools making piles of hair?  For my dog, this does that!

My short hair dog (a rescue mutt with some Staff Terrier in her) loves the feel and hair goes flying and keeps flying and keeps flying and keeps flying.  The first time I used it, I was actually shocked and a bit worried for a minute.  I still have no idea when to stop because hair just keeps coming off. Truly, I'm amazed at how much hair comes out.  It's messy because of the amount of hair so you should do this outside at least the first time to gauge for yourself.  Her  coat looks great after, all shiny.

This tool is easy to hold and easy to maneuver over and around my dog.  It's soft & rubbery.

Have to admit that having seen the YouTube videos I tried the Shedmonster (a Furminator type tool), and it did nothing for my dog.  Was a waste of money.  It may work for your pet, but did not for mine.  Instead this $8 ZoomGroom produced results like those videos.

Happy owner (less shedding in the house); happy dog (frequent massages).

Just reading these reviews, I'll have to try using the ZoomGroom for bath time too.",5
Bought this poop scoop for the grass in the dead of winter with a few feet of snow on the ground. The rake looks sturdy enough and will probably work quite well when we finally have grass again!,5
Love it,5
"Okay - a bit misshapen in the head - there's not really a curve there, if you know what I mean.",4
This is a very nice container. I didn't buy it for dog treats instead I purchased it a Urn for my dearly departed ashes.,5
Well made.,5
I've purchased a few of these toys and am thrilled with them all! My very large harlequin macaw hasn't even put a dent in these and he's incredibly rough on toys. Worth way more than I paid!,5
as shown,5
I have an extremely fussy yorkie out of multiple dog foods he seems to eat this one best. just wish Amazon would stock more of the small breed bags 4 and 10 lb.,5
"This is the replacement foam for my dogs filter. It works great. The only problem I have is it has only one change in it.
The other piece you need comes with three changes. It's the Replacement Filter Cartridge.",5
"Disappointed. Just got the bandana and when I took it out of the package it was dirty. Appears stained, If it was a real flag, I would have to burn it as it is damaged. If it wasn't for the stains on the bandana, it looks like it would be a nice accessory. I got the bandana to dress up my German Shepard for a welcome home event for returning Vets next week, but I will need a different accessory for the event.",2
"My dog loves it, but she cuts her gums on the rubber and makes her teeth bleed.",3
great for dogs,5
Dogs love 'em!,4
My very picky little Brussels thinks he went to doggie heaven with this added to hydrate his kibbles.,5
Great product,5
"My dog loves them!  And it is a good product, a delicious treat and is good for teeth!",5
great,5
My daughter's dog LOVES this stuff. He gets it as a treat when he goes to the vets and behaves well. It's very convenient and easy to administer through his basket muzzle.,5
"These balls are HUGE & GORGEOUS! Came packaged well and very clean. Excellent price compared to the pets store. Buy them, you won't regret it!",5
My dog loves the taste of this toothpaste and therefore licks/bites down constantly as I brush his teeth with a finger brush but I've figured out a method to still do a good job brushing his teeth. Otherwise he lets me brush his teeth without running away.,5
"After spending > $70 to get two small dogs groomed each time I visit a major Pet Market, I decided to get clippers to do the job myself.  Though I'm still trying to get the hang of clipping areas like joints, around the ears, face, etc, the clipper is fairly easy to use.  It's quiet.  I like it...but my dogs to a lesser degree when I'm cutting around the face.

The major issue with this clipper is that it gets very warm after 10-15 minutes of use.  Fortunately, the plastic thingamajig that goes over the metal keeps it from burning the dogs.  The metal gets hot to the touch.

Other than that, it's quite a neat little clipper.",3
Great product!  This is a pretty heavy duty groomer!,5
love it,5
Nice hut! No issues,5
"got this based on reviews, my cat is a picky eater and she loves these. I break them into halves or fourths",5
"may work for cats, but leash gets disconnected from the collar right away, very poor connection",1
My dog really likes this brand for some reason. I prefer others but he likes this one best.,5
Short compared to others.,3
"Keeps our puppy clean and from having to bathe excessively. He doesn't mind them and they clean off dirt and whatever mess he gets into great, smells good too!",5
My dog loves these treats as training snacks.,5
"I'm sorry to say this was  total waste of money--it was broken within 5 minutes if bot less.  Our st. Poodle puppy has the bigger version which is wholly in tack and she has a lot fun with.  So we thought it would be ice to have this smaller version.  Not good.  It was hard to hold the ball and snap the picture at the same time with the iPad, but I hope you can see what I mean.",1
Cats love them like the larger package,5
"I throw like a woman, well after all I am a woman but this chuckit makes me throw like a super woman. My dogs can actually cover some ground before bringing the ball back.",5
"We have one of our cats that occasionally has a urinary tract problem, so I started buying the Purina One formula, so far
this has really helped the problem.  We feed it along with another Purina product to all 3 off our cats and they love it.

We have always bought formula from same vendor on Amazon, and are please with the service.

Thanks",5
Just ass I ordered and work properly,4
"They fit my pee pee chihuahua guy perfectly, no more pee to clean up on the floor!",5
Dog loves it and it's very soft and durable.,4
"I am not a big fan of test kits.  I am lazy and usually just take it to the lfs and have them do it.  However, I decided to try the Thrive Analytics (will save this for another review) and thus had a need to test more often.  The test is spot on for Magnesium.  However, I don't know if my kit is defective for Alk or not but the color is supposed to change from blue to yellow.  But mine mostly changes from Blue to clear.  I have a Hannah Alk tester and it is much easier to use. SO 5 Stars just for MG and 0 for the Alk part.  I also did use this to test calcium and it actually tested close to what my LFS tested it at.  So, it will actually work for Ca in an emergency.",3
"I just adopted a little Maltese mix dog and since my Bichon has never liked any type of bows in her hair, I had no experience with putting them on.  Since the Maltese needs a topknot to keep her hair out of her eyes, I wanted something that also looked cute on her.  I tried creating my own but they continually fell out.  I decided to try these feather bows and I am so happy with them.  While they do shed a bit, especially while putting them on, it's no more than one would expect from any feathery item.

The elastic band that is attached is thick enough to easily let me wrap it around three times without breaking.  I have been so surprised that not only does she keep it in all day, even while rolling around on the rug, but also all night.  One of the other things that I like is that it really doesn't have to be centered perfectly to look adorable.  My bows always were off center and gave her a lopsided look but the feathers just look like a crowning touch even put on by my inexpert hands.  :)",5
"My Frenchie wears this out at night only and it started falling apart within a few weeks.  This is what it looks like after a year of wearing it once daily.  I contacted the company to see if they will replace it given the description said life time warranty.  It holds a charge for a very long time, but again, we only use it once a day at night to see our little guy in the yard.",2
Tough and my dog loves it.,5
"For regular clumping litter, this box is the best and worth every penny! The liner is the best part. Makes it so easy to dump the litter once it needs to be replaced and unlike plastic bag type litters, the cats don't scratch it and put holes in it. I have had my liner for MONTHS and not replaced it. AND you can hose it off if needed. The box also prevents litter from going everywhere. Highly recommend.",5
Took my dog a while to get used to it but  now she seems to enjoy it. Long handle on brush works better than fingertip brush.,5
"My kitten, who was an eating machine, wouldn't eat this.  She loved her Wellness kitten cans, she loved Royal Canin Babycat kibble and Mommy plus Baby kibble.  Even my elderly cat, who loves kitten food more than anything, wouldn't eat the CORE kibble.  We finally found a Royal Canin kibble for older kittens, and she eats that, along with her Wellness cans.

I think we wound up chucking this.",1
"I might have liked this booster seat if it had not had the cut-out in the front.  Our dog finds it comfortable and enjoys laying in it when in the house.  In the car, however, our (15 lb.) dog has a tendency to fall or slide through the opening when we are turning or come to a sudden stop.  If he were laying down, he would probably be fine, but he likes to sit or stand up and look out the windows.  The restraining strap seems totally ineffective in stopping this chain of events. I do not recommend this booster seat to any dog owner.",2
"These pellets are easy to keep clean. I use hand sanitizer that I glob onto a paper towel after scooping the poop. If you keep them clean, they last longer than a couple of weeks. Mine last a month or more before I need to change them. I also clean the entire litter box with hand sanitizer after poop scooping, in between the changing of the litter pellets and major cleaning of the box and urine pad pan.

I do recommend wearing cleaning gloves when cleaning a litter box. One can get toxoplasmosis from litter boxes and this can be extremely dangerous, especially for an unborn baby. Therefore, as I wrote in my review of the Breeze system pads, pregnant women should NEVER clean litter boxes. Put that on your loving husband's ""honey do"" list. After all, ladies, we do the heavy lifting, carrying our babies. Dad can clean the litter box, if it's not already one of his duties, whilst mama does the most important job of keeping unborn baby and herself healthy.",5
"These are really great nail clippers.  I have 3 small dogs (under 20 lbs) and clipping their nails was easy.  The handle is very comfortable to hold and its a nice, quick snap.  There is a safety panel on the back that prevents overclipping.",5
This is precious! Everyone who sees it LOVES how cute it is. I've had it several months. It is tiny and is intended for VERY small dogs. This makes a wonderful photo prop for your pooch.,5
Well made and was easy to install.,5
"High quality material that's perfect for cat scratching; unfortunately, my cats don't care about it, haven't used it (not even to sleep on) and while the measurements are listed, some might find it on the small side (depending on the size of your cat). It's slep-resistance is based entirely on what type of floor or fabric it's setting on; on some carpets it stays perfectly in place; on others, it slides around as soon as one paw steps on it.",3
Cat loves his bed.,5
have had these for 6 moths now and my 2 GSDs love them ! having extra cases is a bonus when other set is in the wash.,5
won't eat it. :(,2
"I have been using Nature's Miracle since we first got our pup nearly two years ago. He was slow to training, so I used it a LOT back then! I just bought the gallon refill (which was much more reasonably priced than the quart-size I'd been getting from the vet). The little fellow is house trained now, but still gets the occasional stomach upset, and usually manages to find a rug! Nature's Miracle gets rid of the smell, and the spot.",5
"I bought this to use with my black lab in the winter so I could put my hands in my pockets. It's great, just throw it over your shoulder and go. It would definitely only work if your dog is really well trained on the leash, otherwise you might get dragged.

I've used it a couple of other ways too (full length for training and obedience classes) and it's great all around.",4
"Do you remember the children's story about the emperor's new clothes?  That's my experience with this harness. A lot of people rate it highly here on Amazon, but it's downright naked-- in quality.  Touted for its adjustments & its comfort-- with my dog, 21 lbs, it strikes out.  According to size chart, she needs a small. And the small fits her midriff, but I canNOT adjust this harness enough so it fits her chest area.  Also, the front-loading hook for a leash (the best place to hook a lead when training) is very difficult to access and it's already deteriorating, after only 45 days use (and not every day use at that).  Ruffwear, at this price, why not put another metal hook there, rather than the fake-leather ring?  ALSO, without a proper fit the harness scrunches up, slides around.  OM Goodness, why did I buy this thing?",2
perfect fit,5
"Got it, Thanks!",3
My cat is in love with these so naturally he loved this one. He even loves to take his cat naps on it. Great product and fast shipping!,4
My older cats are eating it when mixed into their canned food. Looks like it helps with sore joints.,4
"ferrets love it, put it in the corner so they don't poop there, works and the love playing with it",5
Only thing that worked,4
The battery pack broke the first day and would not stay inside the collar. My husband had to put a strap around it to hold it. I loved the collar itself when it worked the few minutes it worked. It's just not at all durable.,1
I have tried other combs this one worked perfect for my yorkie's it reached the small areas that needed combing. Item just as described.,5
Keeps water clear.,5
My dog loves these treats.  We use them as a stinky treat for special rewards during her training.  She loves them.  It is a little difficult keeping these in your pocket because they crumble so they may not be the ideal training treat.  Made in USA label and it appears to be a healthier treat.  It gets my dog to do her sits and stays no problem.,5
Only fuzzy toy that lasts a reasonable time period for my doxie. I just keep sowing them back up.,5
Everything and more! I was suspicious of the scoop but it works great. Took a learning curve on how much to pull out before u cut and still have enough tie a knot in the top before you dispose it. You don't want waste too much bag but if u get too little you can't tie it. I do wish it held more before you had to pull the slide out to dump waste in bag. I have to do this several times while scooping but I have two cats. I think it great!!!,5
I use this for my Leopard gecko.  He loves it. It's easy to refill and clean.,5
Keeps the pup busy,5
Nice product,5
MY DOGS LOVE THESE TREATS,5
"it became shaved down quickly. with the amount of the toy disappearing, i felt it was dangerous to continue using it. i can buy 2-3 of other brands for same cost.",3
"My 10 year old spaniel has been suffering terribly with chronic colitis for over a year. During that time, I have spent several thousand dollars at the vet, tried multiple medications, and literally spent another $7-800 on OTC products and special foods to try to heal this problem. Now, interestingly enough, canned pumpkin did not do the trick, but THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT, is the only thing that has helped my girl to have some relief. No, it doesn't correct the situation perfectly, but it has given her much relief and a definite and reasonable improvement of all gastric symptoms. I either sprinkle a teaspoon and a half on her wet food and mix it in, or I simply mix it with water and give it to her immediately after she eats which she actually likes. My sincere thanks to the company!",5
"I have a 97 pound lab & this crate is perfect for her. She is crate trained, so doesn't attempt to get out, though she probably easily could. Crate is EASY to set up and take down, roomy! Exactly what I was looking for.",5
Don't waste your money!,1
Neutral on this - love this brand but neither of my rescue dogs wanted anything to do with this - was trying new chews to see what they'd like.  They are both very chicken oriented vs beef.  Strange dogs.,3
"It works great, just like I expected it to.",5
This is a really solid collar. The leather is pretty thick and seems quite durable. My dog has had it on for a few weeks and there is little sign of wear.,5
We have 3 cats and they all have claws; one is even blind.  Seems to work!  Sprayed the places we didn't want the cats scratching a few times the first week and....No damage to our new furniture.,5
"This is the perfect soft sided carrier for our 7-9 pound cats.  One is very long, but he fits in there just fine.  Plenty of visibility and stylish to boot.",5
Our petsitter uses only slip leads so we tried it. We only use this now. We've tried the half-choke collar but this is much better. The dog doesn't pull and she doesn't fight it. It almost relaxes her.,5
Gets my doggie's tummy back to normal after he has eaten something he shouldn't eat.  The least little tidbit of human feed upsets his digestive system.  I add it to the white rice and boiled chicken breast with some sweet potato and within a couple of days he is much better.  This is a nice big jar so I will use as a support system along with his regular dog food.,5
"The pails I received had TWO hooks, not one, as I had needed. Returned.",1
"I bought this collar for my Alaskan Malamute puppy, thinking to use it after she gets spayed - the day after it arrived she started her first heat cycle!  So it got immediately pressed into service keeping her from ripping off the diaper she had to wear.  I have used traditional e-collars, comfy cones, and inflatable ""donut"" collars on dogs in the past, and each had their downsides.  The BiteNot was effective at keeping Stella from getting to her diaper, but did not get in her way or reduce her range of vision like other collars have.  This will definitely be used again when she gets spayed in a few months.",5
My dogs chase the Kong frisbee and we go through at least one a month. I was hoping this would last longer. I cant throw this one as far and it doesnt float as long. I can throw the Kong about 300 ft. My dogs cant pick this one up at a full run on the ground because its stiff. It also doesnt roll on the ground at all. I guess Im going back to Kong.,3
Three large dogs and 2 months after Christmas - Mr Squirrel is still hanging in there!,5
Nice sweaters  at a great price.,3
"Kitty loves it, I love it b/c finicky kitty gobbles it up.",5
This little pet crate is so adorable for my 4-lb girl. She fits in it really we'll and can see everything going on around her. It was easy to put together right out of the box and snapped into place without a hitch. Now Chi has a place to call her own!,5
"At first my goat wasn't into these, then she was all about them!",5
Fast Shipping! Excellent Quality! Thank you!,5
Perfect,5
"Just ordered my third package of these. My 13 year old, 52 lb. pit bull has been a quivering nervous Nellie her whole life. I tried another brand of these treats with no noticeable result so I was extremely skeptical that these would work. But she has been getting one treat a day for about 6 weeks now & the transformation is remarkable. She approaches strangers on her own, doesn't shake like a leaf for her twice-weekly physical therapy appointments, and asks to play CONSTANTLY. She acts like a puppy around the house. It's not a magic pill- she's still a fearful dog- but it's a HUGE improvement. I never thought they would work but my dog is happier than she's ever been so I'm sold. Wish I had found these sooner.",5
looks good.  well made.  having the arm (leg?) holes a plus.,5
"All of my cats adore these treats. One cat in particular nags me constantly to feed him some and if I don't give him enough, he jumps up beside me and pokes me repeatedly with one claw. Great price, too!!!",5
"For the money, a decent hat, but oh my that head band is tight... and I'm a bit of a pin-head! Not comfy after a bit, but it keeps the sun off and is actually well made",4
"Product always works well.  Would be better for the price if I can get it now at what I paid for it when I ordered this.  Now the price is just ridiculous.  Went to another brand because of it, they work ok.",4
"My shredder Aussie actually kept this in one piece for several days.  The little house for the squirrels wasn't made as well as the squrrels, but he enjoyed it.  As far as a learning tool?  Not really.",4
One of the only pet foods my cats will eat.,5
"This toy works better than I thought it would have.  Admittedly this toy was initially supposed to be used as an in between chew toy until more deer antlers arrived and I was very surprised that they lasted as long as they have.  My puppy is a destructive little chewer, but these toys are surprisingly durable so I would definitely have this if you have a chewer.",4
good product,5
"This is my second order of the 300 count waste bags.  These are great.  The lavender scent's a plus, they are biodegradable, and the type of box they come in makes them so easy to pull off one of more at a time.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to order them.",5
Keeps the cat litter pan smelling much better.,5
Use this. I cannot say I've had anything better when it comes to stains. I have a cavachon and a berner. Get it. You will love it. And it smells so sweet.,5
"Shampoo seems average. Our miniature schnauzer puppy is clean with no negative reactions to shampoo. I purchased to moisturize her coat during the winter. We do leave on for at least 3 minutes of the suggested 5 as she doesn't have any skin conditions or irritations. Her coat doesn't seem to be any easier to detangle. There is an odd scent reminiscent of cherry cough drops that seems to be fairly long lasting, scent is still present 5 days after last bath. Not an awesome shampoo, but certainly not terrible. Please note my comment above, puppy does not have current skin irritations so I cannot testify whether or not shampoo works for those.",3
This product seems to clear the water and help with fish waste,4
Great tool for getting into the little crevices,5
"They were good, but we switched to a low priced product",4
my dogs play with it once in a while,3
WOW. My cats ate the food when they got hungry. Incredible,5
Used it all. Nice smell and goes on well to the dogs fur. Would get again.,5
"Bags arrived quickly. They have a nice, subtle scent. They are large enough, and the handle ties are great. They seem a bit thinner than other bags I've had, but they work fine.",4
"Our dogs don't always like the dry food we buy, and canned food often upsets their stomachs, even the premier brands. Purina One works well for them and they like it.",5
Great price and product!,5
"My dog loves it. I fill it with Zuke's Mini Naturals dog treats (small pellets) and set in on the ground when she's showing signs of boredom. She noses it around the office and it occupies her for 10-20 minutes, unless it gets stuck behind something (which does happen a lot).
The white divider inside is supposed to limit how fast the treats come out, but I find the dog can never get all the treats out with the divider in place.  So I just remove the divider and the small opening on the outside of the ball limits the flow of treats well enough.",4
I am anxious to try it. It is winter here in the mountains with either snow or slush  so have not been able to use it. I have MS and need to use walking sticks to walk and it frees up my hands to use  Both walking sticks  probably will give it a five when I get a chance to try it. I have a 50 pound dog and 20 pound dog,4
She loves it.,5
"Addictive song! We loved the Monkey, and it was our dogs favorite toy. After he chewed off the face, both legs, an arm, a hand, tail, and both ears, there wasn't much left to the little monkey, but he still played the deedle song!  After our dog finally ripped his belly open and pulled out the song gizmo, we had to throw it away. Just wish it was a bit more durable. We had to sew it together 3 times to get to this point.",4
"Neither of my dogs are interested in these, and one is a puppy. Puppies usually chew anything and everything.",1
My favorite litter for my litter robot,5
Really easy and safe to use. I used this on my husky puppy and had no problems. Great purchase.,5
"My dog eats the entire strip,& sometimes gags on them.  I have now cut them in half  before I give them to her.  Think because they're so thin she eats them too fast & doesn't chew probably.",3
Pups LOVE this,5
My first purchase lasted about 6 months before I had to purchase another. But it works for the price.,3
All OK,5
"Our cats like the Classic variety Fancy Feast best.  They will eat the Chunky, but don't like the flaked at all.  They lick the gravy or juice off it and leave the rest.  Also like the Pate.
Thank you.",5
My Maltese puppy loves this food! The pieces are tiny so its easy for him to eat.,5
"Love the self-cleaning aspect of this brush. Nicely made. My only negative is it's a little clunky to handle. I'm used to being able to ""feel"" the brush action as I brush my dogs. I can't feel anything because it's thick. I'm sure I'll get used to it.",4
"Adds some nice color and has a weighted bottom. The leaves are cupped, so a bit of work to clean...",4
My puppy lovea it keeps him busy.,5
My dog love them,5
"This food is the ""highlight""...or addiction of the day for my cats. It is so helpful to be able to order this with free shipping regularly as needed. I hope you keep the ""Classic"" texture of food available. They like it better than the other kinds.",5
"This puppy food has always worked great for us. Puppies eat it well, and have always done great on it. We have used Hills science diet dog food for years raising yorkshire puppies, they have always done better on science diet, than any other food we tried.",5
"My name is Princess Dixie Wiggles, and I am a 12 month old Jack Russell/Dachshund mix.  My mom bought this toy for me, but she should have paid attention to the negative reviews, because I destroyed this toy in about 30 minutes - ripping it in to small pieces and pulling the squeaky thing out of the middle.  Good thing I'm such an intelligent pooch, or I could have choked!

My mom will be returning this toy - or what's left of it.  Not recommended unless your pup isn't one to chew on stuff.",2
This is much bigger than I imagined.  It's perfect and my african grey loves it.  I especially like the sides.  Keeps messes inside the cage instead of all over the floor.,5
"This is a great soft toy to use in training puppies.  The texture and feel of this toy really interests puppy. I train Belgian Malinois and this toy is not for adults  or older puppies of this breed,  This toy is not for aggressive and obsessive chewers.  I intend to buy for as I train young puppies.",5
"I've tried several harnesses for my small dogs(4lbs). These are the best, most comfortable and easiest to put on! My little ones absolutely love them!",5
I've been using this to raise my general hardness for my live bearers and snails. One dose usually does the trick for about a week. I do weekly light vacuum and a mid week water change usually.,5
"I have an older dog that uses these frequently because of medication, and over the years I have tried almost every brand of pee pad out there. These are one of my favorites because they are thicker than a lot of brands and they don't leak through the bottom. A lot of them claim to not leak but this one really doesnt. The price is also affordable for the amount. Definitely will keep buying this brand.",5
My cat rarely eats an entire can of friskies but she licks up every little bit of this stuff.,5
My pets like these but even with an extra large selection some pieces are very small and can be consumed in a couple of minutes.,3
I was looking for a replacement for my other fountain that my kids ended up breaking. I am glad I chose this one. It is large enough to last a whole week with my 2 small dogs and 3 cats. Stainless steel is a plus,5
"We bought this toy after my wife saw something on Pinterest where you roll up treats in long pieces of felt and let your dogs pull them out as if they were tearing up an animal or ripping up a toy.  It's a great idea, and they really enjoy it.",4
"Since you're reading this review, I guess you've already liked Umbra's FishHotel enough to care. As a pet lover like you, I urge to be open-minded to my points and read on.

I have been a proud owner of 6 betta fish for a year now, and between the 6 of them, my fish have given me many challenges, e.g. rotting tail, tailing biting, etc., that may qualify me as Umbra's FishHotel aquarium reviewer more than other reviewers here. Thus, I recommend that you stay away from this product.

As a betta beginner, I used to house my fish in this aquarium. It was all fine and dandy for the first month. Then, my bettas started bitting their tails, got their tails infected, and just stayed in one place, not swimming around happily like they used to. Worried, I researched and tried everything to fix the problems, from changing the water more often to give them live food. Nothing worked until I put each of them in a 2.5-gallon tank with heater and slow filter. The 2.5-gallon was big enough to put more plants and a couple of wooden logs for hiding places for my bettas. Now they are truly happy and I hardly have to do anything except for feeding them.

The lesson that I learned was that this aquarium is just TOO SMALL for a betta.

Amazon's dimension for the white case is accurate that it's a 7.5"" wide x 7.5"" deep x 8"" high, but notice that the glass bowl is 1"" shorter, which barely gives a betta a gallon of water to live in. Since it's too small, your betta will only survive in it and develop bad habits and will not thrive in his environment. Kinda like you and me, we can survive living in a small room if we're fed properly, but we won't thrive and live to our maximum longevity without enough room for exercise and entertainment.

Yes, entertainment/discovery. Experienced betta owners will tell you that bettas do get bored, and that is one of the main reasons they'll start biting their tails and once they do, they tend not to stop. Imagine, your fish looking raggedy like a used cloth, and the reason you bought him in the first place was his beautiful long plumage. How do I know this? Many pet owners will agree with me that your loving pets will tell you what they need. And, you just know if you care about them in return. Big aquariums have enough room for your fish to swim around for exercise and discovery.

The belief that bettas prefer small environments is false. My bettas swim to every corner of their 2.5 gallons and do what they do because they don't just have a place to live but a whole environment to thrive in. The same principle applies to us, humans. Your pet will live longer with you if he has enough room to swim around for exercise. (Update: My bettas are now in 6-gallon Fluval Edge and 5-gallon Fluval Chi aquariums).

In case you don't know, experts recommend changing water for one-gallon aquariums at least once a week. My suggestion is twice a week for Umbra's because you'll see that by the third day your betta will produce quite an amount of bodily waste that pollutes his water. Living with ammonia build up for more than a week will cause your bettas to develop bad habits or GET SICK. Not to belabor the simile, like you and me, bettas live better in a clean house. So, with Umbra's, you'll have to either get a filter or be CHANGING WATER CONSTANTLY, a huge inconvenience if you have a busy schedule. Large aquariums have enough water to temporarily dilute the toxicity of waste and usually come with filters. The filter keeps the water cleaner longer so you don't have to change the water as often.

Small aquariums like Umbra's will also experience FLUCTUATING WATER TEMPERATURES (if no heater) and your betta will just sit around looking lifeless because he's cold. If you install a heater with Umbra's FishHotel, let me ask you: will your chic aquarium still look chic with a long black electrical cord jutting out from the bowl and into the electrical sockets? Plus, since most betta's aquarium heaters do not have button/setting for adjustments, small bowls like Umbra's don't have enough water to offset the heat. You might end up overheating your poor betta.

If you like attractive well-designed aquariums, I'd suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluval-Chi-Aquarium-Kit-5-Gallon/dp/B003TM1BAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluval Chi Aquarium Kit, 5-Gallon</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluval-Edge-12-Gallon-Aquarium-with-42-LED-Light-Black/dp/B005X88XIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluval Edge 12-Gallon Aquarium with 42-LED Light, Black</a>&nbsp;Since you're gonna pay premium for aquariums anyway, you might as well make a better-valued investment. These not only look stunning, they come with a powerful filter, LED lights, the whole package for you to properly care for your betta. Another pro about these is you could add other fish as neighbors/tankmates for your betta. More importantly, these are real aquariums, not bowls which Umbra's FishHotels are. Bowls are for soups, not pets.

Another reason NOT TO BUY this is even though the design looks cool, you won't see your betta very well with those covered areas that supposedly should act as ""hiding places"" for your betta. They'll significantly BLOCK YOUR VIEW of your pet, decorations, and everything in the tank. WHAT ABOUT DECORATIONS? If you like to decorate your tank, making a little zen heaven for both your fish and your room, Umbra is too small to do so. At most, you can put in gravel and a couple of silk/plastic plants (live plants will probably be too big and sensitive to live in bowls like Umbra's); otherwise, your pet can't swim around.

Lastly, how about that this aquarium is way OVERPRICED? Why didn't they have the bowl made out of acrylic and reduce the price in half?

If after reading my review you still want to purchase it, please do and check it out for yourself. I just hate to see you buying an overpriced product and will discard it when you see your pet suffering.

Hope this helps.",2
This is so cute and my dog loved it but she could pull off mouthfuls of the tennis ball type material so I had to take it away. If you use just to retrieve and then put away it would be fine. I was disappointed.,3
A real hit!  No GI problems!,5
"Vir back never disappoints me in terms of quality, my greyhound is a soft chewer, she usually chocked with biscuit that are too dry, the hard virbac chews are quite dangerous to her, so this veggie chews are amazing, they are not too hard nor soft, just the right amount of hardness to be safe for a dog that had her teeth broken with hard stuff.",4
"This thing does give your dog something to do, but my dog was just too big for it and was easily able to remove the little squirrels from the inside. After a few days, my 90 lb. dog ripped open the squirrels and could no longer play with them. Oh well.

Would be great for smaller dogs.",3
"LOVE this product. I have a 7 month, 40ish lb lab/retriever mix. I wanted a harness that could grow with him. with having no training yet he walks great with this and its gentle. I will buy another if I ever need to replace it.",5
I found this while searching Amazon for another product. I put this to use in a different fashion. I installed it on the front of the house next to the garage. I used tapcons to attach to the house. It is a great product. Our dog has freedom now and the tie out doesn't get stuck on anything.,5
"I bought one of these for each of my 3 Rat Terriers.  They fit great and look and feel very soft and comfortable; also very durable. They don't rub and chafe my dogs at all. The only complaint I have is that as my dogs shed the little short hairs get caught up all in the harness and it is very difficult to get the hairs out.  I usually have to end up washing them, which usually removes most of the hairs.",4
"I've had this kennel for a couple of years. There's not much to say about it -- it just sits there. It sits there very well. It assembled easily, and I've had no trouble with it. Of course, I have a pet bed in there for my dog. But, I wanted more padding and insulation under the bed. I bought a few feet of gray, rubber-ish anti-fatigue mat from the bulk-roll at Lowe's, and cut it to fit the bottom of the kennel. This was an Amazon Warehouse purchase. There was a mild mar across the top, but, its not easily noticed.",5
Works as advertised,5
good quality.,5
Tedious to separate bundled plants and cover various root configurations with planting mix.  We will need time to rate appearance,3
I discovered these sand perches are just plastic with some kind of grit stuck on.  I had to buff down because grit was to sharp for my birds feet - in doing so that is how I made this discovery.  Unfortunately I bought a number of these thinking that they were in fact sand perches.,1
Durable worth the money. My dogs used it occasionally.,5
I use this to monitor my Axolotl temperature. The only thing I wish it had was an alarm that went off when the temperature was out of range but for the price? This is great,5
First time buying springtails and I'm happy to report the culture is doing great. I actually have an over abundance of springtails!,5
Perfect as usual. Thanks! ,5
Good quality product.,5
My dog didn't like it she literally walked out of it,3
Dog was able to chew through this rope surprisingly easily.  He had it unwound in less than a week.,3
"This is great in theory, not so great in practice. I have a terrier-beagle mix and she had the blue fuzzy part torn completely off the within the first half hour. There was blue fuzz EVERYWHERE, it looked like a smurf massacre. While the toy is still usable without the fuzz, it becomes slimy with slobber when the dog uses it. I will not purchase this again. If you're looking for a 'quiet' or 'silent squeaker' check out the line by Hear Doggy.",2
I got this for my biocube 14 to replace the bio balls after watching the smiley Dakota series on YouTube for starting a biocube. Definitely a better alternative than bioballs which can be a nitrate factory. I use this with seachem matrix carbon and seachem Purigen really does the trick what looks clear. It is also easy to rinse during water changes.,5
"My recently rescue dog has gum disease and her vet recommed brushing her teeth daily so bought the tooth brush and toothpaste but that is a slow process. She loves the chews and gets one daily and after a week, I can see a noticeable improvement. The brushing is still ongoing but these chews really help and there is no fuss.",5
"We have two long haired dachshunds and I swear by all of the fur monster brushes. It's been a long summer and my poor guys haven't gotten brushed in two weeks, they had many tangles and this really swept through them... I also recommend the furminator regular pin/soft brissell brush and the furmanator de-shedder",5
perfect fit,5
"We use this everyday for 1/3 of her breakfast. She LOVES it and she doesn't gobble. Pit/boxer/boston mix 40 lbs. I just wish it dispensed more slowly, but I have found nothing slower mainly because my kibble is small, but all Nature's Instinct is.",5
Dogs love it.,5
"I have used this product for four years. Obviously, I am satisfied with it!",5
Comb works great on grooming my angora rabbits!,4
This stuff is amazing. Over the first week we watched the tank get more and more pristine. The fish really do look like they are floating in air,5
I just opened the box that I got the other day and was very surprised that these are not like it says they are.  They are NOT 28 x 35.5 and the quilting does not even got to the sides on the large piddle pad tray.  Totally unusable for us since my little male dog likes to give the edges a run for their money.  These are going back.,2
This is so cute!  It appears to be pretty thick and good quality. Ordered size small for our 6.8lb yorkie. She can make anything look precious!,4
"Had to find right treats to fit. Also, treats do not fall out most of the time and my pups lost interest...",1
"This is a really good purchase, was received as described on Amazon. I will purchase this again due to quality, price and convenience.",5
dogs love them,5
"I waste a lot of money for a pellet for find my both bird eat it well.
I finally found !!! I'm so glad , they start to  love  this pellet .

Green Cheeked Conure eat (hand feeding bought from breeder)

when he ate pellet always said ""GOOD BOY "" and very happy attitude to him
after he grab few pellet by his feet and move to beak same time  look at me all time.

if your bird do not eat pellet  bird find one master from family .
they trust most of time , that person train then very fast to learn .
if no trust between bird hard to change to seed to pellet , because
parakeet was too old to train because he do not listen to what human said
he just trust my GCC only. if he eat parakeet scary cat but start to eat same thing.

GCC
75~80% pellet a day (lafeber's)
20~25% veggies& fruits, safflower seed ,millet as a treat .

parakeet (still train to eat pellet)
20%~30% pellet and veggies& fruits (lafeber's)
80%~70% diet kaytee's seed

PARAKEET
(bought at pet store not hand feeding . he still land on me  but still scared human's hand )
First time did not touch pellet at all , but i beat a pellet and make like almost powder,
My GCC start little bit eat 2month ago it because i show parakeet that's food.
your best friend eat it .  they fly at house few hours a day ,
i only give them pellet out side and let parakeet try to eat same pellet as my green cheek dose .

My birds tried in since may 2012  1 GCC and 1 parakeet both male )
(after fist check up at vet i found out i have to check poop color is healthy i studied i prefer Never give again colorful pellet)

Zpreem's pellet  natural color (never ate) fruit one just grab bananas one and just bite little bit and throw bottom of cage.
kaytee's pellet rainbow never eat it .  natural color never eat it .",5
Good value for typical quality kennel lead.,5
My dogs ABSOLUTELY love these!!!,5
"When we adopted our very, very large dog from a shelter about 4 months ago, it was obvious that she'd never had any training. She was around 4 years old and was a sweet girl but she was constantly jumping on us and lacked even the most basic manners. I knew I needed to train her before she knocked someone down and really hurt them.

I ordered this pouch to keep training treats (we used small pieces of Pupperoni that I cut up myself because it was economical) in. I filled it up, closed the drawstring and clipped it to my belt loop. I kept it on all day and gave her treats to reward her for good behavior.

She's a smart girl and because she could smell the treats attached to my hip, she stayed close by all day trying to earn treats. Because she followed me everywhere the training went by quickly. I like using positive reinforcement to train and I would never yell or spank her. Not only is that cruel, but your dog won't trust you if you don't treat them with love, kindness and patience.

The treat bag was well made and I found it easy to use. The opening was big enough to get my hand in and the larger size of the pouch meant I had to fill it up less often. When it got dirty, I just tossed it in the washer and let it air dry.

It took about 3 weeks of constant training for her to learn not to jump up on people, how to sit, stay, lay down, and even shake hands. Having treats on myself 24/7 helped keep her focus on me and what I was trying to teach her. This bag is awesome!",5
"My dogs love these, and because of their allergies, are some of the few treats they can have.  It's hard to find this quantity for the price.",5
"My dog love these for training treats, they don't get all crumbly and they last awhile.",5
Runs on batteries and not for very long. I used once and was over it pretty quick.,3

It is an outdoor toy, because the noise it makes is intensely irritating to anyone not, presumably, a nine-week old puppy. It is fairly heavy, but that doesn't bother him a bit. It came with several different covers; his preferred one has a tail on it for better thrashing, and another has ears he can use to beat it into submission. The third one we put jingle bells in because there wasn't much of a handle--mouthle? on it and he loves that as well (not to mention we can let that one in the house since it isn't going ""arf arf arf whoyyy [dejected]-yelp"" or sounds to that effect. It quivers and shakes and bounces a little, but doesn't really move far. First time he met it chowlet hid behind the deck but shortly sidled out with an look of ""i was just examining it from a distance,"" manned up, and pounced. They've been besties ever since.",5
"Fits our 14 week old German Shephard puppy really well- comfortable, nicely adjustable and cute! Love the Velcro for the patches- easy to put something else on there if you need to. Good value.",5
"Looks great, easy to put together. Looks nice on patio, but so far, my do go won't lay on it.",4
"I have now bought two sets of tags (one for each dog). They came perfectly and without defects. The first has seemed to hold up so that is why I ordered a second one for my puppy. They don't provide tracking for the shipping but both times things have shown up with-in the time frame posted on Amazon (the first day usually). The second one I just ordered was XL which I have put on my 65 LB, 1 year old hound mix and because of his thin body and elongated face the tag does seem a bit big for him but that is no one's fault but mine.",4
My amazon loves it!  It has a little 'door' in the back and I filled it with his favorite treats.,5
"I have used this damn cage for almost a year for three mice. The tubes on the side busted, the base of the entire thing cracked and its a complete NIGHTMARE to put together and keep clean. I hated this cage. And somehow, my mice always found a way to get out of the stupid thing. Save your sanity, don't buy this stupid thing.",3
Great for my Goldens,5
I have two cats.  One loves these.,5
Doesn't do anything - needs noise to correct dogs.,2
Golden retriever plays with this with his friends- tug of war. Lasts a long time.,5
I switched from Spots Stew dry food to Merrick Before Grain after I realized that the dry Spots Stew isn't grain free. My cats like it and I'm happy.,5
I have been buying these for my dogs for several years. The dogs love them. I've tried other less costly brands but my dogs like these the best. The Amazon price is about 4-5 dollars cheaper than a grocery store.,5
Love how easy to clean this brush is!  Makes me want to brush the cat more often.,5
Works very well,5
"I was so excited to find this heater after we had moved to a new place with cold tile floors, so I ordered one to help keep my dog warm at night.  My dog hates this thing.  It works great and it stays warm until you put pressure on it and then it heats up quickly, but the plastic has a strange smell and made a noise when she stepped on it the first time and she has refused to step on her bed since I put it under the liner.  This product worked great and did exactly what the ad said, it fit under the padding of the medium Integrity Worldwide Orthopedic memory foam bolster bed just fine, but my dog wanted nothing to do with it.",3
birds love these. good thing I have a small Parroette and a Cockatiel because the one Cuttlebone was broken in half.,2
"with all the food scares of products being made these days, it is hard to navigate around all the recalls. AvoDerm products have stayed above the fray and offer my cats a healthy and ""tasty"" (now that is subjective) food. For SOME reason, they will not attempt to eat the large pieces of whole chunk tuna (crazy I Know), so I have to break it up before I serve them and they eat it all",5
"this is so worth the money, I love it and so does my umbrella cockatoo.",5
Our Australian Shepherd hates the rain and this is perfect for him - fit well (he is 55 lbs) and easy to put on.,4
it works,5
"This is my two cats' favorite dry food. I had given them Hill's Science Diet brand (later discontinued), followed by Call of the Wild (which later had month-long wait times on Amazon...), and now this. They were OK with the other foods, but they are actually excited about this one. My only gripe is that ordering two 3 lbs bags via Amazon costs a bit less than a one 5 lbs bag, which does not make any sense. After the initial 3 lbs bag I went to my local grocer and bought the 5 lbs bag, which had a better price, as expected. I believe this product is widely available. I do not know who set the strange prices on Amazon, since it surely cost them more to ship the smaller bags twice, than the larger bag once.",5
"I'm not great at DIY furniture so this took some huffing and puffing to put together. The frame had to be ""crooked"" to get all the screws in place. then I had to force it into square and hold it very firmly while tightening the screws completely. Difficult for one person.",4
"One of these bulbs burned out after only two weeks, which is a bummer.",3
"Good bones, but too big for my Little dog.",4
It's exactly what I wanted and the pricing is great!,5
My dog used to love chewing on these and then for some reason he doesn't like them anymore. So I break them apart and put it in his food.,4
My rabbit loves it and is healthy for rabbits,5
Cats love it.  Saucy and small bites.,5
Best dog shampoo and product line ever made.  I have never had problems with fleas since using this shampoo on 10 dogs.,5
I needed this to help keep my pond clear  I guess I need more because the pond is not clear.,3
"Love this litter box! My kitten took to it right away. I've had to clean her other litter box less often because of this addition, and haven't had any smell issues. Great for those that travel for work or fun - less concern about possible box issues. My kitten started at 4 months which is 2 months younger than the company suggests, but I've had no issues. I'm going to try the permanent plastic tray and see if I like it since it's cheaper than the disposable cartridges.",5
"Love easy to carry with you,, it is a little heavy wish it was a little thinner. Overall glad I bought since we spend time at hospitals, doctors and on the road",5
I have Basset Hounds and the youngest pup is a bit yeasty. This shampoo has been part of the solution.,5
Great shampoo. No hot spots after bathing on my dogs and the old cats were soft and silky.,5
"When the product description said ""Gravel Tube"", they really meant exactly that.  To my surprise, what arrived was just the clear portion of the gravel tube.  While it was the proper length, I was expecting to receive the complete Gravel Tube that included the ""handle"" with water on/off switch as depicted in the product photo.

I ended up returning the tube since I had no use for it without the rest of the assembly.

Not recommended unless you already own the Aqueon cleaning kit to use the 18"" tube.",3
"I hardly use this as the few times I did, it slid all over the front seat. I have a Jeep Cherokee and it wouldnt stay put.",1
I have been using this product from the time I have adopted my Min-Pin at the recommendation of his vet.  The product protects your dog from more than fleas such as Mosquitos plus. The product only has to be applied once per month and is mild to your dogs skin. I normally purchase the product from another vendor which was at least $30+ more.  This Amazon provider has the same product for less and it was shipped and received sooner than the shipping from my previous vendor.,5
My cats love this and it's such fun to watch them play with it!,5
it looks so good on my little angel is thinks she is a princess,5
"Perfect is all I can say. Super fast delivery. Only problem was when they were shipped the top of the bag was open?? So you could see what was inside. Strange never had anything delivered to me like that. But good product. I did notice that so far 1 roll is torn right down the middle on all of the bags. But good product,I'm happy",5
"I'm writing this review because these treats are helping my cat get through a rough patch with really low appetite... she will hardly touch anything except these treats (and one other brand, which are a lot less healthy and contain all sorts of junk). So, I am grateful for these. They actually smell good, like jerky or something (I've almost been tempted to try em, but haven't). I'm docking one star because although the bag says ""moist"" my cat has always found these treats to be pretty hard and rubbery and difficult to chew (actually the way we're using them at the moment is ground up with some added water). PS in case you are wondering, the other brand of treats are ""Temptations Catnip Fever MixUps"" - which is like McDonalds for cats, its terrible but any food is better than no food in some situations.",4
This was a hit with the dog. He doesn't put it down. After five weeks it's still not torn apart.,5
"I buy these online because they are cheaper from Amazon than any other local pet store in my area.  I don't see much difference between these and the regular filters.  They both seem to do the job well.  When the prices are close, I'll buy these instead of the regular ones, but there really is no personal rationale behind it, because both type of filters seem to do the job adequately.",5
my husky is addicted to these and she loves the like crazy. thank you for sending them ever so quickly.,5
"Fast shipping.  This tie out stake has made it's way all around my yard with little effort in getting it into the ground and it is extremely sturdy and well built.  I was a little worried about trying to get this into the ground as I'm a pretty petite girl! NO WORRIES, you can do it too!!!",5
The reason I gave it one stars is my cat hated it. Sniffed it and walked away. It is probably good for a non picky cat (and if you have one of those aren't you lucky lol) I wound up donating it to the local shelter here where I know they are not picky. I guess I will have to stick with Sheba which is all she will eat. At least that is grain free.,1
As expected.....great blade for very close shaving...ie. hair between the pads,5
Love it for my canine.,5
Well-made. Nice colors. Dog hydrated. Success.,5
I actually feed this to my Prairie dog and green cheek conure to mix their food up. They both seem to like it,5
The rabbit likes it and it's reasonably priced. The dust doesn't seem to be too much of an issue either.,5
My hamsters love it. It gives them a place to play. Just as described. Also good size.,5
"I love this food, it's one on the lowest calorie healthy weight foods.  But my bag must have been tossed around a great deal, as there are so many crumbs in this package.  Guess I'll just have to buy it lically",3
"As the owner of seven cats I have tried so many brands. This is by far the best. No odors, low tracking, tight clumps.",5
"Does the job, a little poor design in how it stays on the dogs head. If she tries hard enough she is able to take off the muzzle but has been trained to not fight it. Unable to control herself around other animals so this has saved our cats life on multiple occasions.",4
"Sturdy bed, well constructed and easy to clean",5
I've ordered two of this in the past and the quality is very good.,5
My handyman was able to install this quickly into a vinyl custom door and merely seal where the panelling in the door made an extra little opening. It fits my little minpin just fine and she began using it right away much to my amazement. The cover for when you go away is easy to simply snap on. I couldn't be more pleased.,5
My 2 territorial female felines have been much calmer since I started using Comfort Zone.,5
Dogs played with this for approximately 5 minutes until they figured out how to disable the squeaker. Then it was no fun.,5
"My dogs love them, bought 4 so they'll have their favorite bowls forever. Use it for food and water.",5
The table is very sturdy for a larger dog.  My dog is havanese and only 10 lbs.  The downside of these cables is that they make your hand smell chemically after handling them.  I would recommend leaving them outside a while and get a bit weathered and smell less...,3
"I have only used this product on my dogs once, so far, but already I like it. It smells great, is non-toxic so I don't have to worry about my dog getting sick from licking themselves while I'm trying to give them a bath, and it seems really get the dogs clean. I have 2 Labradors and when they get dirty, they are hard to get clean. I'm confident that once I use this bottle, I will be purchasing another and another. Also, the shampoo is very sudsy with very little soap, which is way better than some other dog shampoos I have used.",5
great quality leash.  no complaints here.,5
My diabetic cat loves these.  He is pretty finicky and I am trying to keep weight on him.  No complaints.,4
My dogs love them. Great for giving pills.,5
Overpriced and really not that nutritious. Can contains one cup of liquid. Cat would have to consume entire can in a day for any possible benefit. Awful ingredients too - read the label. Very disappointed.,1
Perfect for my cage. Plan on ordering more,5
"This was a perfect sized replacement for an e-collar by Petrainer (we got the yellow). Unfortunately, our smaller dog still pulled at this and chewed it off our two Great Pyrenees (for size they weigh 125lb. and 135lb.), whom actually wear the collars. We ordered another in black and he ate that one too. These are a great size but I just wish they were a little harder for a 35lb. Frenchie mix to destroy by pulling at them on another dog.",4
"In Delaware, snow is not a frequent visitor. This weather channel - named Jonas gave us quite a bit and I have had an opportunity to try Eco-Pup. Goes on smoothly, and my pug mix, Milo, who licks everything, left it on his paws with no attempt to remove it. SO far, so good!",5
"My little dog Ginger does a dance whenever she sees the package for these. They are easy for her to chew, and she loves the taste. Hopefully that glucosamine and chondroitin will help her to keep doing that dance: she's had trouble for a long time, and the joint health formulas for food and treats have given her a lot of improvement. She used to cry if she even tried to climb the stairs, but now she's just a bit too stiff for jumping and not showing any signs of pain in general. It seems like a win-win scenario: a treat she loves and a new lease on life.",5
Very nice,5
Fish love these!,5
"Our Mal has not been able to tear it up after a couple of weeks but she is sure trying!!! Great toy, highly recommend.",5
"I bought one in black and then my cat got it caught on something. Bought him a replacement in blue and the neighbors found his old one before we got the new one. The embroidery is nice and it lasts. I do think that these might be a little too easy to ""break away"" for my cat though as he's done it a few times with both of them.",4
"I just used my ramp for the first time today and it is great. I previously had one of the tri-fold ramps, but it was just too heavy and bulky. While this one is longer (when closed up) it is flatter and lighter, therefore much easier to store in the car. I am using the ramp for two Golden Retrievers on a SUV and the size is perfect.",5
My cats love this.  All sizes and ages.  They could spend the day with it just watching and chasing.  The wand falls off to easily but I also have very active cats.  They get excited when it comes out and follow it back to the storage cabinet.,5
This is the best catnip toy on the market. Even the older cats enjoy playing with the banana. It helps get the lazy cats playing again.,5
Cat only likes toys that I hold and monopolize my time.  Will not play with anything by herself.  But the four year old thinks it's cool.,3
My kitty loves these bowls,5
"This perch is just terrific and both my two cats love it--Every day they compete to see who gets first dibs!  I should have bought two since it's not long enough to fit both of them.  I have a wall of full length sliding glass doors in my living room and figured this unit would be perfect since it's big enough to attach to the slider window.  I positioned it about a foot above an ottoman and they both really dig being up high and looking out the window.  One of my cats is big (12 lbs) and this perch hasn't budged since I put it up a month ago.  And I love that I can easily take it down to clean the glass!!  This unit would also fit if you have an average sized, non-paned window.",5
"This toy is marked made in China, yet it says made in USA within the product review.  I'm not going to give my dog toys or treats or anything made in China.  HOW VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR A PRODUCT TO BE MISLABELED AS A USA PRODUCT ONLY TO BUY IT AND SEE IT MADE IN CHINA.  Now I have to pay to return it.  Dog can't play with new toys, I am inconvenienced.",1
"Not as large as I anticipated.  This was purchased for my cavies but it's too small.  If you are looking for a playpen, make sure you get a larger one if its for your guinea pigs.  Otherwise, this would work for small rodents.",4
My cats constantly fight over this. They wake up extra early so they can eat and then go right back to sleep on this mat. Youngest cat will skip breakfast to steal this mat from older cat.,5
This plants roots are ridiculously strong and the leaves are dark. Will make a great addition to my tank. My Angels will love it.,5
"Dog likes it. Material seems flimsy, but he hasn't ripped it yet...",4
"dog loves it, she came to us as a basset rescue, not having been fed for three weeks prior to adoption.....VERY underweight, but this high protein puppy formula has started to ""fatten her up"" quickly.",5
This helps our cat with travel anxiety.,4
FINE,4
"really needed a hard plastic ball for our toy poodle to play with. Needs to be about a size 4"" in diameter. Guess no one makes the smaller sizes anymore.  I would love to be able to sell the smaller sizes in my online stores.",4
"Cat was able to pop the ball out and give it to my dog (she gives lots of things to the dogs....I think she is trying to kill them lol), luckily its a super hard ball and they couldn't chew it apart but it's small enough a big dog could try to swallow it.",3
Bowl is slightly thinner then expected but the color is gorgeous and looks even better than pictured! This 8 cup bowl is huge but will work fine and my doggy seems happy with it too!,5
made in India - I missed that - small letters on lower left back of package - wouldn't have bought it since it is not made in USA,3
My little sheltie will do anything for one of these little treats. He was trained with them and still loves them. They are small enough to keep on your pocket during walks or training and also great to sprinkle over food for an extra treat. They keep fresh in their resealable bag for about 4 months.,5
"works great, it is all natural it remove the plaque.",5
much better than rawhide and extra bonus for skin and coat,5
A+,5
Great product. Love it.,5
"Best stuff for my macaw and amazon. They love, love, love this stuff!",5
The noisy water flow other reviews mentioned is not a problem here. I followed the recommendation of another top reviewer and washed this with bleach water prior to putting it in service. I also use only distilled water to top it off. It took about a month before I changed out the carbon filter. This is a great design and I think it will last quit a long time.,5
I bought this for my mighty chewer dog and he loved it.  He chewed on this thing until he hurt himself on a sharp edge.  I had to take it away from him before he did anymore damage to himself.  I would not buy this again.  I'll have to find something else for him.,2
This is the only ball that my English Bulldog likes.,5
great deal for the price my dogs looooove them,5
Love it!! I don't have to check the water dish every day and thesis much more stable that the one you use with a 2 liter bottle. This one is sturdy so no more spilled water mess.,5
"She likes it, the singing didn't last very long, she still plays with it",4
"The Gentle Leader is a lifesaver.  I've used it on my last two dogs, even my medium sized one.  It just makes walking so much nicer.  I got one for my neighbor, too, so her elderly mom could walk their dog while they were out of town.  Works great for kids, too. Love love love this!",5
